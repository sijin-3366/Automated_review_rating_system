4.0,"Happy there were adjustable straps. The black fabric was a bit thin and see through, but fine for summer. The length is great for shorts. This could easily be dressed up a bit with accessories."
4.0,This bag looks exactly as pictured. The bag is of good texture I like it a lot
4.0,"Soft and fuzzy, warm. The zipper seems to be off center, but it's just a cover up to run errands."
4.0,"I like the shirt. I'm usually an XL, but I ordered a 3XL... and I am 5'8&#34; and 200 lbs. It fits pretty good. The sleeves are a bit odd by the neck/chest area and a bit tight, but not bad. The material has a rayon feel to it. I haven't tried to wash it yet. The sleeves are more of a greenish aqua rather than blue. But it's cute! Just order BIGGER than you would normally wear."
4.0,"This shirt fits me not like a tunic as in the photo (which is fine because I tuck my shirts in anyway), but is surprisingly nice considering the price. The quality is not excellent, but it's cute and worth it for what it costs!"
4.0,"This is really beautiful and soft and sexy. It's a little small on me, order one size up."
4.0,"Beautifully sewn, lightweight cheaper material but looks great on and is comfortable to wear. pants are very wide but will have to fix them because the jacket and vest are adorable. Ours has white trim near the pockets."
4.0,The person I bought it for loved it
4.0,"This fit perfectly as the size chart shows!  Material is great, but kinda see through."
4.0,Very pretty necklace but the heart is smaller than what I expected.
4.0,but passed on to my daughter!  very thin material but still cute!
4.0,"A bit too small, get a size up if you like it"
4.0,TOO BAD NOT A REAL SMOKY TOPAZ..MORE LIKE SKIN TONE. BUT STYLE IS GREAT IF YOU WANT SOMETHING NEUTRAL.
4.0,"For the price of next to nothing that I paid, I would have been satisfied with a scarf of lesser quality, but I was pleasantly surprised by how nice it was. A little small, but lightweight and brightly colored.  A nice accompaniment for a summertime outfit."
4.0,"This is a rectangle shaped scarf and the fabric is very soft. It’s small enough to wear around your neck without having to fold it up or hanging below your breast. It ties great, it’s not stiff at all."
4.0,These are pretty big and heavy. so definitely not good for kids. The backs seems to move far into the back of my ears and hurts.
4.0,Cute. Affordable. Full skirt with a classic sort of feel. Did not notice the purple flowers on it before I ordered. But it’s cute.
4.0,It large for her age so I kept it for later
4.0,"Very thin light weight shirt. I like to buy men’s t shirts to lounge around the house, there is just something off about this shirt it’s like it’s made cone shaped. It’s loose at the top and tight at the bottom. Same with the sleeves."
4.0,"This dress is beautiful. I'm going to order another! I expected it to be a bit large based on the reviews. I normally wear an XS so that is what I ordered. It was actually the perfect length for me at 5'1. It was a bit roomy up top, I'm small chested, but not terribly so. I decided not to shrink it for fear it would be too short. I like it so much, I've come back to order another color!"
4.0,Beautiful and fit great. 4 stars Bc when you wash them one of the little frills came off. Great addition to her socks and the grips on the bottom help with traction!
4.0,Very nice. Great value fir the $. Great to give as a gift. The heaviness of the jewelry wasn't bad either. I would buy more.
4.0,Cute hat.  Looks just like the picture.
4.0,Espero que mi opinión sea plasmada en las reseñas<br />Estás  camisas es lo que esperaba lo único que me llamo la atención fue el empaque compré 5 de diferentes colores pero la de color KHaki venía empacada en un bolsa que no es el empaque de las otras y me llama la atención .... será que es usado ...no sé pero huele diferente la e revisado bien no tiene falla algúna<br />Recomiendo ser más cuidadosos con las prendas que envían
4.0,VERY NICE SHIRT WELL MADE AND VERY COMFORTABLE
4.0,Great 16th anniversary gift for my wife. She loved it! If mommas happy we're all happy!
4.0,Fits as expected. Good material quality - not flimsy. We did not get variety in our pack. Same pattern was repeated.
4.0,"The robe feels nice and a great value for the price (looks expensive without breaking the bank). The sleeves are not as dramatic as I expected given the “kimono” description. It does run a little large. Overall, I’m pleased with the purchase."
4.0,Thestones are beautiful but the chains easily break.
4.0,Overall satisfaction was there and works very well.  I work overnight security so I'm outside in the cold a lot. It helped me out a great deal last night.  Thank you
4.0,I use them for reading. I can see the words when I use them for reading!
4.0,these are pretty big but good for the price
4.0,"Like it, but runs small."
4.0,The outside is good and sturdy but when I received it the inside material was coming off. I just used super glue and so far no problems. I love the skull print.
4.0,"This blouse is exactly what I needed to go under a sleeveless dress, so I'm happy with the purchase in terms of how it looks. However, it's just a tad large in the shoulders making the sleeves a little too long. Overall, I like it just fine for what I needed and will actually fold up the sleeves to make it hit at the elbow."
4.0,I always have my chapstick accessible now!!
4.0,The jacket fits perfect and the material is good the pants were a bit small. I ordered a M. If you are thick at the bottom consider going up a size.
4.0,[[VIDEOID:b20324b0962dd3a315a5b2307316b21]] Very comfortable band. I love how the metal piece doesn’t touch my wrist which is a big plus since my past bands would leave a bad mark and smell on my skin due to cheap metal. The band does move a little but it’s not bad since it’s flexible and easy to adjust.
4.0,Stylish. Wear with jeans or leggings.
4.0,Very pretty. Worth the purchasing
4.0,They were bought as a birthday present.  They came very quickly and were just as pictured.  I was pleased with my purchase.
4.0,Good enough quality for its price but the bottom part is a little too wide for its size.
4.0,Worth buying.
4.0,"Great fit and super cute -- wore to a wedding and received so many compliments!  I did lose a few of the pearls off of it though, so I deducted a star for that."
4.0,They fit great and they're very comfy
4.0,Little girl I purchased for LOVED it!
4.0,The looked great on and were light weight so they didn't feel heavy on my ears.  They protected my eyes from the sun which was really bright in Jamaica.
4.0,Cute shorts but a bit on the short side. I ordered an XS and the waist and legs were a good fit. Even with being petite these shorts are a bit shorter than expected.
4.0,"The skirt was made for someone 11 feet tall and really skinny. LOL! The elastic waist would fit a size 8-10, but I ordered a Large to fit my size 12-14 body. It's a good thing I sew. I cut the elasic waist band and ties off, folded over the fabric and made a new elastic waist to fit and that adjusted the length as well. I am enjoying wearing the fun elephant print skirt now! The price was right for this fun fabric!"
4.0,"I really like this hat! It hits me just above my ears and is super cute. Maybe I have a small head because I see a lot of reviewers saying it doesn't fit their head, however I love the fit!"
4.0,"very think, not great quality but fix was correct"
4.0,Lightweight... thin but padded comfort
4.0,Cute but fit was tight.
4.0,The wide leg pants are great. The leg length is a bit long but it works
4.0,I should of went up a size. But didnt think of the socks and shin guards. Otherwise they are great shoes.
4.0,Just know that the ball doesnt screw off<br />The top pulls off..<br />It's very nice
4.0,"The only reason I didn’t give it 5stars, cause I thought material was softer, had to iron it cause of wrinkles, but still cute"
4.0,I like the purse. I definitely got my money's worth.
4.0,"The material on these is a thinner athletic material and the sizing is a bit loose, not a necessary a bad thing just a FYI thing.  I washed/ dried normal with other athletic clothing.  These get 4 stars because while they are cute the aren't the best material.  Not great for hard working out just maybe light yoga classes or bar.  The band at the waist is also super small so very little control to the top of it."
4.0,"Cute, just wish it was slightly bigger as it is hard to see any real detail with its size"
4.0,Continuously adjustable. Comfortable to wear. Durable. Can be hard to clean if it catches anything sticky.
4.0,I love this skirt but I’m bigger in the hips and need another size up. I don’t think they make XL so I will have to try to make it work.
4.0,Very nice blouse. Material is very soft thus it drapes straight down if you wear your blose out. I ordered a sz 12 but it was very loose and didn't look right on me so I returned it.
4.0,My wife loved this scarf. I gave it to her as a Christmas gift. High quality item and definitely a fans must have.
4.0,I returned this swimsuit. It's okay but not as nice in quality as some of the others I ordered from Amazon that were only a few dollars more. But it was nice.
4.0,"This is a beautiful, fancy skirt! Went to try it on, and the zipper fell off in my hand! Ugh. I was so disappointed, but I will eventually have it fixed!"
4.0,These bands are so fun to wear! I have so much fun picking out the right band to wear each day!
4.0,"Which means nothing to you unless you have my measurements. Chest 38 waist 36 weight 153 height 5'4. A large was way to big but the medium is perfect. One thing that needs to be improved is the way the zipper is installed at the bottom of the jacket. It is difficult to fit the two pieces together because the straight prong is way to small. When clothing manufactuers want to reduce costs one of the first things to go are decent zippers. Still I give the jacket a solid 4 stars on quality,  and price and go one size short off the  chart. I"
4.0,It’s a cute shirt!!!  Order up 3 sizes
4.0,"These are comfortable and I love the color. I did not get them to wear during hot yoga - just got them for running around, lounge type bottoms.  I walked the dogs in them today and WHEW - they are HOT.  I can't imagine wearing them for hot yoga, I'd probably end up completely overheating.<br />Good wearables for errands or hanging around the house and a good price."
4.0,"It's beautiful, looks great etc ... But my wife complains that it ticks too loud and she hears it when she sleeps"
4.0,"These pants look great and feel great too! Only problem is these pants run small.  I am a average sized guy and usually order size 30, but a 31 in this brand pants would be perfect. Otherwise a five star product."
4.0,Too small for my big head.
4.0,"Bought for daughter for prom. She loved them, but her feet hurt afterward. Really, what can you expect from a heel this high? Only downfall was comfort."
4.0,Doesn’t come with proof that the diamond is real but it’s defiantly in white gold. The 14k is on the backing. Since it’s not a screw on I’m not positive these are real diamonds. I kinda wish I bought a different pair that would’ve taken longer to ship that had the screw on backs just to be safe. I slept with these on for a two days so I don’t think they’ll come off but the extra security is always nice
4.0,Too large. Nice customer service. Possibly working to improve the size. Comfy to lounge in.
4.0,They fit perfectly if you go up one size
4.0,"I like the look & it fits loosely which is what I wanted, but it is a little thin"
4.0,Super cute necklace!  Not the highest quality but for the price it’s a deal.
4.0,Super cute...decent quality.
4.0,Love this shirt other than it was kind of a lint magnet
4.0,"Got these for my son and we like them pretty well.  They're described as ""cotton stretch"" briefs, though they are actually 30% cotton 70% polyester.  Not especially accurate, but the fabric does feel more like traditional cotton than the currently popular dry-fit type of synthetic material.  The fabric is soft and very stretchy, with a comfortable waistband that does not bind.  The sizing is accurate, and with a very stretchy give they'll be pretty forgiving if your a little larger or smaller than the actual size.  These fit close, with tight leg holes - making them ideal for active pursuits where you don't want your underwear riding up and down or moving around.  I personally would prefer a little more give in the legs for everyday wear, but not a big deal.  Overall pretty nice boxer briefs, especially if you like a close fit."
4.0,I like this wallet however I have already had to replace it twice in about 15 months.  The clasp has broken both times.  Granted I have it full which causes stress on the clasp but I would have expected it to be a bit tougher
4.0,Liked the price/value for what I needed to use this product for.
4.0,It runs a little large but very comfortable. Not good for warmth though.
4.0,"Fast delivery, comes in a nice packet , mine came a bit mangled but didn't affect the contents, I took a star because I ordered the yellow color and this looks more like white, I am going to return this and buy the black one.over all nice product."
4.0,"I love them , the quality and the colors will buy some more ."
4.0,I love polka dots and these scarves are cute.  Great price for 4 scarves.
4.0,"Great compression for long days. They have held up well through 16 hr days and washing. Only problem is they are very long, too long. I have to fold then down so they are comfortable."
4.0,lovely but I was hoping for it to be a little loose since I ordered a larger size but no...but I will wear it.
4.0,"Nice and cozy. I must say, for the price. This robe was pretty well made."
4.0,"This necklace looks super cute, however it feels really cheap and the &#34;stone&#34; is complete plastic. From far away, it looks great but I think you could find your bang for your buck elsewhere."
4.0,"It is a nice mask for bearded fellows. It was a little too snug for me, but I’m a big guy, so it felt a bit constricting around my neck."
4.0,"Very pretty dress, lots of compliments. I ordered one size up because people said it ran small but I wish I had ordered my true size as it was a bit too big. The design on the bottom is painted in so I don’t expect this dress to last after a few wears but it is still very pretty and flattering."
4.0,"This wallet was a gift, picked out by the recipient. She was surprised at how big it was, so read the dimensions before ordering. Pretty color of green and lots of storage, but need big purse."
4.0,It is my new beach bag and can't wait to hit the beach with it!
4.0,"I really expected these to be huge on my 95 lb daughter (size S) but they actually fit just about right! I’d say the S is a 0. Despite being just right everywhere else, the waist band is a bit gaping and we need to get her a belt. Also she’s bummed that a few of the pockets are fake, just zippers with no hole."
4.0,"A little thick & awkward, but will keep them warm."
4.0,Great casual dress.
4.0,"Pretty and priced right. Came with tag that gave the price in Renmin B -- interesting.<br /><br />Not quite as blue as the picture, but still very nice. Good length and very soft texture."
4.0,The shoes were too small and there was no invoice in the package.
4.0,Great for my costume. It’s super heavy and would slide off my head whenever I looked down so be cautious
4.0,"These are really cute.  Nice, soft, plush.  My boys enjoy playing with these.  My only complaint is that they come off pretty easily on my sons' small wrists/hands.  I wish there was some kind of adjustable (velcro maybe) closure at the wrist.  I may try adding it myself."
4.0,Necklace is too small but everything else is good
4.0,Good quality but make my feet hot.
4.0,"Crosstop shirts in this style are my new favorite. I’ve gained some weight lately, and these seriously make me look at least 10 lbs lighter. I wish they were just a little longer in the front and shorter in the back. I have multiple colors by 82 days and I usually wear a complimentary colored cami underneath, sometimes with a lace trim. Very flattering cut and colors."
4.0,"This is my first renaissance piece and I’m pretty pleased for the price. The underdress will be very versatile to use with a number of other pieces. The over dress is a beautiful blue. It fits well, just wish the fabric was a bit sturdier too hold shape better in the middle."
4.0,Very beautiful! It did break after a week of wearing so I was disappointed!
4.0,One star off because the snaps in the crotch area sometimes feel a bit awkward. Great quality and color though.
4.0,Makes Great Gift for Bride to be
4.0,Fits okay like the design
4.0,CROTCH IS VERY SHORT.  MY SON HAS TO WEAR THEM  LOW ON HIS WAIST.
4.0,"These were beautiful but snagged up too badly to wear a second time after I washed them in my hosiery bag in the gentle cycle.  When they say &#34;hand wash&#34;, they mean it. It's my own fault but that's just too much trouble."
4.0,Looks and fits great. Gave four stars because I haven’t worn the hat yet and don’t know about it’s quality.
4.0,Cute - but I wish the material was a little more stretchy. It feels a little stiff
4.0,Have same brand scarf in other colors and they are thicker but only one loop. This one is thinner but can loop twice. I like the one loop version better but it's still a nice scarf. Very soft and good quality.
4.0,I love this pocketbook! It is brilliant. Soft and roomy.  Zippers where you need them and pockets in the right places. Definitely 👍It even comes with a dust bag. No a great one but the company at least made the effort to enclose same thing to safeguard the proct when not in use. And who says “affordable” pieces should’t enclosed extras like the high-end product. It makes you feel good about your purchase and it was a GREAT purchase.
4.0,No drawstring
4.0,"I like the look of the pants, and I actually have a number of similar ones from festivals. However these have that slick rayon feeling, the kind that shines just a bit in the light. They’re fine for lounge pants but since they’re 100% rayon they will need to be laundered more than other types of sleep pants, as they hold in moisture rather than wick it away."
4.0,I purchase for the count down feature for officiating soccer matches.  Works well but buttons are sensitive and sometimes the stop/start button gets pressed.  Display is not as large as I would like but works as advertised.
4.0,Dislike… long time to dry
4.0,"Very nice dress, fabric a bit heavy, but that is what the other reviewers stated so I was prepared. Nice that it is short sleeve otherwise it would be too hot for summer."
4.0,"Pants were perfect, jacket a little tight but I have a 52&#34; chest and a 44&#34; waist. Not the heaviest of material and the zipper is backwards (what do you expect from China?) but overall for the price not bad."
4.0,very good work shirt I like the way it has that zipper on the pocket very unique
4.0,Beautiful. Makes her look like a little princess.
4.0,"Comfy, but it does not stay its shape."
4.0,Smaller then expected but cute
4.0,"This design is nice. The setting is smooth. There weren't any prongs that were unbent or standing that snagged on anything. The artificial stones are nice for this price range. The settings are rather close together so you may get kinks in the chain. When this happens gently but firmly pop them back into a straight line. The motion is similar to popping a tiny glow stick. These sparkle nicely under the light, but they won't fool anyone into thinking they are real."
4.0,Very cute and comfy dress. The seam can be somewhat itchy but I planned to wear a racer back tank underneath anyway which will alleviate any irritation. The dress looks a little sheer when held up in the light but once it is put on there is nothing about it that is sheer. Height 5'4 weight 120 ordered a small and it fits perfect. It looks just like the photo even the length so it is long but that was what I wanted.
4.0,Very cute. Warm and fuzzy.
4.0,"These are just what you expect them to be. Locally, I cannot find these anywhere anymore. They are a good quality plastic insert, and so far are holding up well (one month as of review). My various cards fit well, perhaps even a little more snug than my old ones. Good news is the cards will not just fall out if the wallet is dropped. They are significantly more expensive than what they cost locally, but then again, I can't find them locally anymore, so as long as they are durable enough, these will do. The only gripe I have is in the listing. They say they are transparent, but they are not. They are translucent. By no means a deal breaker, but I am used to my transparent ones."
4.0,it’s a nice product...for some reason i thought it would be thicker but that was my fault! Recommend for a Newton fan!
4.0,"While I wondered if it would ever arrive, due to multiple shipping delays, it ended up being worth the wait.  Bought this for my wife, who is a big Hamilton fan.  It fits well and is comfortable over long periods of wear.  Just don't expect it to arrive quickly."
4.0,I wore this dress to church and lunch afterwards. Very comfortable and flattering.
4.0,"normal fit, accurate description"
4.0,My 12 year old son wanted a dressy watch. I had to remove 6 links to make it fit. Looks good and for the price it's a good bargain. He says it looks &#34;lit&#34;.
4.0,One of the posts was bent but I was able so straighten. Nice size for second piercing.
4.0,Exactly what my 13 year old was looking for.
4.0,"Good quality material, not near as long as I had hoped. (Almost shows stomach when I raise my arms. I am 5'4/135lbs and I ordered a Large. Width wise- perfect. Length is a few inches too short for me. I still wear it with a camisole underneith."
4.0,El modelo es exelente pero le falra unos ajuste como  la liga q tiene en la cintura es muy suelta deberia ser mas ajutada para q se amolde al cuerpo
4.0,"seriously need to add a XS/S option<br />the S/M are seriously huge on me, and I'm only 5'2&#34;<br />Other than being too big, they are soft and comfy but the waist is very loose and they fall down because there's nothing to hold them up"
4.0,"Fairly thin, almost legging thickness. Super comfy and on the flowy side. They’re my go to sweats. I order an XL I’m size 16-18 pants and they are right on my thighs and butt but still have stretch. Awesome buy(:"
4.0,Very pretty!  Wife loved it!
4.0,Good quality.  Reasonable price.
4.0,"Dress can be found at WalMart for much cheaper, but couldn't find my size.  This is a great summer dress that can be dressed up or down.  Throw it over swimwear for a quick cover-up or add a necklace, cute summer sandals and light swing jacket and go out for the night.  Very comfortable.  Love the soft fabric.  Color fades pretty quick, but to be expected for all black.  I am loving it!"
4.0,I like the quality but I'm only giving it 4 stars because they are very tiny
4.0,I love the feel of this dress. Perfect for dressing up or dressing down. It does reach my feet but I’m 5’2” so it’s the perfect length for me.
4.0,Fit perfect! Only complaint is that it had a small hole on the side. I could cover it up by wrapping it though so it wasn’t a big deal. Thanks!
4.0,"My 6 year old daughter wore and loved this costume for trick or treating tonight!  I dock a star because it lost a button just during the light trick or treating use, and the back of the bodice is plain white satiny material that is practically sheer, so she had to wear an undershirt.  But hey, it was comfortable enough for her to wear without an undershirt, so that's something; and she was easily recognizable as Dorothy.<br /><br />Plus, I loved the layer of mesh fabric that adds some shape to the skirt.<br /><br />Definitely recommend, whether for Halloween or just dress up."
4.0,"It fit perfect, its very soft"
4.0,They are more of a stretchy legging material but are definitely not see through. Super comfortable and stretchy. Love that they have pockets.
4.0,"Outfit is great quality, however, don't be thrown off by the word &#34;hoodie&#34;. The shirt is really soft but it is NOT a sweatshirt. It is a T-shirt with a light T-shirt hood. I expected to receive a sweatshirt. The quality is so nice that I am keeping the outfit, though."
4.0,"Great shirt! Love the shoulder cut outs and the design of the chest fabric. Everything fit well but, as the shirt is a tunic style, fit even more large that expected in the length and waist. Shirt is a little shorter than dress length on me but found a way to tie up nicely."
4.0,"I wear it when things are going to get messy or I'm likely to knock it into stuff.  Don't want to damage a nice watch.  Cheap, accurate, light.  Only problem for me was the strap is made for tiny Asian wrists, so although I can get it buckled on the last hole, the buckle is way off center and gets in the way.  I had to replace the strap with a nylon NATO strap, which is longer and works better.  Otherwise just fine."
4.0,"Cute swimsuit. I agree with others that the top is too large, granted I'm not incredibly busty. I can't imagine it being very supportive if I were, though. There are thin liner pads in the top that move around alot and are easily visible; wish they were sewn in and full coverage. The bottoms would bit better for gals who aren't a full in the tummy, thighs and rear. Even with it's simple flaws this is still a great suit especially for the price!"
4.0,"Will look forward to attaching these to just about everything. They are great to attach to your UBS flaash drives, your styli, your keyrings, a million and one uses, I am very pleaased with this product"
4.0,"The glasses are nice the color is not bold it's very subtle, the glasses are kind of shear but If I'm being honest these glasses feel somewhat flimsy. They are a bit too small and just don't frame my face how other ones do but I will say that the blue light filter is great!"
4.0,"Really liked the style...however, since I am 5'11&#34; the first lace panel comes up pretty high so it needs to have something under it! Pretty shear which will work out as I am now going to make it be a beach dress...Really like the dress tho!"
4.0,"These slacks fit just right, but I don't like the material.  It is thin and stiff and makes a noise when you move."
4.0,I love it but i should have ordered a smaller size because it was tooo big but she will grow into it<br />Or i will carry it to a tailor to have ot adjusted<br />But its really cute
4.0,Got these for my daughter because she is always needing new soles on her boots and I am tired of paying the high prices to repair them. I gave here these and some shoe goo. She was excited but hasn't actually tried them yet. I will update when she does.<br />they do come with 2 of each section so a pair and packaged in a nice little minimal bag so doesn't take a lot of room.
4.0,Nice in the Hawaiian sun!
4.0,"Thick cotton material, good and bad, a little hot but doesn't wrinkle. It's pilling a little bit already and I've only washed it a few times, good for the price"
4.0,Yankz are great. Huge selection of colors with a choice of black or white plastic hardware.
4.0,"Lovely looking evening bag, just too small for my needs."
4.0,"The wood is hollow from behind, which is both good and bad. Good because it will be nice and light, but a little annoying in that it will inevitably be a pain to clean thoroughly.<br />Appearance wise they are gorgeous. Not sure if it's real opal in the center, but for the price I wouldn't complain if it's not."
4.0,"I love the vibrant color, it is just as pictured! It says the material is soft polyester, instead, it is more like a light, stiff cotton."
4.0,Looks great. Good quality.
4.0,Great Value for the price.
4.0,"These are not top quality, but they also do not have the top price. They fit fine. They are opaque at the smaller parts (calves) and a little thin further up. You can easily see my underwear under them. They are a little shiny. They are definitely more like a heavy pantyhose than a tight.<br /><br />They are fine as an economy tight. They fit as expected and the waist band does not roll down on me."
4.0,These looked great over  normal boots.  I used hem halloween with a Pocahontas costume.  Halloween is a big bar night for me.  These lasted the night but with all the dancing and walking they were worn out on the bottom by the end of the night.
4.0,The bands are very cute but are to tight on the wrist
4.0,Fits great. Awesome colors.
4.0,I LOVE these but they don't fit in my case!
4.0,My fiance loves these cuff links.
4.0,"For reference I am about 140lbs. 5'5 and 38D i ordered a Large<br />FIor the record; Mine was a complete one piece.<br />I wanted to love this as it was everything I was looking for: tummy control, ruched, skirted<br />However it has such a deep V neck more boob was showing than I wanted. I would say if you have bigger boobs this swimsuit isn't for you. Otherwise I really liked it."
4.0,"Fun bright colors for fall and spring. I took off one star b/c the wrist elastic on one sleeve was half sewn on. Light airy material, no stretch. I’m 5’6” 135 and wearing a medium."
4.0,My 13 year old daughter loves it.  It is a nice buy for the price.  Light weight and fashionable.
4.0,"Its a really cute dress but I got the purple and pink version and the middle color is blue and not black like the picture. I happen to like navy so i kept it but not what i wanted.  Also, its very baggy and feels a bit like a dressy muumuu."
4.0,Would had given it a 5 star but the part the adjust the cap has a small lump that is not smooth which you have be careful with and other clothes get got in it. You can sand it down an it works.<br />Easy to put on. Has room for long hair even if you wear big shell hair clips. Cap is made of small mesh material.
4.0,I liked the material and length. Pretty big in the back area.
4.0,"Nice belt, but order two sizes up from pants size.  I ordered one size up and it does fit, but with no extra length."
4.0,The blouse is lovely. Nice material and beautifuly embroidered. Fits to size.
4.0,They don’t look rose gold.  More of yellow gold. They are very nice but I returned them
4.0,"I had some questions for the seller regarding color. They were very helpful and I ended up buying 2 different pairs. They shipped them very fast & so far, they seem well made and comfy. Would buy again"
4.0,"Not a bad pair. Plastic is cheap, but worth the price paid. Sturdy-ish despite the cheap feel on the hard plastic -  the rubber stems, nose pieces and polarized lenses are worth the price."
4.0,"I'm 5', 125lbs, 36b- i'm short and have curves.  It fits great BUT the top portion is a bit loose.  I took to get the sleeves altered (taken in) but it will look awesome.  I may have to take in the hem if it's took long with my heels."
4.0,"they arrived in the morning of my wedding day, i bought something else in case they could not arrived. they looks shining and nice , i wared them an look good! I still keep it for memery!"
4.0,The material is rather thin but love the dress.
4.0,This was a supposed to be a good one but my daughter whose 11 is the one using this but I comes preety tight on her wrist. She’s not big at all but the wrist measurement of this is too small.
4.0,Very cute and well made. One came with crystals missing from the middle of the flower. Still adorable though!
4.0,"looks good, necklace is a little smaller that i would have liked to see on her, but she likes it."
4.0,This cover up is very cute. Soft sweater fabric which is nice. However when it’s REALLY hot out it tends to make you warmer like a sweater would. So that’s a little weird. I just don’t use this one when it’s 90+ degrees out. Other than that i love it.
4.0,Well I thought that I was getting the blue one instead it was the red beaded one cause if payed for the blue one I should of gotten it
4.0,Nice comfortable flowing dress but it is a bit see through. Had to wear a slip under it
4.0,Love this....a little heavy but I changed out the chain for a long soft piece of leather and it's very pretty and now comfortable to wear.  Didn't give 5 stars because the chain cuts into your neck from the weight.
4.0,"I know a lot of people who struggle with knowing what ring to get, I lift weights and do a lot of cardio, so the correct ring at the correct moment is very important to me. Yes, I can just take it off when doing those activities but that has two cons:<br /><br />1- The probability of losing said ring (happened already)<br />2- I dont get to show my commitment (important to me).<br /><br />So, having said that, how does this ring perform? Let me do a FAQ style review to address this:<br /><br />What do you use it for?<br />- Running/Biking/Weight Lifting/Skiing.<br /><br />How about sizing?<br />- This can be tricky, Im a 9 to 9.5 depending on the time of year. According to the measurements, my finger is never 10mm, however, the size 10 on this ring is the correct size for me. I ordered the 9 first thinking that would be it, but it was too tight, the seller however responded immediately and sent me the correct size, great service.<br /><br />Does it bother you when it gets sweaty?<br />- I thought that would be an issue, but really its not. I could go into detail, but suffice to say, I never go &#34;ah, this ring!&#34; when exercising, and that is big, specially running and weight lifting.<br /><br />Do you use it at the office?<br />- Sometimes. It doesnt look like silicone from a distance and I dig the matte finish.<br /><br />Whats your favorite thing about the ring?<br />- That I know, for a fact, that if I fall doing any of the activities I do, I dont risk losing a finger because my ring gets stuck on something.<br /><br />Would you buy again?<br />- I dont expect this one to get ripped but if it does, yes, I would. I did receive this one at a discount in exchange for my honest review but after using it, I would get another one if I lose this one or I fall and it breaks/rips."
4.0,very very very long..but cute..
4.0,"Material is nice quality. Top fits true to size, snug but not tight and I feel confident everything will stay in place 😜 Bottoms are a bit small, they fit but more snug than I would have liked. Overall I am happy with my purchase."
4.0,Everything has been above satisfactory
4.0,"I love the look of this lingerie. Boyfriend approved! However, the material is really cheap and delicate and the slit in the crotch area goes all the way up my stomach, almost to my belly button."
4.0,"This shirt is shear, only hits right at the waist of jeans and is very tight through the bust. Otherwise, I love it. Just wish it had an extra inch in length and a little more give in the bust area. I wear a layering shirt underneath, definitely needed. Love the sleeve and neckline and the color and print are great too."
4.0,"Nothing fancy, gets the job done."
4.0,"I like, color looks great with black boots"
4.0,It was purchased for a super Mario cosplay. It took a bit of shoe polish and a custom logo to give it life.
4.0,Itchy<br />Too big<br />Velcro uncomfortable<br />Bad buy
4.0,"I really love these socks. Great material, great construction. They are what they say they are. The price tag (21$) is a bit steep, even for a serious hiker. But if you want a great pair of socks, at least you know where to find them. Just be ready to pay."
4.0,They were cheap so I didn’t have have high expectations. They popped within a month or so. They honestly lasted longer than I expected.
4.0,"Not as “fitted” as I expected, but it feels great and it does fit size-wise as expected. I love it. Great for a costume."
4.0,It is very comfortable and material is not too thick. It was a bit more stretchy than I thought it would be but material gave a bit so not too clingy.
4.0,Nice pants. Great fit. 4 stars because of no pockets.
4.0,Cute bonnet.
4.0,"would have worked but it is too small on my 3 year old. I bought the 2-4. should have bought the 4-6 but they ran out so i had to just return. the tutu is a little rough but its no big deal. it was for a cat costume and ballet class... if you are looking for a soft looking tutu, this isnt it. but if you aren't picky, this is perfect."
4.0,"muy sastifecho, ahoa solo el tiempo dirá sobre la duración"
4.0,Good; not tight. I use them when I go to the gym. They work well. I don’t think they have a lot of cushion but they’re very supportive on the legs and lower area.
4.0,"These glasses do reduce glare at night. They come in 2 sizes, small, perfect for women's glasses and large which works well with the large oversized frames or men's glasses.<br />I'm not crazy about the ""flip up"" but when you wear prescription glasses that is what you need.  I also bought the large for my husband and he is thrilled. He said it helps his night vision tremendously."
4.0,Fit as expected and shipping was fast. Highly recommend!
4.0,Don't fit tight if u talk a lot they become lose but this might just be they way I've done it but they look sweet and are cool for pics and videos
4.0,One of my favorite watches. Two issues:<br /><br />-Watch band scuffs terribly easy. One day of light working at a desk and the bottom links look like I tried to high-five a wall.<br />-The day-of-week indicator is difficult to figure out. Needs to be set at the right time or it moves unexpectedly. No instructions with watch to help with this.<br /><br />Otherwise looks sharp and keeps good time. Smooth movement for the price range. Would definitely buy again if something were to happen to this one.
4.0,"Efficient, manages to hold all the necessities.  Leather surface appears durable and interior sections well constructed.  The interior of the coin side of the wallet could be better designed, however, as smaller coins can easily move from interior to outside the center section and fall out when you open the zipper.  I also would have preferred a side-slit access for the ID slot rather than a top-access slit for better security and cleanliness."
4.0,There were too small cuse I didn't know that was Asian sise
4.0,This is a great purse.  It is just the right size for my needs. Thanks Amazon.
4.0,Great little dress. I have spent hours looking for a dress I could wear with my boots to a wedding and finally found it.
4.0,I love this sweatshirt. It's super soft and comfortable. I refer to it as my Sunday sweater now. Lol.<br />I am 5'6 and in the real world wear a Med on most things but after being burned a few times with online retailers sizing I ordered a large with this and it is still a good fit but a M would have been perfect as it is oversized anyway.
4.0,This would be great to keep you warm but it is so heavy.
4.0,It's a good product but stitching needs  Be a little better.
4.0,Great product! Just a little smaller than I expected for an adult Medium. But still fits!
4.0,"I like this bag. However, the zippers do stick often"
4.0,Easily ripped as the fabric is thin
4.0,Sunglasses look good. First thing quite dark but barely Polarized. Good for the sun. Satisfied.
4.0,"Finally an Asian dress that fits as expected, using the measurements the manufacturer provided.  Nice color and washes well."
4.0,"nice quality , nice print -fits well but a little long and a needs gusset"
4.0,Nice dress fits A expected
4.0,"It's a little flimsy, and may not hold up long term, but it looked and fit as expected/hoped for."
4.0,Great price for this bag. Sturdy and nice colors. I gave it four stars as the hardware on it isn't as nice as my more expensive one. But I think it will still hold up well and bought 2 different colors. They will get alot of use. Love both colors.
4.0,"these fit fine, they are VERY warm. I started wearing them around the house, and they are just very hot for me. I still like them, but cannot wear for too long.  If you want warm leggings, these are for you! They are super cute though!"
4.0,"Update: It would be important to note that while the photo shows white or whitish buttons (which look ugly to me) the one I received had navy buttons that blend into the shirt- much better. Also, you can feel the texture of the dots which means they were woven into the fabric as opposed to printed. I don't know if that makes this a &#34;dobby shirt&#34; but it adds a touch of class to it.<br /><br />Beautiful shirt with nice contrasting patterns at the pocket, collar, and inside the cuffs. I like these modern button-down shirts but too often they can be over the top with crazy contrasting designs at the collar and cuff. These are just a slightly different dot pattern. The design is great-looking and more conservative than most. I would wear this shirt to work or for a night out. The collar is smaller, in keeping with modern design. I would not call it a slim-fit myself but it's more that than a regular fit.<br /><br />The material is comfortable on the skin and it's firmer, meaning it won't drape on you like some other modern fabrics. The quality is there. I will look for more options from this designer."
4.0,Good quality. Like the feel of the material! Excellent customer service!
4.0,"Product looks as pictured. The frames seem to be sturdy and durable. The fit is a little off though.. not very comfortable behind the ears and a little too long. Overall, good value for the price."
4.0,Adorable and good quality for the price
4.0,"Dress is soft fleece like material. Shows all your curves. My only grip is, the dress is extremely long. Once I have it altered, it will be perfect."
4.0,"So far so good... strap looks pretty good from a distance.  The real selling point on this strap is the price... it's cheap enough to not really worry about the details.  Stitching is ok and looks decent from a distance.  Not much more I could ask for.  This will be a good strap for my watch while I wait for my nicer custom strap to be made.<br /><br />Please note that I bought the dark brown version with black stitching but I'd say that it's more of a burgundy color with a little brown in it, which is what I was going for."
4.0,Love the size. Color isn’t as vibrant as pictured.
4.0,For the money it is a great inexpensive item to use for every day. At this price you can buy a dozen and show off your beads
4.0,Cuts down on eyestrain for sure. The look is like wood grain. I think they are too heavy and get uncomfortable with in an hour of wearing. They do work well tho.
4.0,I hate to only give it four stars because it is a matter of personal taste...It is very bulky to be worn by someone with thin wrists.
4.0,"It is a really nice hoodie, though it is a pretty close fit, so look at the size chart before ordering a size."
4.0,"100 lbs, I usually wear a small so I ordered this in small. Fits perfectly. Cute, warm and comfortable. I'll def. be wearing this a lot this winter."
4.0,"I really thought this item would be a heavier weight, but it was a really thin light weight. More for early Spring or early Fall. But the fit was good and it does seem to be holding up to wear. Not sure about washing it yet. Definitely a delicate cycle cold wash."
4.0,Little baggy in the butt area.
4.0,"We are having lots of fun with these messing with our more conservative friends.  Male ears.  Noses.  Lips.  Even got one on my eyebrow, but the little disc shows so I doesn't look like a real piercing like it does in the ears, lip and nose.  They didn't have this in the description, but they are springloaded, which makes them very easy to put on and take off and the tension is good -- tight enough to stay on but not tight enough to be uncomfortable.  I got the gold ones.  The finish is nice -- a good mellow 14k yellow and not too brassy."
4.0,"Took long time to get,made well,sizing right"
4.0,My glasses want to fall off when wearing a mask. This product stops that.
4.0,"Beautiful fabric and nice quality! Unfortunately, it is a bit shorter than I anticipated. I am 5'11 and only purchased this item because of the good reviews regarding its length. I was disappointed, but I still haven't decided whether I want to send it back."
4.0,"I liked the fit of this dress but didn't like how the liner looked straight across the lace and it was a bit long. I am 5'4&#34; and usually wear a size 6. It fit well overall, especially if you were an inch or two taller."
4.0,Pants fit and look great. Super comfy. Only negative is that the “ink blue” is definitely different in person. There’s no navy tone to them. They're for sure a ceil blue. Kind of reminds me of the scrub pants that I wear to work since I wear a color like that.
4.0,Very happy with this bag. It's just a little smaller than I expected but still very nice
4.0,I Love it !!! Thank you !!
4.0,"Good-looking, the price was right. Thank-You. Shipped in no time !!"
4.0,Great price nice sweatshirt. Just lookes darker in the picture and more like a jacket than it does in person
4.0,"First of all, the shipping container was excellent and well protected.  As a result, I received the product in excellent condition.  Second, the craftsmanship was excellent.  It matched the Fitbit watch with a one size fits all band Small to Extra Large.  Third, the colors chosen were esthetically pleasing.  It caught the attention of those who normally would not notice watch bands.  Finally, and most importantly, the clip-on fitting was perfect and made it easy to change watch bands.  Thank you for making these watch bands available for use.  Much appreciated!"
4.0,"This is adorable. I'm 5'9&#34;, 145lb, usually a size 6/8, and I ordered this in Large. It fits great. I got quite a few compliments on it! It's interesting and stylish without being too sexy to wear around my kids and the other moms."
4.0,Quality is going but they are small
4.0,"This is a great scarf and totally served its purpose. I wore it in the middle of the desert, whilst hiking, and needing to cover my head and shoulders. It was a little hot, but airy enough."
4.0,"Just like the picture. I had it for 2 months now, hasn’t broken.<br /><br />Ps) It was brighter when I first bought it but after a while it gets dusty. Have to clean."
4.0,"Great material! Very comfortable. But I usually buy a medium shirt. After reading reviews, I ordered an XL. Glad I did! These are still very form-fitting. I will wear these to exercise and under something, but no way alone in front of someone, unless I want to show off my belly fat!"
4.0,"Comfortable, pretty and practical. Can be used as a beach cover up or as loungewear."
4.0,I have a small head so this is a bit too big but other than that it looks excellent and looks great.
4.0,"Very comfy, good fit"
4.0,Only flaw is it's one sided. I would buy again.
4.0,A rather nice boot for the price. Well made. Good quality. Good looking. My only issue is that the calf is quite tight fitting and makes fitting of any clothing inside the boot difficult and at times removal is difficult as well.
4.0,"Great running socks for those who need extra support and wear long running pants. Typically my husband likes to run in shorts so these are not good for him as everyday. They are also heavy and would be difficult to wear in the summer weather months down here in Florida. However, I would highly recommend these for cooler climates where running in jogging pants is the norm. Great support and durability. My husband loved the way his legs felt after running 6 miles in them. In his words, his legs felt energized and massaged after his work out. Rated them as 4 stars instead of 5 as they will have limited use down here in the hotter weather and due to the price of $20+."
4.0,Smaller than expected but seems to do its job
4.0,"Fit great and the fabric is good, I am very happy with it and considering buying it in other colors. Maybe just the skirt could have been more pretty in another fabric."
4.0,"This is a nice belt, very good quality.  Comes with it's own little case so its fitting to be used as a gift.  The belt is a little large, kinda tall/thick.  And for me it's like 4 inches too big.  I didn't want to drill/nail holes in it."
4.0,Nice kids glasses. Held up nicely at daughters camp.
4.0,"It smells toxic but the wallet is nice. There is a quote on the button beside the golden bird that says<br />&#34;you to happiness, Bird hedgehog and bees lead a peaceful life in the garden&#34;<br />I wasn't expecting there to be a quote but the wallet is nice sized, holds a lot of cards... etc."
4.0,"I love the design of these gloves. They feel great too, the minute problem was that I didn’t know they had little holes on them on the inner finger areas. Great price for these."
4.0,Love the shirt firs greats but image is little blurry!
4.0,Love how the earring look plus easy to get use to. Would have given 5 stars but 1 post is starting to come loose.
4.0,I measured myself before ordering. But was still a bit on the larger side when received. Beautiful shirt.
4.0,"The jewelery was very pretty. The necklace sits closer to the neck, which is what i wanted. The earings back is kinda big but thats not a big deal. The only problem i had with it was the bracelet would not fit. Even on the smallest notch it was sliding all up my arm."
4.0,Liked the Velcro straps. Comfortabke
4.0,Really comfortable but feminine products don't stick very well.
4.0,Looks nice.<br />Wife likes it.
4.0,Now that I have had to watch band resize to fit me I like it very well thank you very much
4.0,"Great shirt! I love it, but it's just slightly too small for my taste. I suggest getting it a size bigger. Shipping also took forever!!! I don't blame the seller for that one though."
4.0,I love the clean yet elegant qualities of this charm w chain- it's absolutely beautiful<br />I couldn't be happier and am so pleased
4.0,"I was so excited for this package that I tried it on right after work! It fits great, and true to size. I’d say if you’re in between sizes, then go with the bigger size. I do wish there was adjustable straps and better padding, otherwise, I will be ordering more in the future."
4.0,Funny gag gift. Only issue is that it faded fast
4.0,I gave it a 4 stars because it runs big. It’s a cute shirt. If you are tall and have boobs. Which I am not either one of those. Lol . Then you should buy it.
4.0,"It’s really cute. Looks just like the picture. It’s just really big. I got a small, but I don’t even think a xs would fit right."
4.0,"My kids have really enjoyed this tent. It is used in the house and they love it. It was very easy to put together, and it is pretty durable.The sleeping bag and chair are nice too."
4.0,"I ordered the navy tropical in a small, 5'1 36dd, comfy in size 8 but can fit in 6. Based on measurements listed i thought this may run large but thats not the case. While I could fit the small on, it wasn't flattering like some of the others have shown. It is extremely lightweight and soft, great for summer, but i am just going to return because it is thin to the point that I'm not sure how well it will hold up. Ordered for a summer trip to Vegas and this would have been perfect for a few wears (I just prefer a vneck cut since I'm so top heavy.) Tried on again before sending away because the pattern is so nice, the fabric would wash so well, and its sooooo light BUT can't keep it. IDK if its just because I have large chest but this will not stay ""off shoulder"" and pops up way high into my pits. The drawstring at the chest can be tied but it is false. If it were a true drawstring and the top tension could be adjusted it would be perfect. Also this is long on me, so would work great for taller people. Some stray threading, so close to being awesome."
4.0,Seems fine for the price.<br />Wish however the ends would have had a hem in them.
4.0,Fit good except small in the breast Area. If you are larger busted this won't cover much.
4.0,Little short. Bend over it comes right up
4.0,"I love it but... Does not hold my waist, it would be perfect since it holds my body in other places so great, material is smooth and elastic, squat proved, cute for the peachy butt look we gym girls love. Would give 5 stars but is not a perfect fit for me and XS would be too much for me since I do have curves."
4.0,"color ordered burgundy looks a little red, soft, cozy"
4.0,This is a cute dress. Far better than I was expecting for the price. I bought it for my Louise Belcher costume and it works well. Plus there are pockets. It's a little short but it works.
4.0,"I loved the price, however it is very long and you will have to hem.  Good item for the price."
4.0,"I love the chain and pendant, and am keeping this but it is very small."
4.0,"Not the best cord used, but it was worth the price not more looked like the picture."
4.0,Like it.Wish material wasn't so thin but cant wait to use it.
4.0,The hard sole makes these feel less like house shoes and more like stepping outside shoes.
4.0,As advertised. Not exactly waterproof like I needed (I needed it to stop the wet things on the inside from making the outside wet) but it does the job - just damp.
4.0,"These scarves were nice and large & the quality was good. I just thought they were quite pricey considering that they were plaing, with no embroidery."
4.0,I loved it! The only thing is I wish the pants were a bit smaller.
4.0,Beautiful watch. Very sturdy and keeps great time. Very well worth the money. When I buy another watch I will certainly look at the Megir line.
4.0,"Fabulous iconic Gucci sunglasses, if you like big glasses then go for these. They are kind of strange on the face meaning the big round look. However you definelty have to be stylish to accept the look. They are light weight, genuine aunthentic Gucci. Great visual. It’s your beach, going out with friends sunglasses. The reason I have them 4 stars is due to the odd shape. This meaning they are weird looking but you have to definelty be high fashion for the look. I am a lover of sunglasses and I will keep this to my collection. Knock them out of the park with these iconic sunglasses."
4.0,"When I finally received this, they were five. As described."
4.0,Fits like expected. I'm 220 lbs and its comfortable to wear. A bit bigger then i thought but still looks good with what i wanted it for. :)
4.0,"Good for hiking, but the material is little bit hard."
4.0,"They fit my husband really well, but need to have longer options."
4.0,"I get compliments every time I wear this necklace.  It's a great piece.  The only down side (and this is not to deter you, just a caution) is that it's heavy! By the end of the day i'm ready to take it off! But, again, it's beautiful."
4.0,"So I bought a new watch a week before I bought this one, but when it came I felt like it wasn't going to look good with my interviewing outfit and as I am at a point in my life where I would like to make a carer change, that was problematic, so I purchased this one because it looked sophisticated, dressy, and professional. It is a beautiful watch and is water resistant which is great since I seem to be talented at finding myself out in the rain. It is a very basic watch - time only - and as such is easy to set as it is just the pull and twist mechanism to set time and push in to restart keeping track of time. I plan to keep it pulled out when I am not wearing it as I do not anticipate wearing it all the time. I did a bad job measuring my wrist to know what size watch I needed, so the band is too big for me, but that is really no fault of the watch itself. There are directions on re-sizing the band, but I was unable to follow the directions, so I will most likely take the watch to a jeweler at some point to be re-sized. It isn't a big deal though since it looks reasonably like a cute bracelet as it is. The clasp is very easy to use. If I were going to wear it daily I'd be concerned about the spring mechanism wearing out, but as I plan to only wear it on occasion, I am not really too worried about that. My only real complaint is that there are no numbers at all, so you have to watch which way the second hand is moving to know which direction to put it on your arm. I'm sure though once I've used it a few times I'l l just remember whether the knob faces my wrist or my elbow. Overall, I am glad I bought it."
4.0,"Love the color, and the material that is almost like a wicking material. Very comfortable and can be dressed up or down, depending on what you need it for."
4.0,I like this and I think it is cute and comfortable. I think it runs large though it fits loosely on the arms and might make you look frumpy
4.0,"The fit is just fine. I am a 36C in a well-made bra, and ordered Large. These fit with no pinching and no odd fabric roll. The padding doesn't bother me. Don't want to give TMI, but I sorta kinda need padding, otherwise... you know. They also do seem like they would wick sweat away.<br /><br />BUT I agree with the other reviewer who said these are not adequate for running. I want my rack to be kept as still as possible when I run, and these will clearly not be able to make that happen. I'd say they are good for yoga, hiking or some other low impact fitness. I do that too, so debating whether to keep them -- they are a good price. But now I STILL need to search for sports bras that will keep it together while I run."
4.0,love/love/love
4.0,These plugs are so cute and good quality. Only problem is I ordered black and got silver.  I didn’t want to send them back so I just wear them.  I still love them.
4.0,Easy snag
4.0,The show fit wide in the heel and narrow in the toe.
4.0,Love the ring great quality for the money
4.0,"Easy to apply and adjust. Can leave it on while the Versa is quick charging, and pop it back in without difficulty. Fits even my large ankle, but adjusts really to wrist wear as well. Overall, not bad."
4.0,"Bought as a gift and the print is AWESOME! Size runs very very small though, so glad I got an XL for a person that normally wears M/L."
4.0,Good quality material! Only complaint is the strap is not adjustable so I can't adjust the length. But overall very pleased with purchase! Cute color- just as described.
4.0,I wasn’t expecting much for the price but I was pleasantly surprised.  The shirt washes well and is a very soft and durable material.  I received many compliments at Disney!!
4.0,These sunglasses were a hit at my wedding. They are durable.
4.0,It was for my father and because of the size of his foot this didn't fit.  otherwise it seemed like a nice sock
4.0,"This set of earrings is beautiful! Very bright and the metal of excellent quality. Unfortunately the gems are bigger than I expected so it's impossible for me to sleep with them that's, I had to change them for the earrings I had previously flat. :("
4.0,bad fit<br />Didn't like it
4.0,Loved it but see through.
4.0,"I ordered a medium and it came in very tight but manageable. The clothes do not have a gradient on the coat as imaged. The stripes on the coat do not line up at the seam of the waist. The gloves were actually a bit better than I had expected, but they were also a bit small (fortunately I have very tiny hands). Make sure to order a size up.<br /><br />The wig stunned me when I discovered that it already had an undercut built into it! Amazing for Alastor's hairstyle and often lacking in other wigs. I haven't styled it yet so I'm a bit concerned that the bangs might be a bit flat, though the back seems nice and thick. I am looking forward to seeing if I can achieve the needed volume in his bangs and cut while styling it.<br /><br />The clip on ears are curved so they'll be really nice to form definition around while styling the wig. I'm a bit worried about the weight they add to the wig making them droop, but I'll find a way around it.<br /><br />I enjoy the colors of the costume and the quality is very decent. Give it some love and I'm sure you'll shine while cosplaying."
4.0,"They look and feel nice, at least for now but they are sized a little small. I would suggest a half size to size up"
4.0,I like these because only a tiny bit of lace shows up at side of shoes. The toe part does not show at all with the shoes I have.
4.0,"It is a little small, but so sexy. The front slit is very high, not made for someone with a small torso, otherwise, it is very sexy."
4.0,Fits well.  Durable matetal. Comfortable fit
4.0,"I like these as far as fit goes.  The blue lenses are real nice looking as well, but looking through them gives you rose color look.  The style would be like a plastic aviator look.  To be honest they are a little cheap looking and feel.  The case alone is killer, this is the second pair I bought.  Definitely not 5 star glasses, but great generous size really makes it a comfortable for a larger head.  I like the deals you get here on nautica glasses, but for cheap glasses I like Anarchy's better, and Oakley's are the best sun glasses you can get.  I might even buy another pair of these someday, I would recommend them as well."
4.0,"These make a great gift. The cuff links themselves look very nice quality, they are sturdy and polished. The box they come in however is not great quality and kind of diminish the quality of the cuff links. Don't get me wrong, it's not horrible, just not on par with the quality of the cuff links. Another thing I was not a huge fan of, was the fact that there is nothing in/on the box or on the cuff links themselves that state they are 18k gold plated. For the price, I wasn't proof that I am getting what I paid for.<br />overall though, the cuff links are very nice.<br />*I received a discount for my honest review*"
4.0,Works fine unfortunately my bf doesn’t use too often :/
4.0,"I bought this as a gift, but ended up taking the silver necklace for myself because I just really loved it (any animal lover would). The chain is a bit too long for me. It is on a somewhat standard chain, but you cannot adjust the length much."
4.0,"This robe is to replace one I got as a gift about 10 years ago. I loved the first robe and so far love this one. It just the right weight, not too heavy but not paper thin. And it is the perfect robe after a shower or bath, absorbs water better than my towels. The only reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars, is my old robe had slit pockets and the belt was attached, which is perfect, this one does not."
4.0,"The beanie I received looks and feels great.  It has 2 layers.  The first layer is a little snug, but the outer layer hangs in the back like it shows in the picture.  I'm not sure why other people had an issue.  And I've been told by friends I have a big head... :P  Overall love this beanie, just wish it was a tad bit looser."
4.0,They are ok .
4.0,I had used the small versions of the tee at a fitting bay when trying out a new 3 wood. I have trouble finding a consistent tee height for woods and irons.  Using the small tee at 1/2 for woods and 1/4 height for irons.  Instantly improved the tees shots for both.  Would like a package of only small tees
4.0,"This suit is wonderful, just a runs a little small. For my 4-year old we got a 5, and only at 4 years-2 months it was too snug. So I ordered a 6 instead. Nice, otherwise."
4.0,"I bought 3 for gifts, they look nice but a little more casual than I hoped. But for the 20 something year olds that I bought for, I'm sure they will meet there needs."
4.0,"Nice cufflinks, great colors and details: however a bit smaller than I am accustomed too."
4.0,Really cute little shorts for the price.
4.0,Bought these for myself and brother for working on the property.
4.0,Cool looking and fun.  If you stretch them to fit they will come unhinged but you can easily squeeze them back together to customize the fit.
4.0,"Bought for daughter's winter formal. She is a size 4/small, she is about 5ft 5ish for length reference. The company is up front in description that this dress runs small so make sure to check out the size chart. Her measurements fell between their size 6 and 8, we went with the 6 and it fit perfectly. Bonus, it has cups in the front so no bra needed. Wrinkles came out pretty well with hanging near steamy shower. She loved her dress. She said it was comfortable, no itchy fabric and wasn't see through."
4.0,Good for the price. A bit small.
4.0,"This is large on the shoulders, but it's a lovely dress.  It's stretchy and the stitching is good and solid."
4.0,"This is a nice dress.  I usually buy an XL, but on the recommendation of another reviewer I purchased a XXL, and it fit perfect.<br />I received a lot of compliments on the dress."
4.0,Great price and great customer service.  My only complaint is that the sizes are not more differentiated.  I am a size small and had to order a small/medium.  As a result the foot portion is too large and the calf length is too long.
4.0,"I am so happy to have finally found a tunic top that actually fits. I am 5'2&#34;, 158 lbs., 36D, broad back, and I do not like my clothes tight. I purchased the L.  Other L tops were tight across the back and XL were huge. This one fits exactly how I like my clothes to fit!<br />However,  it is not perfect. The color is not as expected (most dissappointing) It's OK, but not as pretty as the colors shown (see pics). The sleeves are a little snug, so I would not recommend this top if you have large arms.<br />Pictured with Yelete capri jeggings (purchased on Amazon), which are AMAZING!"
4.0,"These leggings are comfortable for what I need which was a casual pair to run errands in. They fit a little larger than I expected. They are warm enough for fall. The waistband and material is a bit weird, but works fine for me."
4.0,"I bought a size small and the shirts fits well, except it is a little loose in the arms. I washed it and it did not shrink."
4.0,I wore for Papa's Memorial and it was perfect. Only thing was I noticed right when I was leaving a hole along seam. I fixed quickly. Probably a fluke.
4.0,"Very fast shipping. The size is perfect... not too small and not too big. I purchased these for a gift, so I am hoping the recipient loves them and I will update my review after she tries them on."
4.0,Very good for conditioning  gator and snake boots but doesn't really shine up as much as I would like.
4.0,"Lovely color, large in odd places and really low neckline. With the neckline I did not feel comfortable wearing this to the wedding. Still, it is a dress and bodies are different. Pretty, and seems well made overall."
4.0,"I love the shirt! It’s super cute. The material is very stretchy. The more I wear it the more it stretches out, especially around the underarms. I recommend buying a size smaller to allow for stretching."
4.0,"Absolutely hysterical to see a Unicorn walking by. My daughter loved it. Just a few things to keep in mind..the smell is horrific out of the package. You really need to purchase early and air it out for a few weeks. I can't imagine putting this thing on my head right out of the package. It smelled up my entire garage the first night. Visibility is just so-so. You have to use the nostrils and mouth holes to see. Other than that, its pretty funny. My daughter wore it in a Halloween parade and the little kids loved it."
4.0,The product came right on time (I order it on Wed and it got there Fri) and was almost everything I could hope for.  I was able to cut it down because we only had 8 teams and only do 15 rounds for our league.  The stickers worked great and had all the players we needed and the color coding was perfect.<br /><br />My only problem is the the price is a little high for a one use draft board.  If the draft board was laminated you could use it again next year and only by to stickers i would have given it 5 stars
4.0,"I really like this Capezio leotard.  We chose the soft, pink, pink.  When you select colors remember that there are often two different pinks, and that ballet pink is a peachy pink.  This is a high quality leotard that will last my daughter until she grows out of it."
4.0,The fabric wrinkles super easily.
4.0,Daughter Loved It!!
4.0,I ordered it for my Ordination Ceremony.  It looks good and strong. I have to iron it to take care of the wrinkle.
4.0,"Not like a unity kilt from Scotland.  Not sure if I like the flap in front.  The buckles don't keep straps tight.  However, for the price great product.<br /><br />  If your looking for cheap utility kilt this does it.  Recommend for price.  If looking for quality look at higher priced kilts<br /><br />Looks cool.  Plan to wear out to a bar with my Scotland t-shirt and hiking boots under the kilt."
4.0,It's ok but my boobs are continuously almost getting out of the top part.
4.0,nice durable
4.0,I got the white dress and It is very see through.
4.0,the zipper do not stay zipped and it is a small  fit for the size
4.0,"The watch looked really elegant and it seems well built but it was really hard to take out the pins to change the size, it looked like the pins where rusty but over all love the watch"
4.0,"I was skeptical when reviewing the sizing at first... the generic chart said my 2.5 year old was a 3T but the description sizing looked much, much larger. I ultimately went with his normal sizing, 2T and it fit perfectly. Overall, the quality is great. Slightly thicker cotton than his standard tee shirts, cute design, feels durable. My only complaint is the stitching which seemed a little sloppy and caused some loose threads. Other than that, great. Would definitely buy again."
4.0,"I ordered the size L and M and the large fit me.  I chose the pink shade but in my opinion it is a peachy pink shade. Furthermore, I normally wear a size 8 in a dress and am 5'8 143 and 36b bust line.  This is a pretty feminine dress but if you are big busted don't order it as it will be tight in that area.  It is designed for small framed women with smaller chests.  It looks exactly as pictured.  A feature I like is the ruffle that falls over the bust, I do not need to wear a bra with it because it gives the coverage needed."
4.0,My daughter loved them! But when they &#34;oink&#34; you can't hear it very good.
4.0,"I really love this dress! Has lots of stretch, love the side pockets. Cheap belt won't stay slides off with movement. I wore a petticoat. Fun dress, you can dress it up with white or red shoes, belt.  I had it dry clean because I couldn't take out the wrinkles. And the neck line is not the same as pictured. I had them sew the collar to stay in place. Note if you are going to attempt to iron make sure your iron is on correct low setting as this material burns easily."
4.0,It's a little longer than your bra. I.think it should have been a little longer ..
4.0,"This dress is so cute! I expected more of a tea length dress based on the images.. but coming in at 5’4 it’s not unusual for dresses to be longer on me! It’s still a good length. It is slightly on the thin side, but I still love it. My only wish is that it had pockets!!"
4.0,Totally satisfied thank you so much.
4.0,"For the price the item seems pretty good quality. It as everyone else has stated comes highly wrinkled, I have not tried smoothing it yet, when I do I will try a hand held steamer or iron idk. The wrinkling is thus far the only thing I can be negative about but I have only tried it on and looked for a short amount of time at it.<br /><br />The size for me is excellent, I am 6'0""-6'2"", 160lbs and I got the M(US 38). If you are of similar weight and height you can get that size with confidence I think.<br /><br />Undershirts with a design can be seen through the jacket slightly but that in my opinion is kind-of to be expected and is not at all something I would remove a star for. It is 'linen' and lightweight after all."
4.0,I think this would look better on someone who is petite. It just didn’t work on me.
4.0,"These are very lovely and the quality is very good; but  having said that, the reviews that say that the wires are thicker than most are absolutely correct.  They hurt my ears and I am unable to wear them for very long which is why I did not give them 5 stars.  They came well packaged and right on time.  I would love to get other colors of these but won't.  I don't know why anyone would create such lovely earrings but with wires that won't go in ear holes that most people have.  If you have stretched out ear holes, these are for you."
4.0,"This leotard is a nice quality and a pretty color.  It would have been perfect except it runs really small.  My daughter wears a size 8, and we had to return it and get a bigger size."
4.0,"I liked this top overall. The material is a little thin, and my one fault with it is that if you are wearing bottoms of any type where the material around the button or snap above the zipper sticks out a little, that “stick out” point will show through at the waist.  I have another of these in the dusty rose color, which is a very nice color. With the lighter color, the stick out point is more noticeable than my second of this top in maroon. Other than that, it is light, cool, and fits loosely, but on me, not baggy. I’m 68, pear shaped, 5’4, 139 lbs, 38” bust. The medium fits me well."
4.0,"A lot larger than expected. Looks ok, fast shipping"
4.0,"Perfect modest swimsuit.  I'm 5'4"" and 150 lbs and Large fit great.  The suit has a relaxed top that hides the tummy perfectly.  The bottoms are unlined, but the pattern hides everything.  The top also has pads which can be removed."
4.0,I have DD breast. This suit was not made for DD. But if you are not doing anything strenous except lounging around- this will be perfect. I rec'd a lot of compliments. But be careful you will end up unintentially flashing someone.
4.0,Good price for .3 hats can’t complain. Not recommended for people with big head like me
4.0,"Not the best quality tie clip you'll ever see, but my dad loved it to wear on the day of my wedding!"
4.0,"Comfortable, stylish and a bit sexy. I like this dress. Wore it on a city boat ride and it was great for the occasion,"
4.0,"** UPDATE**<br />The previous review applies, however the material is less see through.<br /><br />I ordered a size down I normally wear a size large but got a medium and could have very easily worn a small.<br /><br />worn with: - https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B0149X7C0O/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1 (NOT AVAILABLE)<br /><br />PREVIOUS REVIEW<br />See through. Very very light weight material. You will see every jiggle and roll. The color was pretty the length was good."
4.0,"I get a lot of complements on this dress and after several times through the was it is still holding up well.  The fit is very flattering, however the bow did not stay on."
4.0,"I wasn't sure what to expect, given the spotty reviews, but I'm glad I took the plunge (pun intended).  For one, it's cheap.  And for the price it's well constructed.  I love the top.  The thing I don't like about it is that, despite it being the largest size they offer (XL), the bottoms still dug into my side chunk a bit...which isn't my favorite thing.  It's still cute, and maybe it'll motivate me to work out more, ha!  It's NOT the same swim suit on the models in the pictures... but it IS the same suit in the top photo.  The girls are wearing something different.  The suit is pretty true to the size chart - it runs very small.  Like I said, I bought the XL, and I have attached photos."
4.0,"This is my Caturday shirt for work and I've received a TON of compliments on it. It's a nice quality without being too thick and bulky. Most importantly, it didn't shrink when I washed it."
4.0,The zipper was cheap.... it keep unzipping.<br /><br />Thats the only issue
4.0,"Lightweight, soft material"
4.0,"Looks great and fits my boyfriend great, but the fabric material feels cheap. We wash them inside out and hang dry because they feel like they might unthread easy."
4.0,This top was a good fit for me.
4.0,That work great for my night driving. They are a little big over my glasses but do stay on.
4.0,Ordered 38DD and I barely fit in it on the last clasp! Other than that it is a fantastic sports bra.
4.0,This is a cute slip dress. The material is like a thin rayon but not see through. What gives this dress style is the top with the ruffles and bunched straps. It dips low in the back so you can’t wear a bra with it - I tried the stick up stuff but it’s pretty low cut so you could still see the sticky part at the top. I’m a 38C but I wouldn’t recommend this dress for anyone larger than maybe a D cup. Length is top of knee. It’s a cool dress for the summer.
4.0,"Very cute and comfy. The only reason for the four stars instead of five, is that part of the hem wasn’t sewed when I got it. But it was easily fixed. Would buy again."
4.0,I’m pretty petit (5’1) and length wise it’s a great knee length dress. The top of the dress is what fits very loosely the rest it great. Wore this to a work Christmas party and got lots of compliments.
4.0,I REALLY ENJOY THESE EARRINGS AND WEAR THEM EVERYWHERE. I WILL DEFINATELY BUY FROM THIS COMPANY AGAIN AND AGAIN. THANK YOU FOR A LOVELY PRODUCT.
4.0,"I bot this primarily to use as a mask. Unfortunately, it does not work well for that. It was to loose and kept sliding off my face. I tried doubling it hoping that would make it titer on my face but that didn’t work either. I tried buying hair clips to clip the fabric in the back to make it titer. That helped a little, but it eventually slipped anyway. The only time it stayed in place is if I didn’t move or talk. This item worked well fore the other ways it can be worn, but not as a mask. I will have to find something else for that."
4.0,"This is a great sandal, but it's been too cold in VT to wear them consistently. Great support for my very flat feet though and plenty wide for my Flinstone-esque foot shape."
4.0,"The sleeves are beautiful but the material is somewhat sheer. I just wish it was a little longer, I'm assuming this is meant to be worn with high waisted bottoms."
4.0,It works really good and looks pretty
4.0,"Bought a pair of these to accessorize a Halloween costume, they are exactly as you'd expect and seem to be well made."
4.0,The item was what I expected just came 4 days later than expected for a birthday gift. Also it is insulated!
4.0,Many compliments on how this tie looks
4.0,"Nice piece, it's really ok for the money. Doesn't look as good as in the picture once you have it."
4.0,It's pretty and I like the movement of the fringe. It doesn't cover much but it's cute. The elastic waist band is a plus
4.0,I bought it for my mother . She loved it. I love the color too.
4.0,"Bought this for a relative. Fit adult and teenage heads. Kept relative warm however, it was a little thin. Very light weight and cute."
4.0,"Somewhat thin,but good."
4.0,Very nice jewelry set get a lot of compliments on it. I am pleased with my purchase
4.0,"Smaller than I expected, but very nice."
4.0,"Used this product for a party. Kids loved it. However, took 1 star off because some made noise others didn't. Also, free of the putty was dry"
4.0,This top is cute but cheap. I like it though!
4.0,"I got a lg it was way to big,it dose look like the pic."
4.0,Very light weight.  Ordered a L but was sent a M.  It's actually a bit loose so I'm glad for the mixup.  Lol. Size seems true to size...I've just been losing weight after having Baby. (Husband's acct).  Didn't realize this was Nike.  Idk how I missed that.  Thought it would be good for evening outings but it won't work for my style with the nike logo.  Keeping it though bc it Does work for my daytime gear.
4.0,"But well worth the effort, nice looking and flattering<br />Wish they would make this and more in silver"
4.0,"Pretty dress at a great price. The only issue l’ve had is if it gets even a drop of water on it, it leaves a faded spot on the dress. I washed it before I wore it, so I’m not sure why it’s having this issue."
4.0,Ran small even though I ordered a larger  size. Too short and I am not tall
4.0,"Judging by the product photo, this top is supposed to be part of a set of pajamas. That's okay, the top is fine on its own.<br /><br />It fits just a little on the small side. I usually wear a large or medium and the large is a little snug. Because the fabric is thin, it gets a little thinner when it stretches. I still felt comfortable wearing the top in public. It is very cute!<br /><br />I like the embroidered star design. The length is good to wear tucked or not. It is a nice top for warm weather wear."
4.0,It's a good deal
4.0,Actually bought this for my 70ish mother.  She loves it and so do I!
4.0,"I'm a big fan of these sunglasses. They're lightweight and polarized, so they block out the glare of sunlight and let me see much better when driving. The design is simple, classic, and looks nice on my face. The lenses don't have any weird reflections that make it hard to see with them on.<br /><br />I'd say they're a good choice if you want something nicer than off the carousel at a drug store, but don't want to go any higher in price than this is probably the choice for you."
4.0,Nice coat. Runs long but nice
4.0,Perfect suit for doing laps. Ran somewhat smaller than I thought but it gets the job done.
4.0,This ring lasted for quite some time considering how inexpensive it was and  I wore it everyday (took it off for showers). Eventually it lost a few stones that seemed to be glued together in a strip.
4.0,Well made but the bag looks bigger than the amount I pack.
4.0,"These aren't too tight around the ankles which I love. No idea how well they'll hold up but they were pretty affordable so if I get a winter out of them the purchase will be worth it. Note that you'll get a random color selection, so if you want a specific color you might not get it. I got gray, gray, and black which is fine but not what I thought I was ordering."
4.0,"Love this guitar necklace! The guitar is detailed and looks just like a Gibson Les Paul! It looks really nice to wear. I rated this as 4 stars because i have one concern. The gold necklace itself seems really fragile. It is a thin necklace and it is hard to put on. You ave to be careful when you put the necklace on because the chain might break. The guitar itself is beautiful, but the chain seems fragile. Mine didn't break yet. You could always change the chain anyways. I still recommend this product for any guitar lover/music lover. Gorgeous piece."
4.0,I got them today...not quite as tall as I wanted them...darn it! But they are warm.
4.0,Don't twirl in your hands. They are somewhat delicate but if you are careful they are great. Nice small container for travel.
4.0,"Cute dress, fit me well but I wasn't crazy about the print in person."
4.0,Ok for it's price
4.0,tried it out for 4th of July and SUCCESS!!
4.0,"i bought these just for a casual little earring, and that they are. they're very small. but they dont get in the way like larger earring can. they also turn my ear holes (haha not the whole ear) black after i've worn them all day and take them out. But its not like they cost a lot so i didn't expect white gold or anything. they're cute and i'm happy enough with them."
4.0,Nice but looks more like a shirt instead of dress
4.0,Loved it. It is a cream color. It was a Little shorter then the other one I have so I had to keep fixing it
4.0,"I'm a true size 8 medium so I knew these would be snug because of the XS-M sizing,  But they do fit, are comfortable & are really inexpensive so I'm pleased."
4.0,"This shirt is super cute! I ordered a small, and I am 135lbs, 5'7. I have an athletic build, and I think the shirt was a little loose, but still comfortable! It's super soft and fits great!"
4.0,"Love the feel, not too hot or tight, which allowed them to slide down a few times a shift."
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:79f530bc750c697cda2a2bae4f8c9816]] It would of been perfect but my daughter needed a little more space in the rear of the pants. Video came out great though, Thanks"
4.0,Material is sort of stiff but nice top. Fit is good.
4.0,"Though lightweight, the jersey material definitely holds warmth. It's a cute color, and easy to wash and wear."
4.0,smelled funny but otherwise cute!
4.0,"Overall, I like this top.  It is cute and comfy.  It isn't as thick and warm as I was hoping."
4.0,I wore this to look classy at a beach outing but still relaxed aloha style. This shirt did the job! It definitely fits smaller that's why I got a size larger and it fits perfectly. Once they get the sizing right it would be a amazing product
4.0,"It is a lovely belt, works well for what I need it for.  But I did have to pull a section of it apart and rethread the leather through the chain links as it came to me messed up and turned around."
4.0,It is beautiful as the picture but it is very big so I had to take out a lot of links in it. It fits great now and I like that it is light weight so it doesn't feel heavy after having it on for a long time! I never got the free gift with it.
4.0,"They arrived slightly bent in terms of the overall shape (not sure if it was a manufacturing issue), but they were pretty easy to bend into the proper shape. They work, and look ok."
4.0,My son has had this for about 6 months. Great watch for kids. Durable. Just keep the instructions on how to change date/time.
4.0,"Very soft and shiny.  I love the ruffles along the arm.  My fingertips and nails had a bit of black on them after a night of dancing with the gloves on, but it washed off.  All in all, a satisfactory purchase."
4.0,"Simple, flattering fit dress. Can be dressed up or down for work or an event."
4.0,"I was a bit surprised how &#34;stripperish&#34;, besides that they have a great pouch that keeps everything in, it feels like you are wearing nothing... I would recommend them if you are looking for breathable, barely there underwear."
4.0,This shrug is heavier than others I've purchased.  Good for fall and winter
4.0,"Really cute and comfy nightgown. This is fleece, not jersey as the description says."
4.0,Kinda love it but is very small..order next size up..I may re-order for myself.
4.0,"bought this as a gift, I'm sure the person i give them too will love them"
4.0,"While this does not provide high impact support as its description indicated, it is very comfortable for medium to light activities."
4.0,"This is definitely a cute romper I ordered it in white however it was way too big order your size or a size down my measurements are 34 DD waist 29 hips 40 I ordered a large and it was too big. I ordered a size up based on reviews I would order a medium or a small if they had my size in stock , This romper  has a slight stretch to it not a lot but enough to get over your curves!! such a cute romper so mad they don't have my size anymore I would definitely recommend it just make sure you get your regular size."
4.0,"Bought as a gift for my daugher.  She loved it, but even as a size 6 it fit her snuggly.  The girl in the photo must be pretty tiny to have it drape on her body as shown."
4.0,I like it a lot but it you want to have some room by one size larger. I am 6&#34; 210 and it is snug in a xl.
4.0,They are really comfortable but the legs are really tight. I'm a small so I thought the medium would be nice to lounge around in but even for me the legs are tight. They are now a really comfortable pair of lounging shorts and I ordered another pair.  I went with XL. I figured since they were ecko they'd be baggy but aren't so make sure u order up.
4.0,"Great shirt, daughter LOVED it. Runs slightly big"
4.0,"Nice and light, looks great on."
4.0,my girlfriend bought  this blouse she says is beautiful  but  tight in the shoulders.
4.0,"Being larger chested (unfortunately) very difficult to find a supportive, comfortable, SEAMLESS bra . Cups sizes seem to run a touch small. Band size true to size.  Wanted a strapless bra as wear a few off the shoulder and boatneck blouses and also wanted the adjustable criss cross straps for extra support for daily wear. There are 2 different placement spots on the back & front to customise fit. The silicone doesn't bother me at all & I love the pretty black floral jacquard fabric. It does stay up, however the only complaint I have is that the bottom rolls up a bit. It is bandless but there is a little extra material under the wires that could be done without I'm sure.  There is side boning, of course, but it doesn't dig under my arm & I'm only 5'3. Overall happy with purchase."
4.0,Soft warm nicely made for the price.<br />You need to wash it a couple of times when you first receive it or you'll get fuzz all over things.
4.0,Item arrived as described. Nice darker lenses.
4.0,Love the pattern but had to return due to size. I'm normally a 7 but they were a half size too big. Had to return and get a 6.5
4.0,I should have orderd an cl to hv that looser feel. But a beautiful dress
4.0,"I love this hoodie so much. It's lightweight & super comfortable. I love that it has pockets & the lettering feels like it's pretty durable. I used the sizing chart, taking into account that I'd be wearing clothes underneath & it fits perfectly. The only downside is that it's so thin I can't wear it by itself in the winter, I have to wear a bigger coat over it & then you can't see it, but when warmer weather comes I will definitely be wearing it as much as possible!"
4.0,"I received this bracelet from the manufacturer at no cost for evaluation, and here are my thoughts.<br /><br />This is an adorably whimsical bracelet that features sparkling sapphire blue cubic zirconia stones and silvery moons along a 6.5&quot; chain with a sturdy lobster claw clasp and a 1&quot; extender. Made entirely of hypoallergenic 925 Sterling Silver that's been plated with Rhodium so it will never tarnish, the bracelet has four 6mm size blue sapphire colored zirconia stones and three smaller clear diamond-like cubic zirconia stones that are prong set onto the larger moons for a total of seven stones in all.<br /><br />The brilliant sparkle of the cubic zirconia stones is beautifully balanced by the shimmering silver moons, and because of the flat backs the bracelet lays nicely without twisting when worn. The silver chain links connecting stones to moons are delicate enough to look nice yet also sturdy, and the lobster claw clasp is large enough that I can fasten the bracelet without assistance. I have average size wrists, and the bracelet fit me without needing to use the extender, but that extra inch the extender offers should make this bracelet long enough to fit most wrists.<br /><br />Overall, this bracelet is feminine, whimsical, fun, and affordably priced. It's cute enough to be worn by grown up women or teenage girls, and it looks good with casual outfits."
4.0,"This wallet is nice.<br /><br />The material is good, it is very compact, and the cash magnet is a balanced strength. Only thing that's not so great is the side card pockets are a little tight. I would buy it again though."
4.0,"I injured myself when trying to remove them stubborn links but managed to make it work after some blood and sweat. An arrow marking the direction of the pin removal might have helped, but I am not sure if this is designed like that since the pin looks the same on both ends to me.<br /><br />I like the wood feel and look and have been getting compliments, but the plastic feels awful to touch and does not look convincingly like glass to my eye.<br /><br />I will be wearing it here and there."
4.0,Lindo y cómodo
4.0,"As advertised, suits me fine."
4.0,"Great quality, nice features, Fast delivery.!!"
4.0,I found this product to be good.  I had a few ballpoint ink stains on a suede handbag and after using this product it did remove it.  It also cleaned some other stains that are on the purse from everyday wear.  I would recommend it.
4.0,"My daughter loves it :) . However we had to fix it a few times, which is expected for the price."
4.0,This is a really cute dress but I wear a size 14 and have C+ cup size. The waist came up too high. There are pockets on both sides and they pulled open. I will probably return this one and order in a size 16.
4.0,It is a solid and durable bag and will work well for what it is being gifted for. The material looks slightly different than in the picture.
4.0,My boys love these. Just be cautious when washing the adjuster will come off of the ear straps.
4.0,My mom love the Sherlock Holmes look
4.0,"Order for my husband since he wants a pair of ""sporty sandal that can cover his toes"". Not so sure if I want to spend over $70 on Keens, so I bought this for him. The first thing he said was ""ugh... is it girl's sandal?"" I laughed. But the more I look at it, the more I agree with him. So now he wears them to mow the lawn (and that's about it). Eventually I invested in Keens for his Father's Day gift. Don't get me wrong, it is a pair of comfortable shoes (only a little bit tight at small toes area). Just make sure you like the design before you buy it - maybe a trip to store taking a real look at it?!"
4.0,"I choose the gold set since it seemed the most neutral combo. They are stretchy, individual bracelets and fit my wrist (6” around) well, but are not loose. These may not be comfortable if your wrist is much bigger. I am happy with the quality. The varied detail of the beading make the set interesting. The tassels and other charms are trendy right now! Since they are separate bracelets you can wear a few or all of them!"
4.0,Very faltering and comfortable. The fabric is not too thin. Got several compliments.
4.0,Bought these to replace the ones I bought in Guatemala. They look great
4.0,There is nothing wrong all fits perfect
4.0,"Red Cord became undone, had to glue it a few times"
4.0,"Good quality, it fit but no free space to move ( small ) for me."
4.0,Nice purse for the price
4.0,Bought it for my wife and it looks cute.
4.0,"This dress is very cute! Huge downside for me is this is hand wash only, no dryer either. Very cute designs, I'm 6'1 so this was little shorter on me then the model in picture. It can be dressy or more casual with leggings maybe. V-neck wrap with cinch waist tie. 100% Polyester. The collarless vneck is a subdued design with highlights such as the cinch tied.. V-neck, short sleeve, faux wrap dress. Hand wash, no washing machine or dryer. I prefer different design of this dress, than the polka dots. Certainly cute and flattering. Quality garment. Would purchase from this manufacturer again for sure"
4.0,This necklace makes such a nice gift... I bought ours for my sister in law.. I wanted something special that would not just be your average fashion jewelry but would also be affordable.. this worked out well ... the necklace itself is a lovely gold .. the pendant lies flat to your chest... the chain is delicate... definitely a gift for an older child or any lady young at heart...I love the fact that a donation is made with every purchase.. .it makes the gift even more special...
4.0,"I got two - black and burgundy. They arrived within a week. They did not bleed while washing and they are decent quality. However, there's no tag indicating what they are made of."
4.0,This is a good quality T-shirt that’s fit to size. The item arrived on time and was well packaged. I will update my review after a couple of washes.
4.0,"These phone holders for the Xbox One controllers are great!  ...and a great value.  4 stars instead of 5 is a little grip about the design, would like to be able to have access to the controller sync button with having to take the holder off first.  Otherwise, holder is sturdy and well constructed."
4.0,"This skirt fits well and is very comfortable but if you have large upper thighs or saddlebags, the cut of this skirt will make them more pronounced. I loved how comfortable this skirt is so ended taking in the sides so the flare wasn't so pronounced thus solving the problem."
4.0,its very well done
4.0,"Use these at work (12 hr warehouse shifts).  They stay in place pretty well and keep my hair and sweat out of my eyes.  They are also in a bunch of different colors, so I can coordinate them with most of my outfits.  I machine wash mine with the rest of my clothes too, so easy peasy."
4.0,I'm impressed. The look and feel is great. I particularly like the clasp.
4.0,"Looked great. I was worried becuase it didn't cost much at all. I was compliments at work. They couldn't believe it was from amazon and it's held up to hand washing.  I'm too heavy so it is more fitted in the chest but going up a size would be too big everywhere else since it is more A line shaped. Great length on me as well and I'm u see 5'5"""
4.0,A little daintier than I was hoping for but I love it just the same. I just hope the chain doesn’t break!!
4.0,Nice design an material
4.0,Perfect for what i was looking for in a spring and fall jacket
4.0,"The price was right. The background is a pretty, shimmery blue-silver. The chain is made of several strands of black jewelry &#34;wire.&#34;  It's ok, but makes the piece more casual than if it had been partnered with a silver chain. Also, the black wire bends/holds kinks, and mine has a strand with a part that is thicker than the rest in a visible area (not by the back clasp), which I don't like. It's an obvious imperfection.<br />However, I will emphasize that for the price, I am really pleased with the pendant itself. It's smaller in size than a quarter, maybe a bit bigger than a nickel."
4.0,"I had trouble with knee injury for many years, these shoes sort of force my knees into alignment, I still have to be careful but I don't have the nagging pain I had."
4.0,My math teacher husband loves it.
4.0,Love adidas and these were on sale. My granddaughter loved them for school. They were a bit big on her but that is because I ordered them that way.
4.0,I love the dress but sadly i had to return it. I feel like im between the medium and large size. Its so soft and pretty but just didn't fit me right.
4.0,"I purchased these to wear in the wintertime when I get a pedi-cure.  One always feels silly wearing flip flops in December however; with these on, I feel better and the rest of my foot stays warm.  Since they have individual toes, they separate the toes perfectly so, no need for separators.  Enjoy!"
4.0,Boys loved these!
4.0,Nice belt. The only drawback is that the ratchet release button sticks sometimes making it a little difficult to loosen
4.0,Good material.. its a wrap skirt
4.0,They work great but the logo is at the top of the sock so I hate wearing it with flats.. which is all I wear.
4.0,🆗
4.0,Keeps me very warm on cold Maine days!!
4.0,a little stiff so my feet slide around if im in socks but super soft.
4.0,It is warm. Fits well and my ponytail fits through the opening
4.0,"Read the size chart carefully. Weight of the spandex fabric is nice. Not too heavy and not too thin. Non clingy skirt yet heavy spandex top.  Nice work casual, style can easily be dressed up or down. Does require ironing to look best. If you’re someone who hates to iron, then this is not the dress you want"
4.0,"Material thinner than expected, but attractive design."
4.0,"When I am old I will wear purple. Nice dress! Fits well, love the pockets, washes easily. And the price was right!"
4.0,The graphics are awesome. It could have been a few inches longer.
4.0,Went beautifully with my daughter's prom dress. Just the accent she needed.
4.0,"Nice earings, just the lever back seem flimsy."
4.0,"My granddaughter loves her Marsha and Bear shirt.  Its a little lighter material than I expected, its more of shirt material not sweatshirt but it does say ""shirt"" in description so it is as described.  The image looks great.  Not sure yet how it holds up with laundry.  The pink color is a very nice tone of pink."
4.0,The silver looks better than the gold. The gold can look a little cheap. but overall they are very cute and i get compliments every time.
4.0,The watch itself is very nice for how inexpensive it is. The band is ok.  I took it off and placed it on a nato strap and I like it even more.
4.0,"The color and the material were both fine, I just have a slender build so the sleeves in the medium were to short for me."
4.0,"Wife bought for period week and wrote this review to husband's horror: They fit great and are comfortable, but pads do not stick to them. Not recommended for period week, but great otherwise.<br /><br />(Sorry, hubby! Ladies NEED to know this!)"
4.0,"I’ve only used it once so far, when I was cutting styrofoam. It always smells so bad that a regular mask can barely block the smell. This mask blocks the smell a little more. Seems sturdy and made of durable material. So far, so good. Hopefully, it will hold its shape overtime."
4.0,"Runs a tad small, but is very forgiving since it's a wrap. Ladies with a large chest will have to wear a cami under it. Top is lined, but lining is very short, and fabric is shear. Love the shape and print though!"
4.0,Christmas and had a blast entertaining
4.0,Pretty bag.
4.0,I love this shirt. It’s so soft and has a good weight to it. However from reading reviews I ordered a size up from my normal size. I don’t suggest that. Also I wish the tan was actually tan/camel color like the photo. It is not its flesh color. (Looks tan in regular photo but when I color adjust it shows the actual color ie. picture #1).
4.0,I order other colors in the dress but then the green one fitted smaller.I was disappointed because that’s the one that I really wanted to work.But all the other dresses are great.I brought a 3x
4.0,Love having pockets on leggings! Not squat-proof.
4.0,"These flip-up sunglasses are well-built and securely clip onto my regular eyeglasses. The flip-up detent system, which locks the glasses into the desired position, consists of springs bearing against a notched rod. It is effective but may be subject to wear over time."
4.0,Sparkling bracelet and earrings. Perfect for a special occasion.
4.0,This is my third suit from ReliBeauty.  The fit is great (love the pads for extra coverage) and the price is great!  I swim 4 times a week so these suits get exposed to chlorine water a lot. Color holds up well - but the suits stretched out after about 3 months of constant wear .  Considering the price I think thats not bad .  Speedo brand suits from Costco wore out quicker than these! The style is great for lap swimming too.  I will continue to buy them!
4.0,"I like it, but you definitely need the petticoat which I do have on under this one. I wear 8/10 and order the medium one and it fits fine. A little snug in the breast."
4.0,"don't like the pouch for your private parts would have preferred that to not be there ,"
4.0,I’m 5’3” and 150 lbs. it’s a tad loose at the bottom half. Thank goodness for that belt sash because it’s boxy and extremely loose at the waist.
4.0,"I like the bag really! The color is very nice and exactly as seen in the picture. Just the holders could be little wide and bigger, but that is a very nice bag!"
4.0,The socks were very comfortable just the wrong shade of blue
4.0,Stone popped out. it won't happen again. I super glued it.
4.0,"All in all a good Tent. Used it by the sea.<br />Wish this was cheaper. Sierra tents are not cheap. They are good though. Another thing. I wish they would make tents to stand the test of time. That means washing machine washable, sunproof etc. A tent that doesn't need to be treated with kid's gloves."
4.0,Cute pulls actual clasp is funk and they don’t lie flat
4.0,"This dress is so simple and it feels really soft, so it’s really nice to wear. It is a little bit bigger, probably because of the material, but I like it. Allows me to cover my legs with my dress if it gets too cold! Would recommend!"
4.0,I used this product on cold days over my pants.  It kept my legs warm.
4.0,"great looking watch, the reason it doesn't get 5 stars is the buckle part of it feels flimsy compared to every other g shock I have. It feels like its going to break any sec and flaps around. All my other g shocks the buckle feels solid."
4.0,"These did not arrive in time for what we had purchased them for, but the seller was more than fair and provided a refund for the product as soon as they were notified of the delivery delay.<br /><br />The lights did not come individually packaged, they were all (120 of them because we purchased 3 orders) in a plastic bag and had spilled in the box.<br /><br />For the price they're great and kids love lights.  Also great for other uses."
4.0,They look great. They are too big for my head. The ear curve is about an inch past my ear.
4.0,"The arms fit a little strange, and the belt loops need to be moved down a touch, but those are easily overlooked because this print is adorable."
4.0,"I fell in love with this outfit but when it was delivered and I tried it on, it was too big. I'm 5ft 7"" and 160lbs. I should have ordered one size down instead."
4.0,"For the price, you can't beat it.<br />Very cool looking.<br />I changed the bands and it still sexy!.<br />Although the dials don't work for me, everything else seems nice."
4.0,"It's just a belt, after all, but good quality for the price and quite solid in construction."
4.0,Great for school days. Worn in the rain and cold. Muddy days on playground not so much.
4.0,Nice hat. Not my style.
4.0,The sandal looks great and is very comfortable to walk in but the strap runs a little large; they were just a little loose on my feet.
4.0,I bought 2 of these as gifts for little girls and they look great!  I can't believe how nice they are for the price!  I would recommend purchasing!
4.0,It is quite a cute little sloth. The back of it has odd air bubbles but still worth the price.
4.0,"These are nice, light-weight men's low cut socks.  These would be nice to wear in warmer weather in loafers, tennis shoes, etc...  They are well knitted, are a coffee bean brown color and washed well in the regular laundry cycle.  I didn't notice any fading - maybe a little shrinking but not much after getting them out of the dryer."
4.0,Purchased these to keep my feet warm while working from home.  They are comfortable.  They should come with a warning to wash separately as they fuzzed up my entire load.
4.0,Really lovely I am a big Chanel fan...it was a great faux look
4.0,Skrinks and seems to change texture when you was it.
4.0,"I like this product! It fit me exactly the way I had hoped it too, I don't know my exact measurements but I'm about 5'3&#34; and 116 lbs if that helps. I think it would fit anyone who is size 0-2 possibly 3. It does feel a little cheap but it looks nice."
4.0,"Its not a cheap, thin material which I like and for the price was surprised. I am still waiting for spring to be able to wear it with white pants! Very soft and comfortable."
4.0,"Lovely, but difficult to fasten on."
4.0,The dress was very pretty and nice material. I really enjoyed it.
4.0,Super cute and has held up in multiple washings. Yeah the necklace is made out of cheap plastic but it is cute and hasn't broke and what do you expect for $10. I can't give 5 stars because the sleeves fit a bit odd and dig into my armpits.
4.0,This bag was beautiful! Perfect pink!
4.0,"These socks are nice, specially if you have the shirt that matches, but if your size is less than 10 they might be a little large but still wearable."
4.0,It fits as expected. Looks good but it’s inky been a week. More later.
4.0,Super Good
4.0,They are a little clunky looking in person but really comfortable
4.0,Very light and delicate - pretty. It is bigger than some other bracelets that say they are the same size.
4.0,"As expected, will be the go to robe for years. Thick and warm"
4.0,Snug fit; I fe;t there was better protection.
4.0,Only giving this 4 stars because they sent me the gray hat instead of the pink hat that I ordered. It’s not winter yet but the hat fits perfectly and the material is SO soft for my toddler! Fits great and I’m excited for her to wear it out & about without worry of it falling off/ her being cold.
4.0,"adorable, my daughter will grow into them - they run very large"
4.0,The material is not ribbed as I expected it to be and it is more slick like a satin. The dress fits great and it looked really nice on me.
4.0,"It's a very cute hat. Unfortunately, it fits my newborn too big. She probably wont fit into it until she's a toddler."
4.0,"Oversized as stated and Cute for the price! Got matching pairs for friends for VDay, everyone loved them. Blue is more like Teal. Picture is Pink “Gray” “Blue” and Green"
4.0,"These sweaters are so vibrant and fun! Soft and silky feel that can easily be dressed up during the work week, and dressed down with some jeans on the weekend. I wash them in cold water and hang them to dry and they have maintained their color, shape, and texture."
4.0,Super cute but the little ring that holds it on the big one isn’t very strong the peice keeps falling off.
4.0,Sleeves are to short for my taste
4.0,I bought this as a gift for my admin and she loves it.  Very simple & elegant
4.0,"I love the style of the dress, but the small was too small. I gave it to my daughter and it looked great on her, she is also taller and slimmer. I ordered a larger size and it fits pretty nicely. I am 5' and 146 lbs. It probably depends on where it all falls, lol."
4.0,I like the shorts but they run small. ALL other KanCan I have bought fit in the same size.
4.0,It fits as expected.  The boning is a little uncomfortable and needs a rubber lining to induce more sweat.  Sucks me in nicely tho.  Suits it's purpose.
4.0,I didnt like them after first wash. They just didnt look and feel the same on after that. I didn't dry them either.
4.0,Very cute/dainty. The gold shimmers in the light
4.0,Item was good and delivered in a timely matter.  Too bad the Fitbit quit working though!  I recommend the product!
4.0,I ordered based on rave reviews and Today show recommendation. They're way too small. I ordered a medium and it's like a extra small. ****so update I have increased my star rating after finally trying them on miraculously they fit and feel great. They sure looked small but apparently looks can be deceiving. My apologies.
4.0,"I got this bracelet to add a little flair to my spring and summer attire, however it's a tad smaller than I thought and takes a little effort to fasten. Other than that I love it"
4.0,larger that expected
4.0,My son loves this it was bought as a birthday present and he has yet to take it off.. Just don't sleep in it he did once and it messed up the netal parts at the end
4.0,"Nice looking and great for laps. I  am 5' 6 and 127# but long in the body, so it's a bit uncomfortable."
4.0,"Yes I would buy these again , Bought for Pandora bracelet , Fits & looks great"
4.0,Like the soft fabric and color.
4.0,"Nice looking dress ; very comfortable, soft fabric. It comes to just below my knee, but I expected this based on the information provided by other customers. Although I’m pleased with the dress, I do wish the sleeves had been a little looser as they’re almost too tight."
4.0,Very cute. No complaints. Looks as advertised.
4.0,I ordered my usual size and it fits great. Was a little upset with how thin the material is.
4.0,Really pretty. I am currently 3 1/2 months pregnant and really want to purchase clothes is can wear during and after baby. I wore this when I was not showing and it looked great. I got a ton of compliments. I would definitely recommend this dress!
4.0,"This dress was adorable, just a bit big on my small 7 year old.  I ordered a size 6 in the dress and we still had to tack it up so it didn't fall off her shoulders.  However, my daughter is pretty small.  I loved the color of the dress, the quality was great, just a bit large but I took care of that."
4.0,It is just fine
4.0,Love the colors and the cut. Bottoms are small cut as pictured
4.0,"Arrived bright and early exactly when they said it would!! Great design, fantastic quality. Fits large though, but looks amazing regardless. :)"
4.0,I bought this as a gift for my mother in law. The stones fell out. HOWEVER....the seller backed their product and took care of it under warranty with ZERO questions asked. She gets tons of compliments and loves it.
4.0,"These seem like an overall good sandal. They looked a little big at first but ended up fitting her well especially with the extra straps for security and support. This is more of a casual sandal or would even look nice with a sundress. My daughter likes them and this style sandal and no issues so far, so I'm happy with them."
4.0,"I love these bracelets, what a great gift or to keep for yourself."
4.0,Shamballa bracelet was purchased as a gift for a friend.  I thought it was great and hope that she did also.
4.0,"It's a nice shirt but runs small. Plus looks super trendy, way more than I thought. I don't think my husband will wear it."
4.0,"These gloves are gorgeous, soft and look just like the pictures. The only reason i have given 4 stars is that I only just received them and don't know how they will hold up. Hoping for the best because these are some pretty gloves!<br /><br />(For some reason the picture I posted makes the leather look creased and wrinkled, but in person they are smooth and soft!)"
4.0,"Bought it for my Mom as a gag gift! It was perfect for what I needed, it was large, wish it was V neck."
4.0,Small for a mans wrist
4.0,Exactly what I expected. It's comfortable and nice enough to wear out and about or just hanging around the house.
4.0,"This dress was beautiful.  However, it ran small.  I'm normally between a 14 & 16 and ordered an XL.  It was too small."
4.0,Completely satisfied with these glasses. Seemed cheaply constructed however they were exactly what I ordered so I can't complain.
4.0,Too big for size.
4.0,I was worried these would not fit so I bought a size up and they fit fine.
4.0,Looks just like the pic. Fits well. Im 5'7 130 lbs
4.0,Took some stretching to make them as comfortable as I like.  They seemed cut a bit tight.  I usually wear 8.5 W in regular shoes.  A couple days with shoe stretchers on warm sunny window sill and couple hours of wear made them much better.  Pretty lightweight and nice looking enough to wear when company visits or to head out for he paper if it's dry out.
4.0,For an inexpensive fashion boot the quality is very good.  There was an extra pair of heel caps included as an extra bonus.
4.0,Love all the colors but it is hard to get the ball back on when you put it in the piercing
4.0,Love this shirt but size up one size as it fits tighter than normal..
4.0,"These are a bit tight at the ankle/calf but still a good fit. Well made, these are comfortable, have a good length and overall good fit although the ankle is more snug than expected."
4.0,"Beautiful shoe design, subtle pink color is very delicate n pretty,, fabulous heel....sturdy chain ...perfect gift for a precious princess"
4.0,Looks great and fits like it should
4.0,"I ordered a size big based on reviews. However I realised it is better to stick to the size charts. Loved it! A bit thin in the material, but classy shirt none-the-less!"
4.0,Was stunning
4.0,Really doesn't slim you much though
4.0,I wear my Balaclava under my helmet on cold mornings works well !
4.0,"These pants are pretty great! They’re super comfortable - almost like pajama pants, but they’re also very chic and fashionable. The only reason I took a point off is because I think the material is a little too thin, but that could just be my personal taste!"
4.0,"Beautiful scarf! Only complaint is that it is not a bright white, but has somewhat of a tint."
4.0,Great deal for price.
4.0,Very close to the picture.....good value.
4.0,"Light weight, fits and washes well."
4.0,Good buy… The Jibbetz are made of good material and the images aren’t too bad either. My problem is that they are too big on my toddler crocs as shown in the pics. If they were a bit smaller then I’d give 5 stars.
4.0,Much nicer than anticipated based on price. Looks more like jewelry than a Fitbit
4.0,Happy with the shirt.  You will need an undershirt as the black is a bit see through.
4.0,Love the look and quality of this bag. I just wish there was a little more space inside so I could use it for weekend traveling. Size is more for daily use.
4.0,Es una buena camisa y esta muy bien para el precio. fué buena compra.
4.0,"I usually wear a size 12-14, so after reading reviews on this suit I decided to get a much larger size than what I usually would get. I was a little nervous but it fits pretty well! The top part is a little big so I'll just be careful it doesn't fall down while at the pool or safety pin it back tighter. Other than that, it's really cute!"
4.0,"These are very small, I normally where child size but these are a tight fit for both me and my daughter . Otherwise I really like them. It took some work to scrap the plastic off but I was able to get sparks from the firestarter."
4.0,Hiffyg
4.0,"Very cute dress, great material! I agree with some other reviews that it falls a bit oddly on shorter people (I’m 5’3”) but it looks so much better once you throw on a pair of heels, like a chunky heel sandal. Definitely looks odd with flats in my opinion. The other annoying thing is the tag that has the washing instructions, usually sewn to an inside seam, was sewn towards the bottom of the dress so you can see the tag due to the tulip style cut. It’s not the end of the world, you can take the tag out, but it’s that annoying paper one that gets the little pieces stuck around the thread. Overall great purchase!"
4.0,I bought a charcoal pair that are perfect. The black one are good too except they have a slightly more bootcut fit instead of straight. I like them better than Rekucci which I've been buying for years.
4.0,"I really wanted to give these huggie earrings five stars, but the flat, wide end of the post is annoying me so much.  When I’m putting the earrings on, the wideness is so hard to push through and I can feel my ear holes getting stretched over that bit.  Once they’re in, everything is fine and these are the cutest, funnest way to add sparkle to a simple, everyday outfit like a t-shirt and blue jeans.  They would be gorgeous, adorable “date at the State Fair” or “picnic in the park” earrings.<br /><br />But, wow, the manufacturer needs to work on the finishing because that flat bit just tears up my ears so bad it makes me not want to wear these. Like, I have lots of cute earrings that don’t torture me going in, so why should I?  I guess if your ear holes have been stretched or widened by wearing a lot of heavy or big-posted earrings already, you won’t have a problem, but I do.<br /><br />Also, the place were the post clips in at the back does not always feel secure.  It’s really hard to adjust it to a width where the post both goes in and feels like it is not going to pop out on its own.<br /><br />The takeaway is, these are super-cute earrings, but they have some technical issues."
4.0,"Nice bag, beautiful thick leather, bit small for files and a laptop,could do w a better shoulder strap"
4.0,"I'm glad I read the reviews because otherwise I never would have even bothered to purchase this dress.  I'm a 38G on top and I purchased the 2XL in dark blue.  The fit is very roomy.  I am 5'8&#34; with broad shoulders and a long torso above the waist and my upper body fills out the bodice so that the gathers don't reach my waist--it still looks nice as an empire waist. As an older woman, I would not inflict the sight of my wrinkly parts around the neck and shoulders on the public but it makes a wonderful dress for around the house and pool.  I I might wear it out with a wrap or cardigan.  I even sleep in it because it is so comfortable.  I love the fabric, which as the silky feel of viscose, but it is not durable and will snag, thus I deducted one star.  Wash in cold water and hang to dry for best results.  I hope this info is helpful for those concerned with fit."
4.0,This is a good quality nato with a nice fine weave and design. “Dressier” than the more rugged one I own. Singlepass is great so the watch doesn’t sit too high off the wrist and also always to place buckle and hardware under the wrist for a cleaner look. Price isn’t super cheap but reasonable. The buckle has that Tudor buckle look to it. Textile and weaving is nice. Hardware brushing is average.
4.0,"This necklace is exactly as advertised but I have it 4 stars because the little round disc part that is on the middle necklace strand does have some slight tarnish on one side of it. I am able to wear the necklace on the other side which fixes the dilemma but would prefer no tarnish.<br />The little vertical bar on the third chain is also quite flimsy and came very slightly bend but not noticeable and easily fixed.<br />The clasp is a lobster clasp and easily worked.<br />The color of the necklace is a nice, shiny gold and in my opinion this piece appears to be a nice quality.<br />This is not an item that could be worn everyday and never taken off as it would clearly tarnish bit for my purposes of wanting it to go with a few outfits every so often it is perfect!<br />I would recommend this product for price and quality."
4.0,Cute as hell. If you aren’t looking for an insulated boot or a steel toe it’s definitely worth the small price
4.0,They were a big large on me and I should have ordered a smaller size but they look fine nonetheless.  I like the quality of HUE leggings and will continue to wear them. Thank you!
4.0,The small band is not the same as the Fitbit band. But I love the color and I get lots of compliments!
4.0,"The clips on the back were facing the wrong way so of you put them on the bears would be on the wrong sides, but other than that great product and easy to fix if need be."
4.0,Only worn once and no issues so far.
4.0,Love this jumper!
4.0,"This tunic is lovely to wear, the fabric is very stretchy, but retains its shape. Only one ding, and that is the tie die pattern on the front makes two large round target shapes right across the ta-ta's (!!), so I won't wear this without a long scarf or vest. Other than that, the fit and shape are perfect."
4.0,Nice!! 😁
4.0,They were a gift and I'm told they're perfect.
4.0,Cool bracelet. One star off as clasp is tiny and hard for one hand to manipulate.
4.0,"This dress is extremely flattering for a woman with no hips. It gives the illusion of a slimmer waist and fuller hips. The straps are a little funky though, they don't quite sit correctly on me. I think I'll have to size to size down."
4.0,Stylish sun shades for a great price.
4.0,I really love this trench coat. It is thin and only for the rain or light cold but I was aware of that before I purchased it. It seems to run small and the sleeves are a bit short. No worries.  I'm going to add some black material to extend the sleeves and gather it like the back of the corset coat and it will be smashing.  I also removed the plastic buttons and replaced them with silver Victorian style buttons. Just a couple of tweaks and this coat will be incredible.
4.0,"Very pretty. But doesn't look real, blue stone wiggles quite a bit, and is pretty scratchy. Again it is very pretty though."
4.0,They ran small so I had to exchange them for a size up wondering to work with! I take a little girls size 14/16 so I thought a size XS would work had to reorder a Small but amazing to work with great company
4.0,I got this lanyard a while back obviously to support Atl utd. Not much to say. Got the product but it seems to be a bit cheap. The plastic and stitching just looks a bit off.
4.0,"Love the pendant, but lobster claw on chain use broken. I just used some leather lace in place of chain. I actually like that look better."
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:d015e6e05098d2f3520ef065a7effe19]] For the price they are fine. Nothing ultra amazing. Feel more like tights but seem squat proof so far. I’m 5’9 and 153lbs and got a large. The waist band is kinda big, a medium would have fit too. If you have a little waist be wary. Good enough. I’ll keep them. I like the color."
4.0,"These are very nice but you should size down. I ordered a medium but there’s no great compression, and I think that the fabric is very thin,  I think the Panty line is visible"
4.0,"The color is a little off in comparison to the photos online. I like the design overall and it appears to be well made. The color difference is my only complaint, I would've preferred the color seen in the photo."
4.0,"This is cute !  I have several of these tops and they are great for summer - they are light, short but not cropped and flattering. I don’t have enormous breasts so not sure how it would look if I did but for your average B/C cup this is cute."
4.0,"lovely material, is a size smaller then what I ordered."
4.0,"The Jeff & Aimy Head Wrap is very useful. It is cute, well made, and the fabric is extremely soft. It runs just a slight bit large. It doesn't use compression to hold the hair like some hairbands, but uses width instead. In fact, the product name aptly calls it a turban - it is almost that wide. Consequently, it COMPLETELY holds my hair off my face, something that no headband can ever do. The gray color is a good neutral. It's great to use during grooming, while running errands with ""gym hair,"" or just for around-the-house comfort."
4.0,Beautiful and well made. Fits as expected.
4.0,A very light gray love the options of the different straps
4.0,"Quick facts:<br /><br />-The loupe is decent for my purposes (party favors for a five-year-old's nature-themed party, but party favors that I hope will last and see more than brief use). I would probably get a better quality product if I were using this professionally, but it's a great value for the money.<br /><br />-Each loupe has its own plastic case case, so if you're ordering them as party favors, you don't need to buy bags. Each case is black on the bottom, is clear on the top, and has a molded foam insert that holds the loupe open in roughly the position shown in the photo.<br /><br />-The loupe's edges are a bit sharp, but they don't seem dangerous.<br /><br />-The loupe in the picture is *not* the one you will receive. Oddly, the picture that shows during my review is not the one that showed up when I purchased the product. In either case, though, the loupe you'll receive will have a shiny (not matte) finish; a riveted construction (not screw-based construction), which means it might not stay closed if it sees a lot of use; sharper edges; and lowercase lettering.<br /><br />-The lanyard hole is quite small. It will accommodate smaller-style lanyard j-hooks with just a bit of play, but not larger ones. I've always found loupes to be most useful when they're on lanyards.<br /><br />-If you are using these as favors too, I suggest you take them out of their cardboard boxes before the party. The cases fit snugly in the boxes and would be tricky for little hands to remove.<br /><br />I wanted something that would fit the theme, be useful (not soon-to-be trash), be fun, and inspire learning. I considered ordering magnifying glasses, but they weren't economical for a big party, and the larger pieces of glass (in the decent ones) seemed more risky. I considered lighted loupes, but the reviews for the lower cost ones indicated that we'd probably have to replace batteries, and that gets expensive and tedious. I decided to go with something that would work right out of the box. We haven't had the party yet, but these are nice little loupes. I've opened five of them so far, and they came through shipping just fine. I hope the kids will be excited."
4.0,Just what I wanted. Perfect color to match my daughter's shoes
4.0,Fit well and have lasted over a year and still work perfectly and they fit well
4.0,Really cute! Works with every outfit
4.0,The shoes were cute and adorable love them
4.0,Nice breathable material as advertised but runs small and short. I ordered a size 14/16 for my 100lbs 5’3 slim son and the length of the shirts were short and so was the sleeves.
4.0,Seem to be quality and a good price. Fit as expected.
4.0,"The blouse is nice, but a bit on the big big xl"
4.0,Awesome boots. Good price
4.0,this product fit well they do roll down allot though and they took forever to arrive
4.0,Order size up but super cute and unique something you don’t see in store  slightly see through if you have boobs which I liked it’s a casual shirt but fits body sexy
4.0,"Love the design...attractive, just a tad smaller than expected."
4.0,The clip ons are a little thinner than I expected but all in all great fit. Packaging was inadequate and case was badly damaged.
4.0,"I love it very much, but it came without any back to hold it. Guess I'll  borrow one from another pair."
4.0,Used it for my daughters dance recital and I love it!
4.0,"These pants are very nice quality. They look nice and don’t wrinkle easily. The only reason I didn’t leave 5 stars is because they are a bit small and extra long. I wear a size, but should should have bought an 8."
4.0,"Espero por favor que dentro de lo posible lo pudieran crear x-small, soy delgada y el small no me ajusta.<br /><br />I hope please that as much as possible I could create x-small, I'm thin and the small does not fit me."
4.0,"Loved this until the clasp broke. I will say that was probably my fault because I think I tried to store more cards than what was recommended.  I enjoyed the thin profile and once the clasp was released, the wallet opened wide for easy identification and access to the interior cards.  The clasp could be made from a sturdier medium than plastic, otherwise, it's bullet proof and keeps your cards secure."
4.0,"This Evaless T-shirt is super cute. I love the 3 different patterns in the shirt - it gives it a trendy and unique look!  This fits true to size. The price is a great value too. My only way for taking away a star is because the middle cream colored fabric is thin and the outline of my bra could be seen through the shirt. Overall, this is super cute and I would recommend it!"
4.0,"This is a nice, well made bra but seems to run a bit small on the band size."
4.0,This product would have gotten 5 stars if the inside lining did not tare the very 1st day carried it. I guess as the old saying goes &#34; You get what you pay for&#34;.
4.0,"this light bue and navy wrap dress is smaller than other dresses from the same vendor.  This is a wrap dress, no buttons or snaps, but it runs small.  I am 5'4&#34; and 160 lbs.  I usually wear a size 12, and I got the XXL, and it barely fits.  It will require A LOT OF IRONING, but the fabric is quite fresh, great for very hot weather."
4.0,Very detailed. Much better quality than I expected for the price. Would have given 5 stars but it's only imaged on 1 side
4.0,Kept this one but returned the other girls I had gotten
4.0,The graphic is solid. The hat is not bad but careful if you wash it. Shrinks and panels become distorted.
4.0,"A little tight feeling when first trying on but after they were on, they felt like any other normal sock. Did not leave marks like some tight fitted socks.<br />Regular warmth and feel (nothing special). But cool design. HOWEVER, the swifty pair was not as vibrant as the photo shows. The colors look a bit dull in person but the rick pair is perfect. Overall, definitely worth buying!"
4.0,there really cute . and nice quality. you can dress them up or down . they go with everything and are comfy on my baby's feet .
4.0,the glasses is WoW but the arms are very tall and nose pillows are not comforting
4.0,"I have no problem with them at all. I use a long shirt , so it doesn't matter to me that it is a little see thin."
4.0,"I orders these pants in Burgundy, size XL and they fit just a tad large on my 5'4&#34;, 180 pound frame. I am curvy, with a 30 inch waist and very full hips & bum...I'm usually a size 10/12 in pants and garments that fit my waist are often too small for my bottom half, but these have great stretch.<br /><br />The quality is solid, and I like that the material doesn't wrinkle easily. However, the fabric is not necessarily slimming, and the burgundy color does show if you have any lumps and bumps on the thigh/bum area.<br /><br />I intend to order these again in a darker color (to minimize my imperfections) and in the next size down (large) to see if a more fitted size is more slimming. I recommend - great affordable business casual option."
4.0,Pleasantly surprised how comfortable these socks are.  I wear these now in place of my other compression socks which cost nearly twice as much. Haven’t had them long enough to know how long they will last but so far very good.
4.0,I purchased  one size than what I usually wear due to others reviews. It fits great.
4.0,"[[ASIN:B000ISEZP0 Army Green Canvas Messenger Bag Handbag]]A nice bag for me to use when I am running my errands on the weekend. I like the zippered pockets, and I also like the fact the bag is lightweight and not bulky. I like it because it also can go over my shoulder. It was also a nice price."
4.0,"Practical, but the zippers failed after the first use"
4.0,"Fits good, the Jim Lee art on the shirt is great"
4.0,"The necklaces are great for holding crystals! My only problem is that the biggest necklace, well you know how you put the crystal in the netting, when I use it there’s just a big patch at the bottom where the crystal isn’t covered and I’m scared that eventually that patch would get big enough for the crystal to actually fall through! Other than that tho I love these!"
4.0,"The material is a bit different than I expected.  Polyester like.  This wouldn't be winter wear for me.  Having said that, very lightweight and should be a good addition for my summer travel."
4.0,Very comfortable band. Love the color. Fits great.
4.0,"If I was a size 8 model and you just stretched me to a size 18, then this dress would fit. Unfortunately my fat doesn't distribute this way. I know, my fault for not having the body size of the women from whenever there was a standard. I still love my jean jacket and if I lose ten pounds, I will wear it again."
4.0,They are very much like lululemon’s but not as soft. The light pink show a little sweat.
4.0,nice fit nice material thanks
4.0,All around value.
4.0,Great value good quality
4.0,"I love everything about this dress except the material. It is almost like wearing a raincoat- heavy, stretchy material. But it is very cute, fits right, & is very slimming!"
4.0,I like that I can use with other brands.
4.0,"I always order a small, and it usually fits me perfect. This is a little snug..."
4.0,Great fit easy to install.
4.0,The bag is good.
4.0,"This dress was super cute! But the bust/halter was a little big. We safety pinned it, so that it was still loose, but no lady bits would fall out. Then halfway they my son's graduation the halter ripped. Sad face. We still looked super cute though. Seriously best dressed mother / son duet there!"
4.0,"The length was longer than I thought but satisfied it isn't super short. It's better without the straps connected. Straps will detach in wash, be careful. But you will find it."
4.0,Nice length . Thin material
4.0,"These pants fit as expected order your usual size. They are super soft and super comfortable! Can dress up as a work pant or club pant. Only draw back was the elastic waistband will roll, should’ve taken measures to secure it."
4.0,A little smaller than I had envisaged but very pretty and I had several compliments on them.<br /><br />Will enjoy wearing them year after year.
4.0,Cheaper material. Seems more like a pool bag but does the job.  We use it as a diaper bag for quick trips when dad doesn’t want to carry the big bag
4.0,I have very rarely felt comfortable in a two piece bathing suit until I purchased this one. It's so cute! I kept getting &#34;pinup girl&#34; comments from the hubby. It covers my tough areas (love handles and mommy pooch lower tummy) and is classy! I only wish I could have ordered a different size top.
4.0,Protege muy bien
4.0,Would be better If you were able to choose the colors.
4.0,"This bathing suit is super cute!! I wore it for the first time today at an aqua tabata class at my gym. I received so many compliments on it! My hair is red so some of the ladies called me the little mermaid. Lol<br />My only complaints are that the bust does not fit the way the picture shows. I wish it was about 2 inches higher (lengthwise). I'm very tall, big busted and have broad shoulders. I ordered the XL (16-18) and it did fit perfectly everywhere else. The top part tends to fall a little too low cut for me, but it still looks nice. I just found myself having to pull the top up during class. There also was a small hole on the right side of the hip area. It looked like a spot was overlooked during the sewing process. The green fin part of the bathing suit is a bit flimsy and runs darker than the picture but still is cute. I'm debating on buying another color. ;) overall, this is an adorable bathing suit. A couple of drawbacks if your big busted."
4.0,"Very pretty shoes! I typically wear an 8.5, but my heel hung just a bit off the end in these.  Would need a 9 for sure."
4.0,I knew from the webpage to order many sizes larger and I did. So I'm a M or a L normally and I ordered 2XL. It's fits exactly right. Dress is nice.
4.0,Can’t complain for the price! Pretty cute
4.0,"Got package on time, and it fit my 12 year very well she loved it!! Just didn't receive the Keychain that was mentioned was included but no biggie"
4.0,"Although the shirt fit big, the shorts were perfect for my son. He's 6 and 83 pounds, so I struggle finding goalie pants/shorts for him. He loves the entire set and is waiting to order another."
4.0,Comfortable fit with a nice length but the sleeves are a bit large to a point where it almost poofs out and washing it didn't really change the fit. It does give you ample room for working out but wished it was more of a form fit.  I do like the color options and the pattern is really nice looking.
4.0,"These pants fit great but were actually longer than expected.  I ordered a 30 inch inseam and it measured 33 inches!  luckily I do some sewing and was able to quickly hem them to 30 inch inseam so I could take them with me this weekend for my trip.  They feel wonderful on and I love the fabric so may try another pair in a different color to see if I get the right inseam next time.  Being that they are very stretchy it wasn't an easy job nor totally as nice as the original hem, but will do ok for me."
4.0,The shorts are very comfortable. I appreciate the fact that they are not too tight on my legs at the bottom.
4.0,Cute necklace. Seems well made.
4.0,I love these shoes. They fit great.
4.0,"I like it very much, it works good and I like the style. I would recommend to others.Thank you. the end I realy don't like the fact you require how many words I send in my review."
4.0,If your looking for a great looking hat with a unique weave and a north face logo that's a replica then this might work for you.Its well made and no complaints. The &#34;O&#34; in the north is small and the stitching slightly off. Moving inside the label font is not crisp and can be easily removed because of light stitching. Beautiful hat and I will wear it but not authentic.
4.0,nice color and large size easily read dial
4.0,"It's good looking, soft, fits well.  It's not a heavy sweater, but is good for either layering or a more brisk fall or spring day.  Goes well over a button up and underneath a coat.<br /><br />The buttons add some character, though I don't really think they have much of a point.  They do actually operate as buttons, and I suppose they could make it slightly easier to get over your ahead, but I've never actually unbuttoned them.<br /><br />Both work appropriate but also casual.  Goes well with both khakis and jeans."
4.0,"I'm using these boots as a starting point for a wonder woman or Superwoman outfit.  They are perfect for my needs, and its impossible to find anything in my size.  Thank you!!"
4.0,My 10 yr. old neice is already accustomed to the pain we silly females endure for fashion.  But what threw me was that many other comments said they were sized Larger than typical.
4.0,sexy i have this dress in all colors
4.0,Price is a little high
4.0,I was having doubts in buying this product because of other reviews. But I like it! I'm 5'1 and 120 pounds so I went with a small. If you want nit to look oversize then go a size up. The only thing I do not like is that the zipper gets stuck every time either you leave it up or down if you do not want to struggle with the zipper.
4.0,"Speaking as a man buying woman socks... these are cheap, machine knitted, highly colorful and intricate. These make me happy, but I honestly thought they would be slightly thicker, now they are not super thin but for knitted socks my grandma would call them thin. As a bonus these make my sandals usable and fashionable in winter climates."
4.0,The band was slightly different from the original but well constructed with a smooth surface/feel to it. For my wrist the loop holes are not a perfect fit going from snug to slightly loose but that may just be due to my wrist diameter being an odd size. Otherwise the band is comfortable and remains secure on my wrist. Highly recommend for a direct replacement!
4.0,I am very pleased with the quality of this shirt. Nice and thick material. Unfortunately it runs small. I ordered 1 size bigger but really should have ordered 2 more than I wear. Otherwise it's a great shirt- just buy much bigger than you normally need.
4.0,"I ordered a large, but it is a little short on me (5'7) 145lb"
4.0,"I would not recommend for everyday wear (it feels a bit cheap), but it looks good and feels comfortable."
4.0,"Overall very pleased. Very cute and fits well, but the material is thinner than expected."
4.0,Pretty good shirt for the price. Size was just a bit large but not bad
4.0,"They are good, but to the seller/manufacturer: for the love of God please change the case!!! The case that contains these shades is too small and warps them! They intially made me a bit dizzy and gave me a slight headache, but once I flattened the shades, they were much better."
4.0,This is a cute suit and fit as expected. I took the bra cup out because they were too small.
4.0,I'm small (5'6&#34; 150lb).  Have broad shoulders for a small man. Small size to too small and medium is slightly long in the sleeves. I prefer slightly large than too small.  Happy with the med.  Very comfortable.  Recommend. If you're like me and read every review before buying.  Buy Russell over Champion. I've had both and Russell is better.
4.0,I am 5’8 and ordered a large. Looking forward to using this as a beach coverup.
4.0,Very nice like it my mom love it
4.0,"These are very small. While they would work for an adult, I see these being more appropriate for a child. Now, to find a child. I was buying these for my teenage daughter but I'm not sure they would look right on her."
4.0,"The band is loosening after a few months of fairly regular wear, so only 4 stars. I have a shallow bust and these cups fit pretty well."
4.0,"Bigger than I expected, but still worked. Got them for us for bowling nights.. Ordered a small for a friend, and a large for myself. I probably could have gotten the small as well. Cute, kinda gaudy. I got compliments on it, but not from my husband. He hates it lol..but I didn't purchase it to wear every day."
4.0,"Beautiful shirt, but size down! I was swimming in it!"
4.0,"These lenses seem to be pretty good quality. There is a little bit of wiggle or play in the frame because the lenses aren't the exact perfect size. I would recommend these, good quality."
4.0,The design and fit of of this dress is super cute. I'm 5' 3&#34; and ordered a medium and it hits at my mid-calf. The only thing I didn't like was that it pills after you wash it a couple of times.
4.0,It's a bit lighter in color than the pic shows.  Had a little odor when it first arrived but aside from that I love it!
4.0,"Good product, fits as expected, good deal."
4.0,Fit my big head comfortably. Like that the brim can be turned up or down. Material is soft and somewhat thin with a little texture. Not sure it has the best fabric for sun protection.
4.0,It is beautiful and everything is great but I’m 4’9 and it’s waay too long on me
4.0,"Works as stated, looks nice and fashionable, keeps my mask handy."
4.0,Very good support. Seem to be holding up well to washing too. Highly recommend if you are on your feet all day. I'm getting ready to order another pair!
4.0,"I ordered a white and blackshirt.  The shirt is made well, but the fabric is too transparent, so I am not able wear it. I am not sure what kind of undershirt would look ok with it."
4.0,"Sunglasses is sturdy, well built. Comfortable wear all day. The style is nice, stylish. My go to sunglasses. Waiting for summer to really test it out."
4.0,Nice lounge around the house/errand dress
4.0,"This is a really cute, sporty vest.  I like the finish of the fabric.  It's not super shiny like some puffer jackets/vests.  I removed the gray knit hood (zips off) because it looked awkward.  I did take off one star because the lining is terribly, terribly ugly.  It's a crinkly nylon with Eolvin Klein and eK printed all over (see photo) as a knock off of Calvin Klein.  If I could just cut it all out  without ruining the vest, I would.  I have gotten a kick out of showing my ""designer"" vest to family & friends ... has been good for laughs.  The vest is warm and I'll keep it and wear it."
4.0,"Nice color, nice material but quite large."
4.0,Better suited mask for a child or smaller teen. Could be used as a cool shoulder piece on cosplay armor.
4.0,"Would give this a five, but I am ordinarily not a &#34;hat&#34; person to begin with, so the product itself is wonderful.  I actually wore it and I NEVER wear hats.  Very cute!!"
4.0,"It looks just like the picture, except it's on a string instead of a leather braid. That is in the description. Nicely detailed.  Nice weight. It is not thin or cheap feeling."
4.0,It's feels like a plastic leather which I don't think it would feel like that but it's cute and big which was what I needed. I'd recommend
4.0,Sizing would improve this product.
4.0,"It is a very cute swimsuit, looks like the picture. The problem with the swimsuit is the top. If you have smaller boobs, then reconsider buying this. The top is two pieces and where the crisscross is, it is not connected so it fits somewhat weirdly and the strap behind the back was too big for me. I ordered a small and I'm 5'7 and 135 with a small b cup. The bottoms fit very well for my liking, but still gonna return for something else."
4.0,Buckle is a bit flimsy but good otherwise.
4.0,Gag gift for my daughter but its nice
4.0,"These masks are comfortable, the adjustable straps are a great touch. Not great for working out as the inner liner has a tendency to get sucked into your mouth with harder breathing. Great for regular everyday coverage though!!"
4.0,"I got these to help my young kindergarten students point to letters and words while reading! They loved them! Only problem was they wanted to turn out the lights, and then it was hard to read. Oh well. They are still super fun. The grand kids wore them on their toes and ran around the dark cabin at our last family reunion. Good times! Buy these, even if there are no kids in your life!"
4.0,"First--we found the sizing to be right on.  I ordered socks for four people at four different shoe sizes and the sizing guide in the listing was accurate as to what size sock we should wear.<br /><br />We were spending the day at an indoor water park, which had torn up our feet in previous trips.  The combo of constantly wet feet with the concrete made for ripped skin and sore spots by the end of a day.  On this trip, we spent 6.5 hrs at the water park, and the water socks did exactly what we wanted them too--protected our feet.  They were comfortable to wear and I was very pleased with the purchase.<br /><br />However, by the end of the day, not one pair of the socks were worth keeping for future trips.  Every pair had holes in the seam between the bottom and top fabrics.  And some of those holes had developed very early on, I would say those holes were due more to the construction than to wear.  Two pairs (the kids') had substantial wear on the bottom at the end of the day.  One pair of the kids had very large holes worn in the surface of the bottom layer--it appeared to be made of multiple layers, so his skin was not exposed.<br /><br />I did not find that the socks dried very quickly (depending on your definition of quick).  But they were very easy to take on/off, so I just took them off when sitting at our table to allow my feet to dry.<br /><br />All in all, these did what I wanted them too--protected our feet.  Given the price point and coupon available when I purchased (under $9/pair), I'm glad we got them.  If I had the same performance out of a pricier item I would have been very disappointed."
4.0,My husband hates masks. This is only one he can handle. Wouldn't recommend if you're trying to hide from covid-19.
4.0,"Nice watch, but the clasp fell apart when I got it and paid to have it fixed. As such, the so call value disappeared."
4.0,Very pretty. the shorts ride up a bit but not too uncomfortable. the straps are adjustable like a bra.
4.0,When i ordered this I thought it was somewhat elven looking.  It is larger than i thought but still nice.
4.0,"Though the top was a tad big on me, it wasn't enough to kill the overall vibe and look of the swimsuit. The bottoms fit perfectly - which I expected. So, overall, I was pleased with the purchase. The quality is also very good - which at times with Amazon purchases, can be a hit or a miss.<br /><br />I am a proud customer."
4.0,"Perfect beautiful shoes, exactly as expected! The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is because I have a bunion bone starting developing on my both feet and the shoe does not cover enough, making a bit evident my slightly deformed feet shape (if the shoe covered my feet a bit more that would not be visible)."
4.0,fits small child maybe up to six years old.
4.0,This dress was so beautiful for Easter!
4.0,Beautiful.  Just a tiny bit small but I am a 36D. Sheer. Looks just as shown.
4.0,Runs on the small size but the quality is excellent.
4.0,Love my stylish Lauren wellies; wear them every time it rains
4.0,"It was cute and got lots of complements. But couldn’t get it to stay on really good, on the head band or clipped in. It traveled very well in my suit case too. All and all great for the price."
4.0,The balance to the force. And my outfit .
4.0,This shirt was great. Wore it at the Super Bowl Party on the cruise and received lots of compliments!
4.0,I bought two of these shirts. Love the colors. I normally wear a 2X so that’s what I ordered. It’s a little too tight in the boobs and belly. Got a great price so I’m not returning. Hopefully losing a few pounds will help the fit.
4.0,Loved them but I do wish they had had more beads
4.0,Good scrubs for the price
4.0,"I was looking for stretchy, pretty, lightweight gloves to wear for protection while shopping during these Covid 19 times that would accommodate my long nails.  These were almost perfect.  The silky fabric is great and they do stretch.  Tiny polka dots are cute.  Seaming was about 80% perfect but the sizing is mostly consistent in all 3 colors that I purchased:  dark champagne, beige, and black.  For some reason, index finger was squarer.  With long nails, they JUST fit.  I would give them 5 stars if the fingers were just a bit longer and the seaming was 100% perfect.  However, they absolutely work for what I purchased them for so I'd still very much recommend."
4.0,The buttons are very colorful and nicely detailed.  Will be fun with &#34; Wonderland&#34; themed party.  My only issue is that there are four Alice buttons in a pack of twelve buttons.
4.0,"This bag is huge! I thought this bag would be like a regular tote for everyday use but this size Is meant for the beach or travel. The design is beautiful, it’s just a little too big."
4.0,"I typically wear extra large shirts in extra large so I got an extra large of this dress. The length of it was much higher than the model so I felt uncomfortable unless I wore pants underneath it. If you have a curvy figure, you might want to look for something less form-fitting or wear leggings if you're self-conscious. The color is beautiful and I still wear it I'm just more careful in what"
4.0,"This dress fit as expected. I received a lot of compliments about the dress. I loved it so much, I ordered the black. I would order more.  Great dress!"
4.0,Love it. Perfect fit!
4.0,Love the pockets. The stitches are not as strong. After 3 weeks of running about 20 miles  a week I have found a few strings. To be expected but the are comfy.
4.0,"Cute shoe, great price!"
4.0,The material is a bit thin. Panties are on display - but otherwise cute.
4.0,Christmas gift for grandson.
4.0,"Fabric is a little stiff but still comfortable and makes the shirt look more tailored. Only complaint is the collar which stands up a bit like its stretched out. Wide neckline is really comfy, and the sleeves are nicely capped. Fits like the picture"
4.0,"This shrunk a bit after the first washing, but otherwise fits well and hasn't faded at all."
4.0,A great look
4.0,A little bulkier than I'm used to. But I am glad that it is RFID blocking. The zipper does well. My wife calls it a man purse. But so far it works well. I did have to remove the button with a flat screwdriver that was annoying. Made in India.
4.0,confi dress. Kinda of long and heavy but pretty nevertheless
4.0,"It said one size fits most. When I got them, they all said XL. Because they're stretchy, they fit really good. No hangover skin, low back, low front, adjustable straps, removable padding. Perfect for under tank tops. Holds everything in place"
4.0,A bit uncomfortable.
4.0,Runs a little small...couldn't pass my hips
4.0,If you suffer from plantar fasciitis these flip flops are a lifesaver.
4.0,Neckline too wide
4.0,"These keys were great! There was a nice variety in the pack, and the designs and finishes were lovely. My only complaint is that I ended up with a LOT of the really small keys and not as many of the big keys, which was a bit disappointing."
4.0,The top was a little small but that’s expected because I have a large chest but the bottoms and the wrap are so perfect
4.0,Very nice earrings. As described
4.0,"A great sock to buy,just get the right size. The medium size is to small unless you want a tighter fit. A large size is what I wanted,but no option tab on the order link? ( just medium ) ?  I am returning my first order and will try to order again ?"
4.0,"Very satisfied. It was as expected and satisfied for the make, only wished it would be a bit longer for the height of the user, so no need to bend."
4.0,"The size chart wasn't very helpful for this. By the chart, I was a 9, but I received them yesterday and I am more of a 7 for these pants. Now I will have to return them and get an exchange. *sugh*. Other than that, I like the pants. They are a nice color and soft texture."
4.0,"The linen blend is solid. I think it will shrink some when washed and there's no way I would put these in the dryer, but that's true of anything made of linen. I think the cut is forgiving enough to stand a little shrink. The waistband is well constructed, elastic, and comfortable, and I like the look of the stitching on the pockets and trim. Overall, really cute, definitely something I can incorporate into my lagenlook collection and at a much better price point than the European boutiques."
4.0,The socks did not fit. They were too small.
4.0,"was very shiny and all of the jewels stayed in until about 2 months in. I use it as a Medusa ring. Wore it every day, got lots of compliments! Eventually, it began to weather quickly and all of the gemstones fell out. Would definitely buy again for the price"
4.0,I loved the shirt but it was way big.  It was built well and had good shape.  It has a nice feel and is a good weight and the color was great!  We had to return it because it was really big!!
4.0,Not the best quality. Or very tight. But they are comfy!
4.0,"I love this dress! It’s very red. And I usually wear a medium, but ordered a large and it fits great!"
4.0,Bought for my son. Hard to get the back on the post so I used another one. Worked fine.
4.0,"I've always been a size 9, and these fit in the snug side. I have to wear a thin sock. But to be fair, I've been pregnant twice and my feet grew both times. They're comfortable, though. I don't know if I could walk long distances in them, as the top front rim digs into my ankle a bit. I'm sure they'll soften up, though. The ankle is very low, I may get lower socks or the peds so you can't see a sock."
4.0,SUPER cute sports bra! I got the white and black. I love the straps on the back! The only downside was that it was a little tight. I have been stretching them out as I wear them though so that’s good! Seriously super cute with an open back top!
4.0,The earrings arrived packaged well in bubble wrap and in a nice velvet bag.  They are sterling silver with a turquoise stone.
4.0,"This a premium glove and I use it regularly when travelling to the office. Based on my measurements, the gloves were a bit larger than expected. I can not use for browsing on the iPhone.  Overall, good gloves and I am recommending buying a pair.<br /><br />Update March 6, 2019: after using this pair of gloves in New England weather, the gloves don’t do well below 32 degrees (F) and ski trails. It’s not meant for heavy duty."
4.0,Front zippers are kind of small. My hand gets stuck. I like the back chain and interior is good.
4.0,"XXL, Good"
4.0,These would be perfect if they didn't stain the top of my feet. You really need a hard scrubbing to get it off.
4.0,"I actually love this! It's very cute, drapes beautifully, color is nice. The reason for 4 stars is the loose stitching at the back of the neckline. I'll need to stitch some reinforcement in that area to keep it from fraying. It is just to cute to return! Received promptly."
4.0,"The watch is what I expected. However, I can't remove one of the links from the bracelet"
4.0,Love this top. A little too big on the arms. When i wear it i have to emd up pulling up the arks as to try ans hide the fact that they are to big.. But other than that love this top
4.0,Overall a good pair of hiking pants. The front pockets are lined in mesh and items tend to get stuck in there. That's probably its function but I'm not a fan of this feature.
4.0,"I love this dress! Especially for the price. I wore it for my bridal shower, and ordered the blush color. I got so many compliments on it- people couldn’t believe I bought it off amazon!<br />The material isn’t what I was expecting, it is kind of cloth like, so for that reason I am taking off a star. However, it is TTS and a cute dress. Will probably order more colors!"
4.0,The band on the bottom is too thin for me. It tends to bunch up under my bust. Other than that it’s a pretty good sports bra for the price.
4.0,"This shirt is a traditional fit, I couldn't squeeze into a tailored fit garment, and suits me very well.  The button down collar has the right roll, which you usually don't get in reasonable priced shirts, however the shirt is not very long, but I think the reason is many men, today, don't tuck in their shirts, sad, but that is my only quibble and the only reason I didn't rate it four stars. Overall good shirt."
4.0,"Colors are pretty and fabric is thick and nice , just don’t stay on  and also , purchase two sets because I thought I ruined the first one by drying them in in the dryer  but even the second set by hair drying then shrunk a bit , they still go up high on her knee but they slide right off<br />Still wear them , but not much since I wanted them to cover her legs for the cool weather"
4.0,It’s so pretty. I love the length. It doesn’t look rose gold. It’s more gold.
4.0,"I would give this 5 stars if it weren't for the smell.  I sprayed febreeze hoping that would help and let it air out over night, but it still smells.  HOWEVER, the color is perfect, I love all the room in it and it is simply a great value!"
4.0,Great shirt just a few snags in fabric that stand out
4.0,"I had to buy a size up, since they run slim"
4.0,These look great. The problem is they need something soft at the tips. They fit great but will scar your face if you are not careful because of the unprotected sharp tips.
4.0,"This dress is very pretty.<br />The dress hugs my body the right way, and fits as expected.<br />Fabrics of the dress are soft against the skin.<br />The flowers are a little out of focus I would say."
4.0,"These are functional and very affordable.  They are meant for a kids craft project, so my standards may not be as high as others but they were a great length, attractive and fairly durable.  Some of the clamped-on ends of the cords came off, but since they are being used by 10-12 year olds in craft projects, I am not sure I can blame the product since kids are a bit rough.  That said, it is only 1-2 out of the lot of 50 that had issues, even with the rough handling.  Great value for the money, especially compared to alternatives I have seen."
4.0,Would have given five stars but for the hideous label glued to the corner of the wrap.  For heavens sake use a small lightly stitched label that is easily removed.  Very pleased with it otherwise.
4.0,They are a bit wide.
4.0,Handy item to have.
4.0,"I haven't worn them yet but did try them on. They could be a little longer, they are short. Their sizes are way off. I normally wear a 2x and according to there size chart I had to order an 8x and they almost dont fit. I am really tired of the cheap made Chinese crap. I would not order again."
4.0,"I have a hard time getting shoes to fix,,,,,,so I order kids clogs and they fit."
4.0,"Didn't look good on me, very much just a t-shirt with a draw string waist, but would look good on others."
4.0,"The quality of the leather on this reversible dress belt by Vetelli is really nice.  I always buy my husband reversible belts because it's just easier to pack when he travels for work.  The belt buckle is easy to rotate to switch from black to brown leather.  It has an overall sleek and stylish appearance.  We are very please with the quality and ease of use.  The reason that I am giving this belt 4 stars instead of 5 is because this size 32 belt fits tighter than my other husband's size 32 belts.  When comparing to other belts we own it is only a tad bit shorter, but the biggest difference is where the belt sizing holes begin.  I wish that I would have ordered him a 34 in this particular belt.  I would consider sizing up if you or the recipient uses the looser end of the sizing holes in their current belt.<br /><br />I was able to purchase this item at a discount in exchange for my honest, unbiased review."
4.0,"Very cute and nicely made, but they are both very small and sit very close to the throat. It can be a good look, but not exactly what I was looking for."
4.0,"Great size, holds a lot without being bulky. Long strap perfect for wearing as crossbody."
4.0,I initially thought when purchasing this bag that it was going to be leather instead I found it is almost like a plastic fabric which isn't a deal breaker for me but I kind of wish I had known that upon ordering since it does make lot of noise. But what I really do like is the cool purple iridescent color of it and its perfect size for my everyday necessities so  all that makes me over look the type of fabric. Not sure how durable it is yet but I will follow up with an update once Ive had it for awhile!
4.0,Good quality kids gaiters....exactly as described ... no complaints
4.0,"like..Nice color, nice graphics, and well layed out. Only thing, back of hat seems whimpy. Otherwise well pleased."
4.0,I got this for my boyfriend and he gave up using his original wallet for this he liked it so much. He did wish it had a couple more card holders though.
4.0,"Nice oversized glasses fit my face well and are comfortable , for the most part windproof . If u have a large head/face these or for you"
4.0,This pj set is comfy and soft. Fit size L was perfect on arrival but shrunk a size through the wash/dryer. Will purchase a second pair sizing up this time around
4.0,I love this locket because it is large and pretty.  I gave it to my mother who likes larger necklaces and the chain is a great length..not too long but just right.  I like how the felt pads hold more oil.
4.0,"I’m surprised most reviews said to order a size up. I’m 5’8,145lbs, 37-26-37 and ordered a size 6. It fit well in the chest and hips but was baggy and roomy in the middle. It also hit below the knees. I wish I had ordered a size 4."
4.0,Really nice quality. Usually I am a medium and i would get a small next time for more bra suppor
4.0,"Barely fit into this one. I did order a size larger than typical thanks to the size chart listed. Very short, too."
4.0,"These are cute matching dresses! There aren’t pockets, but the quality is decent and they were fun to wear for Christmas."
4.0,"Runs a little tight for a 14, but still a reasonable fit."
4.0,"I have had a heck of a time recently with buying chinese clothing on here and getting stuff that's not even REMOTELY like what the picture shows (I know some of you ladies know what I'm talking about!).  THIS jumpsuit was one of the few that looks like it does in the picture.<br /><br />It's made of a woven material, but you'll probably want to wash it before wearing, because it doesn't drape well with all the starch/sizing in it when it arrives.<br /><br />The only real issues I have with it (hence the loss of a star) are:<br /><br />1) the leg openings seem larger than the picture shows, and<br />2) It seems better for short-waisted women.  I have a long torso, small waist, and larger rear and chest, and it fit to size in my chest and rear, was big in the waist (which is fine, since it has the belt), but it seems to ride up a bit when I move.  I think if I wore it for a long period of time, it would become aggravating.  However, if you are regular- or short-waisted, it'll probably be fine!"
4.0,Good quality for what we paid for them.  Pleased with purchase.
4.0,Good for the price.  Suited my needs.
4.0,"The only thing I wish they would do, is put something along side the necklace to compare the size of the chain. 7MM was alot larger than I thought."
4.0,"item is just as pictured.  quality is fine, exactly what you expect for the price."
4.0,"Looks as displayed, am pleased with quality for price."
4.0,"I love the purse. I've had numerous compliments on it. I seem to have a hard time getting the little latch to turn shut, but that is small in comparison to how cute it is."
4.0,Smaller than I first realized but was a hit. We had the girls personalize it with chalk and paint markers for their senior on the squad. Fits on book shelf.  Will buy again.
4.0,"Heavier than expected, but not that bad overall. Cute style. Happy with purchase."
4.0,When I first ordered this dress the sizing said it was Asian size which is Smaller than us sizes. But then it says US x-small is Asian Small. I ordered a Large (expecting a US medium) but it fit like an extra large.. the effort to return it was a hassle so I got a $10 refund and keep the dress. They we're reasonable and quick to respond
4.0,[[VIDEOID:c06a39cd563fac6a2ebd3de6d46bd865]] All of them are very bright with vivid colors. Super thin so I wouldn’t recommend if you are using these as face protection. I’ve washed them several times and they are still in good condition.
4.0,"Shipping took a very long time, I was actually worried they got lost in the mail.  When they arrived, I was disappointed to find that the design is a sticker and one of the earring's pictures was stuck to the packaging they came in and almost got thrown away.  They are very small and lightweight which is nice for an earring."
4.0,Like the colors and my son says it’s comfortable. Champion tends to run small so I ordered xl. The xl fits like a large.
4.0,Love love this dress!! Received  multiple compliments both times I have worn dress!
4.0,Cute sweater but thinner sweater than we thought.
4.0,This necklace looks great on. For the money a good buy
4.0,Really cute used in a gift exchange
4.0,"Very nice dress, but was a bit snug. I know if I loose a couple pounds which I intend too, it will look great."
4.0,"The dress is nice but its big on me. I realized it would be since the bust measurements given by the company is 37in and I'm 32in. Don't base your size off of what other people write, its true to size as given by the company. I still really like the style so i will overlook the slight size difference. The material crinkles easily and it doesn't help the way it is packaged. Mine came in two bags, added protection but it crushes the fabric, which leaves creases in the fabric. Yes i can iron it out, which i did, but its difficult to get the creases out. The dress seems longer than i originally expected. It comes down mid calf (Im 5'1''). Also i paid for two day shipping and it came a day late. Thankfully my event was two days after the delivery date so i wasn't too worried. Overall a beautiful dress which i will love wearing for a long time. I might even buy another in a different color."
4.0,Looks just like in the picture - i don't like things really tight so i ordered a size up from my normal size. Its a tad big in a couple locations (mostly shoulders) but overall fits well and glad i went a size larger.
4.0,"I’ve bought these a couple times, as they stay on my head well and wash nicely. They are a little warm for some of my workouts, but no complaints."
4.0,Holds a lot of &#34;stuff&#34; but was a little larger than expected.
4.0,"Biggest drawback is there is no bra see in, the nipples will show through, unless you’re wearing your own bra. The fit is somewhat strange, the leggings don’t quite create a fitted skin tight look. I have thick thighs and even then, they seem to ever so slightly droop in some parts closer to the knee. Pros are the dress part fits like a tunic so it covers the bum but doesn’t go all the way to the knee. It’s very flattering, and I love the design of the colors. It looks very aquatic without compromising any modesty. It dried pretty fast, and it’s been through the washer without shrinking or fading."
4.0,"The first one broke, so we got a new one for free"
4.0,Great deal...nice product
4.0,I do think this dress is beautiful!! The peachy pink color is lovely. The quality is really great also. I purchased this dress last year in black. I still wear it and love it! So of course I wanted to order it in another color. Well... the sizing changed dramatically. The dress was enormously long and full. The first one I ordered was a perfect fit. It hangs about 2 inches above my knees and nicely fitted on the top. I’m 5’7” and weigh 150ish. I’m also on the busty side. I ordered an XL. I ordered the same size in the peachy pink and Wow!! The dress was way past my knees and the arm holes were much bigger. So I would say stick with your regular size or maybe go smaller if you want it shorter.
4.0,"This is a cute little summer dress, but is too low in the chest. I use double sided tape which helps it not to gap open. The colors are really nice, and I actually ordered another one. Beware that it’s not a dress to wear on a windy day. The bottom of the dress has a wrap section that isn’t a problem unless wind blows in the wrong direction."
4.0,"These are so super cute. Some of the paint for the eyes is off center so that's why I rated 4 stars and not 5. Besides that, I'm very happy with my purchase!"
4.0,"The flower was placed off center and some of the plastic pieces of the flowers separated within the tulle on the bottom, only noticeable if you are looking for imperfections."
4.0,"I liked the dress but it was too small in the chest area. I have a bigger chest, so that may be the reason why. It just didn't look good around that area. The material was nice and stretchy which I liked because I didn't want it form fitting. For being 5'4 the length was right to my knees which was fine. I really wish the dress fit better or I would of kept it, but sadly I am returning it."
4.0,I like it. I am not huge and not small. About average I guess and it fits great.  A little large actually. I wish it had a Velcro closure like previously stated cause I wish it could be a little more snug around the base of the penis and testicles to stay on better.
4.0,"cheap chokers, but you do get all of them! it's basically exactly what you would expect!"
4.0,"Looked great for the one day I wore it, washed it with other darks and it stained in the wash :("
4.0,I love the way they fit will buy more in different colors
4.0,Pretty simple instructions even for the novice user to adjust the band.
4.0,Looks like in the pic. A little smaller than I thought. Good quality.
4.0,"These are pretty breathable, and have a nice pattern. They are sewn well. The only thing is they are pretty long so it makes the base of my neck hot. If these were like an inch shorter I’d give this 5 stars. I use them while I go for a walk since masks are required in my area."
4.0,"Pretty, but cheaply made. Good for kids who are always losing one, so you're not out a fortune. They're exactly what I expected for the price."
4.0,Love the look just worried will not fit the babies head. Will see when he comes this summer. Hope it does.
4.0,MuchSmaller than ones we used to have 10 years ago.
4.0,Está bien todo
4.0,Very cute earring pack.  Nice quality for the price.
4.0,I usually wear a 36c and size large underwear. I ordered a 36D and the bra barely fit and the underwear not even close. Runs very small.
4.0,"Sexy. Nice fit. A little uneven stitching but for the price, it's do-able"
4.0,"The crown wasn’t the best quality, but the costume itself was fantastic, and the price is unbeatable. Fits super well and looks really really good. The Burgundy color of the drape is also really nice and gives it that “Roman” feel that I was looking for"
4.0,"This was bought for my daughter for Christmas. She loved it and we loved it on her. However, the sleeves were too long and they gape at the wrist and let in the cold air. She took the scissors to the jagged add-on's to the wrist and cut them off. Next, she'll be sewing some elastic around the wrists to keep the warm air in."
4.0,"I liked it but I should have got the XS,  Im a size 6.  It didn't roll under my dress and is quite smoothing in the right places"
4.0,"A mottling, but the elastic cuffs help"
4.0,A few had defects..  but most were fine.  I've ordered these a few times for my diy project.  I will order again.  Arrived quickly as described.
4.0,OMG is what I have to say about this very cute adorable purse I got it when it was only $13.00 I'm a Animal rescurer mostly dogs so my heart loves all things dog related I get sooo much positive attention from this purse it makes me smile just knowing that I was lucky enough to get one ...okay so I do feel a little guilty that a co worker wants one too<br />But it's just too dang unique to share w\her where I got this lil doggie jule from<br />So thanks Amazon 4 always connecting me with such special unique items needless to say I love my doggie-face purse I have 4 stars not 5 B/c the strap is kind of weak but so what I still love his sad little sweet face
4.0,"Cute shirt. The sizing chart for this item is useless. And the reviews varied from &#34;true to size&#34; to &#34;too big&#34; and &#34;too small!&#34;  I usually wear a medium. Based on reviews I ordered a medium and a large. The medium fits well, but just a tiny bit smaller than I like. The large seemed to be a lot larger than a standard large. ??  So, good luck!"
4.0,Nice belt but go 2 sizes up. Runs small.
4.0,Comfortable but very thin material
4.0,Perfect for swimming in the pool
4.0,It was a little small. I'm a 34 C and I got a large.  But overall I love the look of the  bra.
4.0,Cute bags not bad for the price.
4.0,"It's not a &#34;wow&#34; dress, but it looks good on me and is good for a fall wedding so I'm keeping it. Flattering and not cheap looking. The ribbon adds a nice touch, and I'll wear silver pumps with it to give it a bit of flair. (I got the blue on black)"
4.0,"Looks great, a little big around the top that's why not a full 5 star."
4.0,Little smaller than I was picturing but still great. My mother in law will love it!
4.0,Very dry
4.0,very like.
4.0,This is a nice bracelet got it to go with my watch the only thing that spoiled it was the pink on the heart; should of  left the pink  off of the heart then I could give it a 5.
4.0,Very adorable pendant. It is a little smaller than expected but you can still see the elephants clearly. Bought it for my grandmother and I am sure she will love it!
4.0,Fits nice and the fabric is soft.
4.0,gr daughter cute in it
4.0,"I live the graphics, it speaks for itself. Good cover for the top of ones head. I’m concerned with the durability of this product."
4.0,Amateur simple Star Wars symbol starting to look a little rough on the corners overall it's holding up
4.0,They slide down the face easily but otherwise are good.
4.0,"very nice and LONG strap, one of the zippers is in backwards, didnt notice it at first"
4.0,"I didn't look close enough at the photo and thought these were locking pin backs, which they are not. Service was great -- they arrived quickly!"
4.0,Liked the quality of this set. I bought it for steam punk Nye but ended up not going so had to return it. It came with matching thongs lol which I wasn't aware of. It might look better on a bustier person but I was gonna make it work with some Lacey shirt
4.0,Looks exactly like the picture. Very soft and comfortable. I wore this to a murder mystery dinner show. This dress is think looks like it's for Halloween... runs a bit big.
4.0,"The earrings are beautiful, and they are very nice to be silver plated which doesn't hurt my sensitive ears... one flaw two pairs the hanging ones already broke, thats the only reason i'n giving them four stars and not five."
4.0,"Hole in stitching on shoulder , called is more of a teal not blue ,fealls really nice , will shrink a bit"
4.0,"Love these, they’re adorable. I bought an 8 though thinking it’d give her some growing room. We have the straps already adjusted as much as possible though. Consider ordering up one to give you a little more time!"
4.0,"Very cute, nicely made. Love the lime green woven material inside and that it has multiple pockets. It’s a nice size as well, not huge but I can fit a decent amount."
4.0,"They look good and feel good, not a lot of arch support."
4.0,"I ordered a 3xl and thought the fit of this item was great. My waist is around 34 and my hips around 42. But the cups were a bit too big for my size. However, I thought it covered the tummy area well and gave the appearance of a flat stomach. I believe this bathing suit maybe more suited to the bigger chested ladies. I still think the suit is great otherwise."
4.0,"It's a pretty dress and is well made. It doesn't look as dressy in person, but it is a very nice dress for all but very formal events. The fit is very flattering for curvy girls."
4.0,"The product looks very well made, but unfortunately I haven't been able to use it. A majority of the reviews say to order one size down, which I did after taking precise waist measurements. Unfortunately that turned out to be awful advice, because now I have a waist trainer that runs two sizes too small instead of one. Oh well, Maybe I'll be able to wear it once I meet my weight loss goal...<br /><br />As I said, it looks and feels well made. But one star off for poor sizing guidelines."
4.0,works good  does what I wanted them to do
4.0,"The jacket itself is gorgeous. However, it reeks of women's perfume! It was clearly bought and returned by another buyer, which I understand happens, but the smell is unacceptable. There needs to be some sort of quality control over re-selling stinky items."
4.0,"Larger than I was anticipating and I'm going to find a different chain that's a bit stronger, otherwise the owl is exactly what I thought it would be. Arrived fairly quickly and for the price, it was a great deal and it is tempting to get another one or two."
4.0,Good fit and color; fabric not as think as I expected or wanted. But it will work and be easier to pack for travel.
4.0,Nice and light for bike ridding out on the winding... but this color shows the &#34;package&#34; if your going out among folks...a jock strap would be needed.
4.0,My grand daughter loved it.  She loves Vampire Diaries.
4.0,"Really like the watch,  however, I need a much smaller band"
4.0,"I love bucket hats, and the more portable the better. This is a very classic black version, that goes well with just about anything. It has two cute decorative buttons that, surprisingly, make it look much more fashionable than the usual run of the mill bucket hat.<br />I wore this to an outdoor memorial service and did not look conspicuous at all. I've worn this on walks, and again, it's comfortable and fits right in. The fabric is sturdy, and the black is rich. It's really well made.<br />The size of the band is adjustable, which is nice. Except that I don't need to adjust it because it fits snug on my head. SO if you have a tiny head this would be great. If you are any bigger in the nog than normal, you might want to get a second hat in case this one needs to be returned.<br />For the price and quality this is a great staple to have!"
4.0,Very nice and comfy but it is a tad sheer.
4.0,Light weight I wear it to the gym
4.0,"The satin fabric feels pretty good on the skin, but it would be better if the fabric had more stretch to it, like the Barbra brand satin fabric.  I have tried both the Peachy Panty style and Rose Love style hi-cuts and I do like the Rose Love waistband more than the Peachy Panty.  However, theyre both made with the same stiff fabric, which creates gaps with the hi-cut style for some guys (me included).  Dont get me wrong, they are pretty comfortable."
4.0,This dress is very flattering  Under 130lbs  5‘4“ cup size C  Washes well in  A garment bag on delicate and hang to dry.  Actually saw The dress  a lot cheaper.  It is not high-quality but when it’s on it’s  cute and comfortable.
4.0,My 7 yr-old loves them.
4.0,Bought before. They are nice but not their best flip flop.
4.0,I wear 32c bras and purchased a medium . Fit well enough but I prefer a closer fit so I wished I'd bought the small instead . Aw well... good quality for price
4.0,"Great versatile lower cut t-shirt but it runs small.  The chest measurements on the sizing chart for a large was supposed to fit me with 4” to spare but it was very snug.  I bought the XL which was 8” more than my chest measurement and it fit perfectly.  The arms run a little snug too, but overall a good fit."
4.0,Perfect for Halloween! It does run small so size up for the jacket
4.0,Material is so soft and comfortable! A tad small but works.
4.0,this was a very cute dress and was very good quality but I went by the reviews and got the size i usually wear and felt it was a bit to snug and accentuated my curves ( fat rolls) a bit much even wearing spanx . I would suggest a size up . Im returning it unfortunatley.
4.0,Love my Ukes.  A little hard to get on but otherwise fit well.
4.0,"This was the first nose ring I purchased as a replacement for the starter jewelry. The titanium is great and causes zero irritation. Insertion is easy. The stone is pretty small so it doesn't sparkle very much, which is disappointing if you're going for a noticeable effect but probably good if you're looking for something subtle."
4.0,"So far I like the fleece crew, but haven't had it long enough to see how its washes and stains, I seems to have trouble with white fleece staining easily so am waiting to see"
4.0,I like the necklace it's Hollow and very lightweight
4.0,I was in need for a white dress for my friend birthday party but I didn’t want to spend a lot of money for the one time use. So I took the chance and I bought this dress from this seller. Surprisingly it fit really good and was really flattering. It’s is as described. Love it and I will wear it again.
4.0,I like the sweater . It's light weight . Perfect for a cool spring / summer cover . Runs small
4.0,I like the color and size of them. Thank you
4.0,Just got it yesterday so I can only relay my first impressions.  Soft and very well made.  I don't care for the handles so I will probably use the extra strap that came with it.  The handles are thick and round and kind of bulky. They would be better if they were a little longer and thinner. But still a great bag. Just the right size for me.
4.0,Cute and comfortable casual top.
4.0,Very comfortable.  Fabric feels better than I thought it might.  I like the higher waistline.
4.0,Liked the style!!!! the material !!!!!<br /> BUT to small
4.0,"The Stark Direwolf insignia is very sparkly, and kind of large. Would be perfect for those who like the bling."
4.0,Arreglar las tallas
4.0,The dress is nice but plain.  I bought the bright yellow and when the weather is cooler here in Texas I plan on dressing it up withe a black cards and pooka dot scarf.
4.0,when i ordered online i was not sure it would look as good as it does.<br />im a happy online customer
4.0,"Nice detail, though big for a lapel pin, measuring almost 1.5 inches across."
4.0,I love the feel and the fit. I thought I ordered 34 inseam. Not what a received.
4.0,Probably not thick enough for squats but great for lighter workouts and super cute! Loved where the waist hit and how far the top came down. Wosh it had pockets tho!
4.0,"*** I originally left a review talking about how these were great, but they were too big for me. The seller contacted ME and offered me a refund, just from seeing a review. That is amazing customer service. Gives you a lot of confidence in the company that they are paying close attention to the customer experience, and are dedicated to providing  a product that will work well.<br />The masks were good material, but the size was too big for me. If you are a person that finds that most scarf masks are too tight or could use a bit more room, these are absolutely the masks for you."
4.0,They are a nice material !! Definatly good for the price!! Super fast .. i ordered 2 days ago and they are already here❤
4.0,Good buy is nice strong magnet to hold money.
4.0,Nice just as advertised
4.0,Loved these leggings up until a hole appeared in the crotch after wearing them maybe a handful of times. I'm heart broken.
4.0,This worked OK. It is a little loose and although long enough does not cover the whole neck as it bunches. It would have been better if it was a little elasticized. Maybe a smaller size would have been tighter. I am 5' 9&#34;
4.0,Picked these for the moon design but it does not fit well didn't like it at all but the rest of the jewelry is super cute and its will and it comfortable
4.0,Really cute for the price. Small fit and cheap material but it's ok considering the price.
4.0,Love the hoodie only down fall is lettering faded quite a bit after one wash.
4.0,"I originally found this brand in either a TJ Maxx or a Marshalls (I can't remember) and ended up loving it for the price. I've since come on to Amazon to buy more as needed. They are fantastic for the money. They're soft, comfortable, not see-through, they don't show sweat (at least not the black, I've had other black pants that do), matte (I hate shiny pants!), and they hold up to multiple wearings & washings. The biggest negative is that they do eventually stretch out so that I'm constantly pulling them back up during any high-impact exercise. And I've found this particular pair runs slightly big. I'm 5'3&#34; and usually wear a size 8, I ordered a  medium and it fits well if I wasn't wearing them for exercise, but a little loose in the waist for exercise (have to pull them up on occassion). But my body style is bigger hips to smaller waist, so it's not unexpected. I think if I went down to a small they'd probably be too tight (i.e. camel toe). So for cheap money, these are great!"
4.0,"Hmm I decided i needed to share my opinion, Altho I only received one actual ring shown, there othere were cute the balls are small than i thought but there cute anyways. I got three sets of three that were the same two sets of two a horse shoe which i didnt expect..and soem ones with spikes different colors alot of clear ones too as in white clear not clear color. BUT Im giving this a high rating because i wanted the triples I have three on one side and i like to match. AND really 5 bucks? who is complaining? plus i got 21 lol it was nice sense the horseshoe is to small to go in my lip or nose its not useful to me so it was like a free trial lol I think for 5 bucks...come on lets not get picky"
4.0,Comfortable!  Great to throw on over anything!  The only annoying factor is the back neck facing which always wants to be OUTSIDE instead of inside where it belongs.
4.0,Dry quick and great for the gym bag!
4.0,"I ordered a M/L and it’s slightly small.. still fits and is stretchy. IS squat proof even though it’s a tad tight through the butt and thighs. I have thick muscular legs though. This would’ve fit someone very large.. I’m 150 lbs, 5’0 and muscular/stocky build."
4.0,"I have seen these same watches go for $120!  It’s a novelty watch so don’t expect high quality time keeping here!  It’s a cool conversation piece at best, the quality is pretty good for the pricing."
4.0,"This item fit well, is slightly flimsy but not bad at all. It came in a nice case and I will buy another pair."
4.0,"Really, not so bad! its not the real deal so I wasnt sure what to expect but it looks pretty good!"
4.0,"It's true that the wrist band is too big and cannot be shortened and also not replaceable.<br />**I might have a hard time putting in on due to the limited stretch of the silicone(or I'm being too careful?) if it's shorter.<br />It's true that it's cheaply made.<br />**It IS inexpensive and looks totally fine from a distance.<br />It's true that the face is absolutely purple and not a *perfect* match for the burgundy wrist band.<br />**I like purple better than burgundy, so I had planned on replacing the band but couldn't even pop off the 2 posts that connect it to the watch. I might waste the silicone band by cutting it off and figure out a way to attach a metal expansion one at a later date.<br />I'm sorry to say that I have no idea about the water resistant part. It isn't *extremely* easy to read but the numbers are big enough, and I personally wouldn't gift it because it's not modifiable(as per the *Rate Features*).<br />Overall, however, I still like it and wear it everyday."
4.0,"This dress is so cute. I absolutely love it. The only thing that’s kinda lame is how hard it is to button it up. It’s like the holes don’t match the button size so it takes some patience to get them all buttoned up. Other than that it’s awesome. Really cute, good quality, but only 4 stars since it kinda hurt my fingers!"
4.0,"I keep my dog’s tags on this, and it was great for a couple of weeks. It started to get loose and the tags would come off. It may be my dog picking at it, but I would hoping it would be more durable."
4.0,Go Jaguars!!
4.0,Very high quality bag. Wish they also came in black tho.
4.0,"The skirt itself was great. Real denim and not one of those flimsy, cheap knock offs that just look like denim. These are sturdy and perfect. However, the sizing was horribly off. I’m 4’11, my waist line is around 24-26. The smallest size is supposed to have fit me, but this was just terribly big. Too loose around my waist, and ended up too big as well around the bottom of the skirt. Also, the color is way lighter in the pictures on the site. I got the lightest clolored one and it still looked like dark denim. This might be cute on a taller person, but should the skirt have been tailored to suit smaller people, then I wouldn’t have any complaints. It’s a mystery why some people say this runs too small."
4.0,"This is my first time trying toe socks/yoga socks, and I love them. They're surprisingly comfortable and great for the Eczema on my feet. They help keep the moisture away from in between the toes. I do wish that the ankle portion fit better. It's tight on the front of my ankles."
4.0,The necklace was awesome but the not all the light worked on the hat
4.0,Beautiful Sweater...and the fit was on point.
4.0,"When you put them on the watch the pattern is upside down, otherwise like it just fine."
4.0,"Buen material, pero me quedó un poco pequeño para ser XL"
4.0,"It fitted perfect on my AIX watch i have, colors do stand out alot from the image online, but sometimes it seems the dark brown looks more like purple than brown."
4.0,"I like the colors and the overall fit, but I wish they were longer."
4.0,"Received these today.  I received 81 pcs, however, 1 was so badly scratched up I can’t use it.  I wouldn’t necessarily describe this as “quality”, but I got what I paid for."
4.0,"I love the look of the bag and it is pretty well made. I've had it for about 5 months and it's already tearing on the center insert, so that's the reason for 4 stars. Otherwise it looks very elegant and is a great purchase for the price."
4.0,"I bought a pair for tie dying and they took the dye beautifully. I’m 5’1”. They tie at my belly button, over my hips, at my natural waist. The length would come to the floor, but the cuff at the bottom stops that. I ordered an xl, when I usually wear a medium in American sizing. These fit my too large waistline comfortably, with lots of room in the pants. I dyed a cotton tunic from India at the same time (along with some canvas high tops.) I love my new outfit and get lots of compliments on it. So comfortable and cool. Another reviewer described how air seems to flow through and cools you down. Very accurate. These pants are perfect for summer. I doubt they’d be good for winter. We’ll see.<br /><br />I find that foreign sizing often runs small, so I really lucked out finding a shirt that actually fits my short, little t-Rex arms 🤗<br /><br />I immediately ordered more pants to dye, and a black pair. Unfortunately, shipping is taking forever ⏳would give five stars, if it wasn’t for the very long wait to get them."
4.0,As patriotic as it is comfortable it does this old veteran proud to once again be associated with Old Glory.
4.0,"These fit really well. The waistband is great, because it doesn’t cut into you or roll up. My only complaint is that I would have liked slightly more compression around the feet and ankles."
4.0,I just love it it's such a cute piece and I'm going to get a lot of compliments and I'm glad I got an extra large because I'm a 42 double d
4.0,I would order a size bigger than what you need
4.0,Good fit. Nice material. True to size.
4.0,"I liked the wallet a lot and had enough pockets for the various things that I need. the magnet on the money clip was also strong enough to hold some bills.  the only dislike, which is why I gave this wallet four stars, was that the Crazyhorse leather is a little light compared to the Amazon pictures. I put some leather lube on it to condition it and also to darken it."
4.0,Very pretty.  I returned them for a bigger size.  I order the wrong size.  Everything g I have ordered from your company is gorgeous.
4.0,"Sent on time, good size."
4.0,The body of the dress fit very nice but the sleeves bothered me a bit because they didn't seem long enough. I found myself constantly trying to pull<br />them down to my wrist.
4.0,"Loved all these, except one pair came in 2 different sizes."
4.0,stylish and comfy shoe
4.0,Skirt runs large.
4.0,"Really cool watch! But the wrist band part was really cheap. Other than that it's classic and cool. I would get it, people love it."
4.0,"Good value for the price, they do run a little big."
4.0,This top is very comfy and soft. Would not wear it in heat though because it feels like it would be hot despite being pretty thin. Just think the poly would make it hot. Comes below the bum area and is flowy.  It runs large IMO. I wear a 1X in most tops with a little room as I don't like snug fitting clothes. The 1X (XL) in this top is a little too big across the chest and tummy area. I would suggest sizing down one size.
4.0,"My grand daughter, who is a &#34;tween&#34; loved this.  I am sure it will be a favorite, at least for a while!"
4.0,"Love the sweatshirt, but it seems a bit small to be a 2X"
4.0,Cute on but shows everything not crazy about the material at all
4.0,"Just a bit small and needs to be stretched a bit. but then again, i am a size 12."
4.0,Easy to install and looks great with my Orient watch.  But a little snug for my 8 inch wrist.
4.0,These sweats are comfortable but shorter than I thought. I got a XL for length and it still is a little shorter.
4.0,I would recommend it my wife love it but it did not fit but she is working her way down.  For a perfect fit..
4.0,I love it......
4.0,"It's as i remember, just a bit small for my wrist. However, i'm going to use it for the beach, so it works just fine"
4.0,"My only suggestion would be to hand wash and hang to dry.  I have a washer with no agitator, washed on delicate in cold water and it is already starting to get pilly. I don't put these in the dryer, I hang them to dry."
4.0,"Very nice dress.  A little tight in the bust.  I'm 5'9' and usually wear a size 6. But, overall it was a very well made, nice dress."
4.0,"Overall I really like these pants, however they are way too tight."
4.0,Well I DO LOVE THESE except got MINT (LIGHT GREEN) and NOT including the PINK WHICH WAS IN FACT the Only reason I chose this set other than relatively reasonable price on 6 pair of arm protectors...or (turkey arm hiders mo like)...<br />..
4.0,Some broke really easily
4.0,"loved it, came quick and seems to be good quality"
4.0,"Kinda hard to switch out lenses at first, takes some getting used to, but love all the options! Looks good on a woman, I only use them for biking, very sporty, very versatile!"
4.0,Bretty gud
4.0,Decent necklace and earrings for the price
4.0,"Somewhat large in size but what a cute swimsuit!! It was easy to alter the shoulder straps to get a better fit but the body is a little long. I'm 5' 2&#34;! I haven't used the swimsuit in water yet so I don't know how it will perform but it's comfortable, modest and very flattering."
4.0,"Size dow on this one a little loose, but great quality."
4.0,They are not as long as advertised. They slip down to only come up to the knee. Don't recommend them if you are looking for above the knee compression socks. Other than that they are good.
4.0,"The material is nice, soft, and drapes nicely, only thing is it is toooo long. I don't use the necklace, it looks cheapy even tho it came as a set. Garage sale should be an item for the person who might be interested in it."
4.0,The shirt is very nice but too small
4.0,"Sweater is very soft, but it's oddly large.  Purchase a size down."
4.0,These are great.  They fit good.  Pockets are a plus!
4.0,These are worth the money!!
4.0,"I love these spirals, I just wish they were individually labeled as to which size is which. Other than that they are a great deal."
4.0,So far this has been a good quality bead.  It looks beautiful!  I've been concerned about ordering beads with stones but none have fallen out so far.
4.0,Both stylish and functional!
4.0,I love these and I love the fact that they came in so many colors. The only thing that is problematic is they are a bit hard to close but once they are closed at least you don't have to worry about them falling out.
4.0,Felt just like lululemon
4.0,"Pretty, but runs a little small"
4.0,"I love the color. I always wear a medium but this medium is a little large. The back is a longer than I expected, but it is a pretty shirt."
4.0,Cute.  Got it as it's something great-grandpa used to say.  It says 6-12 months on the advertisement.  I'd say much closer to the 9-12month range and less 6-month.
4.0,"The skirt is a bit short, the socks keep sliding off, and the gloves are a tiny bit big, but other than that, everything else fits well"
4.0,"I wish that the upper, shorts portion of the pants were shorter and there was more netting or the pants started higher up. The inseam is longer than it looks in the photo. I am 5'5&#34; and they are just long enough for me."
4.0,Great color. Nice a light. True to size.
4.0,"I like these belly rings, but they don't look exactly like the picture. The glitter that creates the opal effect is unevenly distributed throughout the stone, so it's not as sparkly on one side. The surgical steel has not irritated my skin at all. Overall, I think they're a good value."
4.0,Great so far. I ordered 22G and it seemed a skittle large. I’ve had 1 bar in for about a month and the stone is still intact - that’s always a plus! The rose gold is subtle but nice - it matches my other rose gold jewelry very well!
4.0,These sun glasses look great.  They are light weight and use springy wire which makes them very comfortable to wear for long periods of time.The mirror finish was perfect and devoid of imperfection.  I would give a 5 star if there was a slight coating of plastic or vinyl at the ends of the supports.
4.0,Fit great. looked great
4.0,It's a nice shirt with good quality. Just a bit shorter than expected.
4.0,thick enough.
4.0,The dress was very pretty but too tight in the bustline. I'm ordering a larger size to see if it will fit.  Sizes are not correct.  Loved the dress though.
4.0,This set of necklaces is a nice price and comes with quite a few. It'd be nice if they had more character variety in the designs but they look great overall. I wear different ones to match my outfits. Would recommend to MHA fans! Note: The necklace chains are a bit long.
4.0,"Well worth the money, easy biness"
4.0,I purchased to use for wedding in July
4.0,I am curvy and this still looked really boxy
4.0,"liked the feel and color, a little baggier than i like, but very comfortable."
4.0,These have worked well and seem to be holding up.
4.0,Looked nice and fit correctly
4.0,It must be my belly. They are. Nice. Just slowly make their way done under my tummy.
4.0,I bought red color but it's teeth actually more tangerine . Otherwise looks nice.
4.0,"Nice suit, holds up well, however fits weirdly in trunk area. Too much fabric. However, covers private areas perfectly well. Daughter likes it. I appreciate adjustable straps. Will likely be able to fit next year as well."
4.0,"Cute and priced just right, but it was smaller than anticipated. Very narrow cut, definitely size up!"
4.0,Such a cute earring! I wear it all the time! Love it! Simple and cute cute cute! I recommend it!
4.0,"I love this shirt, but I underestimated the size I needed, LOL. I got a large and yep, it fits like a large. I would have been much more comfortable with an XL but that's on me. I haven't washed it yet so the jury is still out on if or how much it will shrink. The material feels nice enough and I can imagine it will get better when washed."
4.0,Nice set but I thought it looked a bit cheap.  It looked nicer on the picture.
4.0,"Pros:<br />I have chunky legs so when I found this romper with the attached flowing dress, I was so happy!  It runs a bit large, but in my case it worked better and not too tight anywhere.  Easily covers all my unsightly parts. :D<br /><br />Con:<br />The print is really big and a bit outdated so it really brings a lot of attention to you if you're on the larger size.  But I still give it 5 stars for comfort and fit."
4.0,"Its a pretty earring! Just like the picture. Too big for tragus piercing, may be will be nice to a helix one. I am not sure about the quality. My Tragus is not totally healed, I’ll probably wait to try it."
4.0,The bracelet was a little too big for my 10 year old granddaughter’s wrist.
4.0,This was purchased for my great grandson.
4.0,Good product but not quite as detailed as original issue.
4.0,Goot fit!
4.0,"Beautiful, good quality but I have to fix the waist as it was loose!"
4.0,I love it! The picture is misleading though because the zipper part shows white and mine was red.
4.0,Lots of compliments on this shirt! I love how its a little on the longer side so you appear thinner! Huge fan of this top!!
4.0,Does what it is suppose to do ok.
4.0,"I wasn't expecting much for the price. But it's great. Its exactly what the picture shows and its cute. My son is chunky so i sized up and it fits him great. The neck opening is kinda big, but thats the only complaint. 5 bucks? Why not lol."
4.0,Bought a 2xl and it is a little smaller than expected but still comfortable. I won’t be putting this outfit in the dryer. This is exactly what I have been looking for to wear to my kids sports events and out for errands. Will definitely be ordering more!
4.0,These pants are super soft and comfortable but very warm!
4.0,It will be perfect if there's a slot for water bottle
4.0,Great value fir $
4.0,"I always wash my clothes after purchase and before wearing. I knew that linen would shrink, so I washed in cold and air-dryed. It's still a bit big, but the shirt itself is comfy and attractive.<br /><br />To me, a long-sleeve shirt (even a linen one) is too warm in summer, but if you're just bumming around, this is a great option."
4.0,"A very cute dress, however it is a bit small in the bust.  I ordered a M and as a 34D, the chest is a bit tight and I get a bit of separation between the two sides on the buttons, so I pinned them together.  I get lots of compliments when I wear this dress."
4.0,This is a nice beater watch for the price.  It seems to hold the time quite well too. Don't expect much out of the band.  It's thick and only resembles real leather.
4.0,"I guess it fits true to size and it's lovely, but you would need to size up if your boobs are on the bigger side. I am ordering a medium, but this one has to go back."
4.0,"Very cool shades, the blue and white pop in person just as pictured. The rope detailing on the arms are stylish. Inspection of all the little details on these shades give a sense of high-end eyewear.<br /><br />Comes with a micro velvet soft shades bag that could double as a cleaning cloth, and a protective shade case that is a bit stylish in itself. Invicta has this eyewear model in other color-ways but I think these are the flyest' I've seen. I shopped around for a month and it seems this seller has the best price.<br />I gave 4 out of 5 because this model was a little tight on the bridge of my nose compared to others, but I had not made any adjustments to them. I have a masculine Jewish/Black type nose, so someone with a very wide nose bridge may find these uncomfortable. I personally think all shades should come in 2 or 3 sizes."
4.0,"Cute little earrings - good value for the money, but they are definitely kid-oriented costume jewelry"
4.0,I love the colors! Fabric has a nice swing to it.
4.0,The sleeve is short but can still be worn
4.0,"I bought if for my 17 yr old nephew. He loved it. It looks great on him. The only thing he complained about is that it seems to collect a lot of lint. Other than that , he loves it. Wears it every day."
4.0,The fabric is a little thinner than expected. A cross between sweatshirt and T-shirt fabric. I am 5-2” 135lbs and ordered a medium. It fits perfect. I may order another in large just to have that oversized comfy feel. Overall I am happy with this purchase.
4.0,"Very nice material and quality, but the only problem I have is that to me it looks like one of the legs is just slightly longer than the other one but not so much that I wouldn’t wear them again"
4.0,"Super cute, vibrant skirt.  The fabric is thin/see through as other reviewers said.  I wear a slip under it and it's fine."
4.0,Quality is equal to the price<br />About as good as it gets for $23
4.0,To start it was a little small. However it did get the job done. I wear this under my heavy coat.
4.0,I'm a x-small and it was still a little big. Material was a little thin. But super cute!
4.0,I gave it a 4 star as it took a couple of weeks to arrive.  I use these to put on ornaments I make.
4.0,Very soft material. Top is a bit short but very cute. I would buy another set if they had more in different colors
4.0,"I am 5’2” so this dress is about 6” too long. No problem to shorten. Fabric is stretchy & comfortable, a casual look. I gave it 4 stars because it looks “quickly” made, stitching & seams not even."
4.0,Nice thick material. Removed the silly bow tie myself. Only drawback for new is how the bust is cut. Gapping at button area on busty women
4.0,"You may want to size up.  I usually wear a 6 in street shoes, got the small, and I would definitely not want them any smaller!"
4.0,Loved the dress but had to have some alterations done as the back tie straps were uneven and was missing a loop. Also had to add a snap to hold the cover under the tie in place. I'm 112pds 32DDD and bought a small
4.0,"The color, size and quality are great. The only thing I don't like is that the straps with buckles are not leather.  They do not stay fastened."
4.0,This was a gift for my daughter-in-law and she liked it!
4.0,They arrived on time and in good condition. Wore the the past 2 nights and found them to be effective.
4.0,It's looks good
4.0,It is a little to small for normal size checks. I varely got mine in to it. It is very soft well made and nice. It just needs to be a little bigger. It also is bends very easy so you have to kinda watch where you put it so the checks do not get bent up but still really nice
4.0,"I loved this t-shirt and was sad to return it - but I'm not into the skin-tight look, and even though I ordered a large, it was skin tight. For reference, I'm 5'8, 135 lbs, 34A bra, broad shoulders."
4.0,Love this! More of a maroon color also the bows fray but that can or fixed with fire or fabric glue.
4.0,They seem to be made well enough and would be comfortable for a toddler. But calling these ‘kids’ headphones is definitely a misnomer. A more accurate label would be ‘toddler noise canceling headphones’. These were way too small for my 7 year old daughter.
4.0,I normally wear a s/m but based on the reviews I ordered a large and it fit perfect. It's a super cute dress it just has no stretch at all. I still like it and even ordered another in a different color.
4.0,I really like this cape - it looks great with jeans. Or can be worn for more formal event.<br />It is fairly lightweight (and not lined) so it is best for chilly but not freezing temps.
4.0,Great boots. Looks so snazzy too!
4.0,This car is very nice quality. The red color is nice and vibrant and there are no snags in a yarn. It is very warm and I like that it provides full coverage and you can fold it multiple ways. Will be great for the Winter.
4.0,"The colors are beautiful and the material is soft and comfortable, however way too short."
4.0,"Pros - Cute shoes, look like the picture, great beachy gladiator feel<br /><br />Cons - Very difficult to get on and off; not something you could just slip on. The laces don't slide through the holes well so it takes quiet a bit of adjusting.Also, the heel is open and the zipper starts above the heel so taking it off was hard as I can't get a very good grip."
4.0,"Nice thick cotton.<br />True color.<br />Head and neck bands loop through one side for adjusting.<br /><br />Nose band is heavy.<br />Air ventilates through the sides so, when paired with a thick hat, one's ability to breath is impacted.<br /><br />Wore for an 8 hour shift today, not my favorite."
4.0,"Wife is 5'4"" and the cover up is pretty short. It does cover everything for the most part, and looks really cute when just wearing to the beach/swimming. She would probably want something a little longer if she was going to wear it to an ice cream shop or convenience store after swimming though."
4.0,larger cut makes for a better fit around nose even without a metal nosepiece
4.0,"A very beautiful bracelet, but it looks so fake and toy like only because it is made too big. It would be great if it is half of the size. But for this price, it is probably just for girls for fun."
4.0,Great sweatshirt. Just don't let the strings touch any velcrow.
4.0,Love the color and size.  Will be especially good for traveling.
4.0,cute boots fit true to size
4.0,Purchased this hat for my son he absolutely loves it. Only concern he’s a child it’s an adult size small so we had to be prepared that it was going to be a little big.
4.0,"I don’t use it to dry off, so I’m not sure how absorbent it is. I love that it is so lightweight and doesn’t make me hot. Only downfall is it is pretty big and I have a flap that sticks out when I pull it tight emotionally stay up."
4.0,Had watch short time but it looks and works great
4.0,"I really like this dress, but I'm not fond of the v style neckline in the back too.  You cant open the front or back. So if you get it too  form fitting, it may be hard to get on."
4.0,"The color is a bit darker than on the picture, but other than that it's a nice dress."
4.0,"Nice quality, fusion is more like a pretty pink. Love it."
4.0,If you want it over sized get at least 1 size bigger.
4.0,This product fit good. I am 5’6 and it didn’t touch the floor. I got a size medium. The fabric is breathable and it isn’t to thick
4.0,I love these modern Catwoman spin on the classic cat frames. They fit me snugly and I have a rather small face so it you have prominent bone structure these may feel a bit too tight. I have a petite frame and face but these work for me if I wear my hair a bit bigger with extra va-va-voom lol. So these aren't everyday glasses but perfect for the right mood and outfit/feline costume.
4.0,Very easy to put on watch
4.0,"Soft material and arms/torso fit well, loose in the neck and didn’t stay up well. Washes well and doesn’t shrink - pretty much true to size"
4.0,I only gave it 4 stars because they were a little bigger than I needed<br />But they work well anyway<br />Great useful product
4.0,It's on the cheap side with lots of threads needing to be trimmed before wearing. But it's super cute. The Bonnet is way too huge but my baby hates hats anyway so no big deal
4.0,Fit well . Wore them in water no problems.
4.0,Cute sparkly pins for small gifts. They aren't amazing quality but are as expected for the price. They sure are pretty. I attached them to warm fuzzy gloves for small gifts at Christmas time.
4.0,"okay, I was impressed. Very simple but it was beautiful! I wore spanks with it because it does show the stomach since it’s a thin material."
4.0,Very beautiful and catch a lot of light like a real diamond would. But still for plating and man made faux gems these are a bit pricey for me in the end. Let's see if they grow one me more. If they do I will spread the word here for any compliments I get on here too. They do seem well made though.
4.0,"Well made, looks great on my dress uniform."
4.0,It’s super nice but don’t understand why is it priced so high. Comfortable and slick looking but not super high end looking. The nomad sign reads upside down. Give you deep pockets and like the look then buy it. Otherwise budget should not get it.
4.0,good quality just too small. will need a larger size
4.0,Great product for small ears. Use them on my 2 year old. She is pretty rough and so far they held up. A couple of times they opened but did not fall out of the ear. Great inexpensive option for Sensitive ears.
4.0,Very nice dress for a casual day out. Fitted well...love the dress.<br /><br />Material is not dressy as expected.
4.0,Very pretty and fits nicely.  The dangle part gets twisted up though and I have to fix it several times a day.
4.0,A little big on the face but still cute.
4.0,"A beautiful skirt, but a little snug on me.I loved the material and the feel of it. I would recommend it!"
4.0,Husband likes the casual watch and hooray no more batteries to worry about.
4.0,Well constructed. Comfortable. Good for gym or casual wear. 33/34 inch waist ordered a large.
4.0,I love the fitting of this dress. But it’s too big for me!
4.0,This is a very comfortable beanie cap and the speakers work great.  It keeps the head warm and you can listen to music without having annoying earbuds in your ear!  The speakers are placed nicely over the ears and the battery lasts for a long time as well.  Thank you for reading and i hope you found this helpful!
4.0,"Somewhat short, but an pretty good dress for the price."
4.0,If you want it to look like the picture order it bigger than you would think to. Cute material though.
4.0,I loved the pants but I would definitely go up one size pants that you regularly wear.
4.0,It fits well and material is as I expected a little short but I am tall
4.0,"Super cute dress, good quality material. Does run a little big in the chest area, fits good in the waist and is the perfect length, right above my knees. I'm 5'7 135lbs 36B"
4.0,Great glassed for a great price.
4.0,It was nice but just too short for me.
4.0,The only thing some of the materiel is paste that is why gave 4 stars.
4.0,"I have a number of Myra bags which I love. Although this bag does have a zipper, just be aware it does not zip from end to end so it is not completely securely closed. I would not check this bag when flying and it is too large to fit under your seat. It is still a great weekend bag if you are driving."
4.0,There's cut corners and the clip could be a bit bigger
4.0,Cute but very short~I am only 5'3 so I thought it would be fine~~Just to short
4.0,"Love this cute little dress. Only complaint.... WHY ARE ALMOST ALL DRESSES SOLD ON AMAZON SO SHORT????? It's not just me who has this issue. I see other ppl com;plaining about this all of the time too. What's up with that AMAZON???? And trust me, I am SHORT at only 5'2,' 120 lbs thin and small frame, 34C, so I can't even imagine how short it would be on a taller girl. I can't bend over without showing my bum in this thing.  I just make sure I wear cute boy shorts underneath and it's fine."
4.0,I love this shirt it does stretch I'm 51 years old and don't like anything tight to this was good. However it would actually be tight if I ordered the right size. This is confortable and fun. Quality of the material is good and didn't fall apart in laundry a plus
4.0,"I have purchased directly from Romans in the past so am familiar with the fit of their tops.  I would say that this is true to size.  I purchased this for my Mom, who's in a nursing home and had it shipped directly to her so I can not comment on how it looks, other than it looked good in the photo."
4.0,Worth purchasing
4.0,"Based on other reviews I was expecting a cheaply made cover up but I'm happy with my purchase. It's not the best quality but it is still a very cute cover up. The color is more of a beige type color, a bit darker than the picture. I also read it ran small so I was nervous I didn't order a larger size but it fit fine. I usually wear a large in shirts and am 5'7&#34; and I ordered the medium. If you want it more loose and flowy then order a size up, it was still flowy on me. I paired this kimono with a nice dress for a wedding, I got tons of compliments."
4.0,Feels nice but ran small
4.0,"I never thought I could have a shirt with too many pockets -- until I tried this one.<br /><br />Aargh -- the bottom two pockets necessitate wearing the shirt outside your pants.<br /><br />No good for suspender wearers like myself!<br /><br />Otherwise, the fabric is a nice lightweight linen, and I like the blue color.<br /><br />The fit is fine -- I wear a size-16 shirt, and this shirt in large does the job -- but the finish could be a little better; I found a fair number of loose threads.<br /><br />Nevertheless, if you're an ""outies"" wearer in need of a nice lightweight casual button-down shirt with four pockets -- you might really like this item."
4.0,"The product was here on time , came wrapped in plastic and looks real. The only issue is it’s very difficult to put on without hurting / pinching your nose and leaving a mark."
4.0,Very soft and fits perfectly. Arm holes are not to baggy and the v neck isn’t saggy
4.0,"Great disposable lake sunglasses.  I have 5 pairs of these (had 6).  No huge loss if the sink to the bottom or an inebriated friend sits on them.  I always have a spair.  Great deal, fit nice, look good."
4.0,Best wallet I've ever had.  Compact but holds everything - with pockets to spare. Slips right into my purse with no hassle.<br />Cons:  Has a slight musty smell that has not dissipated over several months. Small coins slip into the folds at the edge of the coin purse and fall out when it's opened. (You will learn to watch for them as you open the coin section.)<br />I love this wallet because I'm finally organized without tugging at a large &#34;organizer.&#34;
4.0,Serves its purpose but it is a little too noisy for the office.  It’s #1 purpose is to remind the wearer to tighten the abdominal muscles.  If the abdominal muscles become relaxed the unit vibrates if adjusted appropriately.  I have separated abdominal muscles from 2 c-sections.  This thing helps but I’ve not been very committed to wearing it.  I also tried it while running but couldn’t feel the vibration while on a run.
4.0,It’s cute but fabric is not dressy at all..
4.0,"UPDATE:  Seller quickly contacted me to resolve the issue.  Apparently too the first few times you wear the sleeves they will feel extra tight and it should feel better after that.<br /><br />ORIGINAL REVIEW:<br />Does not fit at all and very poor quality.<br /><br />The seam already coming undone and fraying when I took it out of the package.<br /><br />I have 14.25 inch biceps, the large that is supposed to fit arms up to 16.5 inch was way too tight. I could barely get it up past my forearm.  When I did it was painfully tight, basically cutting off circulation."
4.0,"I got this dress for my wife since it looked like a cute and casual clothing item.  The color is a deep navy blue; quite lovely.  The fabric is a soft blend of cotton and polyester.  It is a comfortable dress and has pockets which are a handy feature.  She will likely wear this dress with tights and boots.  It could also pair well with a thin pair of leggings.  This is a cute, casual dress."
4.0,"The dress is pretty, just as advertised, it feels too big at the top, the small stated bust to be 35.... while my bust is 36 yet it has bulge at the back meaning it is too big, the short sleeve is not fitted. Kinda flared, the fabric is light making the dress too casual,  if you want that &#34;dressed up&#34; look then wear a petticoat like I did in the picture. Overall the dress is beautiful for the price. I am 5:3, 36,29,39, I ordered a small."
4.0,This is a cute shacket to pair with jeans or leggings. It’s warm enough to wear with a long sleeve underneath. I like the way it feels and fits.
4.0,"ADORABLE. Really loved the style, and the shipping was quicker than expected as well. The sizes do run a little small though. I ordered a small and ususally wear around a size 2 in pants/shorts and thought they could have allowed a litte more room. The material is also fairly thin adn delicate, not sure it will hold up well in the wash."
4.0,Strong sun glare surprised me.
4.0,Very nice and soft but no support
4.0,posts are a little too fat for my ears.
4.0,These are very comfortable sunglasses that seem well built and will most likely last a long time if I don't loose them first.
4.0,Definitely looks like the picture. Nice material. Just a little small. Would have been nice to be an inch larger. It gets lost on a jacket.
4.0,Good quality but not great. My daughter really likes it though.
4.0,I have really small feet so these were kind of large on my foot but with socks I think they'll be ok.<br />Sad part is that my family found these shoes in our yard with the packaging all ripped up. I'm assuming a dog chewed the packaging and the shoes. The UPS left the shoes on our front porch and we did not have a chance to get them before a dog did. I was really upset. I may have to get another pair. Just be careful if you have dogs in your neighborhood. DO NOT let the UPS leave them at your front door.<br />The shoes are very light weight and comfortable for everyday use. I recommend them.
4.0,Love it - material was better than I expected<br />I have not washed it yet
4.0,"Liked the quality & Fit.  whish there were more to it like the saying ""Rock On""  and maybe something small on the back?"
4.0,Didn't realize it was going to be HUGE so be sure to look at the demensions
4.0,tight around the calf's a little. if you have bigger legs. these might not work.
4.0,"Fit good, a tad bit large. Would rather it be larger than smaller."
4.0,"The buckle is a little difficult to use, but otherwise, everything else about this belt is fine."
4.0,"Material different than expected and somewhat see through, but for the price I love it! Comfortable fit and looks adorable."
4.0,Really like this sweater.  Will be wearing it for the holidays
4.0,"They’re cute for the price. I wasn’t paying attention when I ordered, and didn’t see there was an option for hearts or round stones, so I ended up with hearts (which there is only a photo of the round stones) and I was expecting round stones, but that was an overlook on my part. Unfortunately the stones are loose in a couple of them so I’m going to have to send them back.  Would’ve been 5-stars if the stones weren’t loose in multiple different colors to where there isn’t a single set that I can wear."
4.0,"I bought this hat as a Christmas gift for my sister. She's worn it almost every day since and said it keeps her head warm, BUT she did say the pom pom fell off. Apparently it was fairly easy to reattach, but it's worth mentioning."
4.0,"Very soft and sheer, however I wear a Men's 10.5 shoe and these socks are small on me.  I can barely get them to my ankle let alone above it."
4.0,Loved this suit for my daughters birthday. 3T ran a little small and some thread was hanging from the bottom. Other than that it was great quality.
4.0,Could have been a bit longer.
4.0,Nice feel and look
4.0,"Plus size, is lightweight runs smaller . Looks nice"
4.0,Great under swim dress
4.0,"Good fit, nice colors.. undecided whether I'll keep it or not because it cuts off at a weird place on me personally. The bottoms aren't high waisted as advertised, but they aren't hipsters either. So yeah, debating on what I'll do..."
4.0,"Aside from the expected obstruction of my field of view and a slight discomfort after wearing the mask for an extended period of time, there is nothing negative to say about this mask. It fit well, was easy enough to be tied behind my head by myself and stayed in place while walking (I didn't try to dance with it)."
4.0,"Size ran a little large, but otherwise was good"
4.0,Very flexible yet durable
4.0,No metal nose thing
4.0,didn`t like the fabric
4.0,"This was a little short for me to wear as a dress. I am 5'10"". Nothing that a pair ofnleggings can't fix though! It is very light and pretty see through. Be sure to wear a lifht colored bra or tank top underneath."
4.0,This dress was perfect in design and fabric but for me the colors were too bright. It had ALOT of orange! More yellow and  I maybe could have lived with. It was bright orange!  I’m so bummed . I’d buys this in every other color but there are none.
4.0,"This is my second time buying these exact earrings. I’ve worn stick earrings before and am aware of the fact it’s unconventional and can poke you from the back. I mean, if you have an issue with that then don’t buy these but it only pokes if you sleep or lay on them not while you’re actually wearing them out. They’re solid wood so obviously going to be on the heavy side but not heavy enough to hang your whole earlobe down ugly.<br /><br />So the first time I bought THESE, I had to throw them out after a month because they smelled like pure ammonia. I don’t know why because I kept them in a little cotton baggy when I didn’t wear them inside a cabinet and it was the wood that would smell not the baggy I had them in. I tried EVERYTHING to wash the smell off but nothing. I could not wear them without smelling it and it bothering me, I also would have felt insecure that other people could smell that too.<br /><br />But I love the style of these earrings they’re so different and look BOMB on me. I hope this time they don’t smell. I haven’t opened them up yet so we’ll see if it was just the old pair went bad(?) or something! I really have no clue what happened to the old pair that made them smell THAT bad. It was unbearably strong not like regular pee like super duper heavy cat/bum pee like that but if you just had the ammonia part from that pee and soaked it in the earrings. LOL<br /><br />I wonder if this happened with anyone else.<br />Anyways, these are very different and you have to understand how to wear them. They’re very cultural looking and I think it’s just beautifully different."
4.0,I love this....but it's to big.  I'm a size 4....28&#34; waist and 36&#34; hips
4.0,"It's fine, didn't expect it to be shiny like a bathing suit, but it does the job fine. It's polyester/spandex."
4.0,"Great looking shirt. Fits slim tho. Nice if you like to push up the sleeves-note the black bands around the wrists-holds it in place well. Looks very nice on my son, he's 17 and likes something a little bit novel in the way of clothes."
4.0,Nice design as expected
4.0,I need to return it due to not being the same brand as my fit bit.
4.0,"Great quality bag for under $15, has an inside open pocket. a great gift for a Seinfeld lover"
4.0,"The shoe fabric/structure is a little stiff and tight, not as pliable as some shoes we've found. Even with the velcro straps, it's hard for my toddler to put them on herself. She love Peppa, though, so we make it work."
4.0,"Overall I'm very happy with these charms. The material is stainless steel and the detailing looks great. Only issue I have is that some of the charms are pretty scratched up. Not so much that they are unusable, but something to keep in mind if you're going to buy."
4.0,Great product.  Longer than I liked.  Easy and quick transaction.
4.0,"Super cute bag, ive already gotten several compliments.  I love the multiple pockets,  helps to keep things organized so you dont have to rummage around looking for things. I love the material and the color matches the picture. I took off 1 star for the middle pocket zipper. It does not reach from end to end, but is centered with about an inch on each side left open. I can work with that by only putting larger items in that pocket."
4.0,"Good size and quality. I had a smaller one that I bought at a fair but I gave it to my mom so she could carry her phone and small wallet while at work. This replacement was of same quality but a bit bigger with more pockets for me to a put phone, small wallet, lipstick and keys."
4.0,"These are beautiful! A little chunky and thick  for my taste, but looks great on."
4.0,Fit really well except for around the chest the the spaces inbetween the buttons pooched out a bit and im not that large busted.
4.0,Really cute! Only thing is the material is a little thin but that is expected with the price. Just wear a tank and Spanx/tights under it and super cute!
4.0,Granddaughters fell in love with this.
4.0,"The bottoms have a lot of cushion, almost too much for my toddler but, I hope with a little wear they will flatten down enough that it won't be an issue any longer. Other than that they seem well made and the colors are vivid."
4.0,"I ordered 2 skirts, the black/white and red/black. I got a red/black and a navy. I ended up keeping the navy as it's cute but it was not what I ordered. The red/black one I got has a broken zipper so I'll be returning it. All in all though the skirts look good and are comfortable and true to size if you actually measure your waist. Does sit a bit high on the hips (at least for me) and has silk shorts attached which I wasn't expecxting but appreciated after witnessing the length of the skirt firsthand."
4.0,"About what you would expect from 10 dollar sunglasses.  Not great quality, but holding together well through quite a bit of wear and tear.  For the price I would say they are hard to beat, but definitely don't compare with Smiths, etc."
4.0,Bit smaller then expected but OVERALL GREAT LOVE IT
4.0,Like the material nice fit not to bulky
4.0,"My husband has been mostly pleased with this rain suit. He's a paramedic, so sometimes he has to work in the rain and even on the side of the road. Not only does this suit keep him dry, but the colors will help make sure he's seen by others, hopefully preventing another accident. The jacket has a breathable back, so it's not too hot. There's elastic on the wrists. That part is too tight for him, but otherwise, it's been handy and useful to have around."
4.0,"I really like these overall shorts.  The fabric lays nice and is light and breezy.  You can adjust the straps with a button in the back.  These are so great for summer.  It’s much cooler to wear than shorts and a T-shirt.  I usually wear a size medium but I thought I would like it oversized.  Now that I tried it on, I think medium would have been fine.  I’m 5’3” and 130 lbs."
4.0,Cute but easy to misplace. Slippery on hands. Keep it safe.
4.0,Love that they are rechargeable and not heavy with batteries. They work great and always get compliments!
4.0,"Pros:<br />I received the product today, it got here safely, and packaged with another product I ordered. It got here quickly, and in perect condition. I love how it looks, and feels. No flaws.<br />The cons:<br />I have big wrists, therefore the bracelet is a little tight. I won't be able to wear it a whole lot unfortunately, until it cuts off circulation. So, I am using it as a decoration for my keychain.<br />Overall I am happy with the product, I would like to see if the company comes up with a size chart for different sized people."
4.0,I wanted to love this tank top but it’s kind of cropped.<br />If this tank top is about 2 inches shorter than I would like it to be for it to be comfortable for me to wear.<br />It covers the top of my high waisted workout pants when I’m standing still but not if I raise my arms up.<br />The arm holes are larger which I don’t mind.<br />The material is soft and the shirt is comfortable.<br />I just wish it was about 2 inches longer.
4.0,Great beanie :) good quality
4.0,Have not worn these yet so can&#34;t give them five stars.  They are beautiful bracelets.  They look like sterling silver.
4.0,I love the outfit and its really long will have to hem it just a bit
4.0,Sun glares on the clear frame. That's really all that is wrong with them.
4.0,Dress was too big
4.0,I was worried about ordering a medium; but it worked out nicely.
4.0,"Good quality, heavy fabric, not see through."
4.0,2 pairs were for amazing the other 2 were very cheap but good for the price
4.0,I just got this watch and I'm very pleased with the quality of it. It didn't cost a lot and looks very modest.
4.0,"The style is unique and gorgeous, it's a beautiful top. Some of the lace is (purposely) detached and hangs somewhat oddly, but other than that i love it"
4.0,"I have very sensitive ears and I prefer to keep my earrings in most of the time rather than taking them in and out frequently. I typically wear 24 kt white gold earrings but I bought these to try as a less expensive alternative. They do not irritate my ears and the backs are tight so the earrings don't fall out. I have 3 piercings in my earlobes and the sizes work well together, although I do actually wish they were smaller. I think if they were smaller they would more realistically imitate actual diamonds. Also my long hair gets caught up in them because they are a little too big."
4.0,"This is a very cute dress.  Made of cotton and stitched very well.  The fit was a little smaller than I expected and I should have ordered up a size, however, I'll use it as incentive to lose a little around the middle!"
4.0,Pretty necklace! I like the size of the bar and the cubic zirconia are sparkly. The chain is decent and feels strong. It gives you extra loops so you can adjust the length. Lobster clasp is strong. Overall this is a nice necklace! Comes with a pouch and box so it will make a nice gift!
4.0,I ordered the blue its a very bold blue. I got a large it fit good I normally wear medium but this fit was just as good
4.0,It's so chic but the chain is very fragile... I always get compliments with this necklace.
4.0,"I think these are the cheapest brand name watches you can buy in the US. Yet they're durable and seem to be reliable. Water resistance is real and it can be kicked around and banged about without breaking.<br /><br />LED illumination is weak, not like newer watches that glow aqua throughout the face. And LED readout doesn't have the crisp, high contrast readout of newer watches. This design came out around 1990 and I don't think they have updated the technology in any way, for good and bad.<br /><br />I recommend it because it's so unobtrusive and cheap to buy. But the more expensive models are easier to read and do have better night illumination."
4.0,Fabric is thinner than I expected. Other than that fits great looks great.
4.0,"not quite what i expected, thought it was going to be a light sweater type cardigan, is instead a type of almost shirt material. fine and perfect for a 2nd layer it was likely my own misunderstanding as a male buying clothes for a female but it fit as expected, she likes it, and my understanding of womens clothes just expanded.  i would buy again"
4.0,The zipper pocket in the bottom is perfect for ballet shows and jazz shoes. Bag is perfect size for my 6 year old daughter to carry on her own.
4.0,"Awesome top, get lots of use out of it.  Looks nice with jeans and dresses up nicely without much effort.  Complimented on it often."
4.0,"I do not like the brand tag at the neckline, so will cut it out. I really like the cotton feel of the fabric."
4.0,So soft feel so warm and cosey love the larger fit!!!
4.0,You may need to order a size bigger for a accurate fit
4.0,"Small stud earrings, but lovely and good quality"
4.0,"This was a really cute dress and I wanted to love it.  The measurements on the size guide were pretty accurate.  I ordered and XL and it fit, but was a little too snug around the waist than I was comfortable with and a bit too loose in the bust to hold the girls up and in.  Note that there is VERY LITTLE give to the fabric between the bust-line and where the ""skirt"" starts."
4.0,It is slim and very simple.
4.0,"Buy a size up.. looks great though, just a really tight fit."
4.0,"Looked great when I first tried it on, but looks different when wet. Doesn't look terrible when wet, just not as pretty!"
4.0,"An attractive stone, but does it repel radiation?"
4.0,"Good socks, but wish they were slight longer."
4.0,These run small. I am typically a medium in tops. I don’t like these skin tight and I ordered a large. Fits great.  Order one size up unless you are super skinny
4.0,I love it but the inside zipper was broken. I'll have to use a little change purse. Other then that its great
4.0,"I like it. I should have gotten a large. But I got an extra large. And the Boobs are a little too big, and I wear a 36DDD. But, other then that. I love the cherry halter top design."
4.0,"The mittens are thick and stylish and did manage to keep my fingers warm for the final weeks of winter. They are larger than I expected. I have small hands and because my fingers can't reach the tips unless I pull the mittens down, I can't really use them effectively on touch screens. More clarity about the size would be helpful, but not a bad product at all for the price. If your hands fit in these gloves, I'm sure you can use the touch screen tips without getting annoyed."
4.0,"For the price, I believe quality is very good, especially with the pewter and detail of Tinker Bell.  Only reservation - wish the blue strap was a little longer.  But a nice gift, stocking stuffer, etc. for those Disney fans on your list....or yourself.  Also, very fast service/quick receipt of product."
4.0,Nice mask for Holidays and parties.
4.0,"Watch is great.  A little snug, but a little overweight.  I like the the look of it."
4.0,Wow! Really nice. Bought this for my husband for Christmas. Arrived one time .
4.0,It does run large but quality was good and if you want a very christmassy dress this is for you. Dress it up and tie on a belt.<br />Instant Merry Christmas🎄😊
4.0,Awesome fit and appearance for the price.
4.0,"Cute dress, more suitable for a shorter person. The waist fit me right under the bust and I know that is not how it is suppose to look. I am busty but this dress has a very short waist if you know what I mean. THE MATERIAL AND QUALITY OF THE DRESS WERE BEAUTIFUL.."
4.0,"Surprisingly sturdy and strong. Amazingly affordable considering they are polarized which is a huge perk. For those who are not familiar with polarized lenses--phone screens will look weird--it is not the fault of the glasses--polarized lenses do this!<br /><br />As far as fit, I have a small face, so I wish they fit a bit better, but this is the case with all sunglasses I purchase."
4.0,"My granddaughter loves theses shoes. They do run a little small. I ordered the next size up in pink, because I think she will outgrow them quickly."
4.0,Costume price a bit high for the quality of its construction. Monkey tail wire became loose from its seam shortly after it was put on. The important thing is that my grandson was happy on his last day of school with the circus theme!
4.0,I bought a size up as recommended by previous reviewers and it fit just right.  very comfortable and excellent quality for the price.
4.0,"I got an XL when I read the other reviews, I usually wear a large. Felt a little tight around my stomach area but it never ripped or stretch out. I love these pants though and always wear them!"
4.0,"I like it is adjustable,  but the same thing I like keeps getting caught in my hair - the tiny gap pulls my hair out"
4.0,"Not the prettiest coat in the world, but fits well, is made well & is lightweight enough so it's comfortable yet warm."
4.0,"I actually liked the material, it kept me cool.  I received many compliments when I wore it to the fireworks show. It did run a little big, I would size down."
4.0,"The band is great, functionally.  The only complaint is that the black color is easily wore off.<br />I am typically not very tough on items but my band is already showing some wear.  Less than a month old."
4.0,I am 3 weeks postpartum and this dress fits alright. I got a large thinking it would be a loose fit but it's snug. Glad I bought a large. It looks cute but I'm still adjusting to this after pregnancy body😊. Comes with a little chocker necklace! I do recommend but would go up a size! I'm 5'5 and about 160lbs.
4.0,"Colors aren't lined up properly on the back side.  It doesn't bother me as much as it could others.  I think it just adds to the uniqueness of the skirt.  Bold colors, on the thicker/heavier side.  Overall, I really like this skirt."
4.0,I ordered a size up to accommodate for Asian sizing and it was a bit too large. I kept it rather than go through the hassle of a return but my regular size would have been perfect
4.0,"I got this for my 1 year old because she hates hats, so I thought I'd try a fluffy soft one to see if she'd like it. Well, she likes to carry it around and likes to wear the scarf (with supervision obviously), but the hat is just way too big. Her 3 year old sister ended up wearing it instead and she loves it. She asks for it even when we're inside. The other downside is that it's somewhat different than the picture, and that along with running so large is why I give it 4 stars instead of 5. It's very soft and warm though, does the trick for the kid it does fit."
4.0,I'm 5'8&#34; so the split was really high on my end. Very cute dress!
4.0,Good quality but tends to run about 1/2 size small.<br />Comfortable wear and pretty durable.
4.0,They are really cute with bright lights. I just wish the lights would last a bit longer.
4.0,Worked great for our vacation in New Orleans.
4.0,"Its very nice confira le and easy to take on and off.<br />Be wear though, due to the magnetic lock it will cause you laptop to turn the screen off!"
4.0,Fits perfectly. Great material!!
4.0,"...in my opinion. Using the sizing chart provided, I ordered a Large. The item that arrived was much too small for me, and, I would guess, for some others fitting the dimensions specified. The garment otherwise appeared to be well made and stylish. Wish I could leave it unrated, but, given this problem, 4 stars is the best I can do."
4.0,Could have been packaged with materials to hold its shape. Otherwise it is very nice.
4.0,Nice hat it's good quality I like the light coloring and mesh in the back great for hot days
4.0,"This is the only thing I can wear. The price is Great,  but they are Super thin. Just make sure your toe nails are cut Really short. They will come through."
4.0,"This shirt is small in the arms, but overall it’s a decent fit. The material is stretchy and thicker than I thought it’d be. It’s also pretty form fitting, I’d suggest a size up."
4.0,Its a great shirt. Feels great and the designed is vibrant. The only issue I have is the character is put low on the shirt. I got a 2xl and he's down by the waist. The picture shows him higher up. Other than that it's a good purchase.
4.0,Great boots for the price. Worth every penny!
4.0,Must have boobs or it won’t work for you it’s a beautiful dress though
4.0,"This is a very pretty necklace. I wasn't sure how the crystals would look in person, but they have a very unique look in the picture online. The design of the necklace is beautiful, but I'll probably give it to my daughter because the crystals did end up looking  a little cheap and more appropriate for a younger person.<br /><br />Likes<br />+ beautiful design<br />+ strong clasp<br />+ nice chain<br />+ beautiful box and great for a gift<br /><br />Dislikes<br />- the multicolored crystals do make the jewelry look cheap<br /><br />I definitely should have chosen one of the other colors. The multicolored crystals were fascinating to me, but in person you can tell they are just a cheap crystal that could never pass as the real thing. Otherwise, with this setting, the necklace would look rather expensive with a plain colored stone.<br /><br />I LOVE the unique look with the silver bars to the side. It also helps to keep the necklace centered and not twisting around your neck or ending up with the clasp in front. The chain is attached to the sides of the silver bar in front. The chain is a pretty nice weight - it's light but doesn't feel like it will break easily. The clasp at the back is strong and hooks easily.<br /><br />The necklaces comes in a beautiful box and would make a great gift. I really love the design overall, but wouldn't recommend the mulitcolored crystals unless it is for someone on the younger side.<br /><br />I received this product for testing purposes. I was asked to be honest in my review - good or bad - to help future buyers. I have no affiliation with the company, did not receive compensation, and all opinions come from my own experience with the product."
4.0,I was very satisfied.  I will order again
4.0,"Pretty decent quality, just remember that the sizes are asian sized. You should size up!"
4.0,bulkier chain than expected but as pictured
4.0,This dress is beautiful and comfortable. It fits as expected giving a bit of compliment to the bust and waist area because of it's design. My only issue is it's a bit of a lint collector so make sure you have a lint brush handy.
4.0,This scarf looks as it is pictured. I love it.
4.0,I'm 5&#34;2 and it seemed to be a kitte big/long but wore it anyways for my vacation.
4.0,Very nice pendent for the money
4.0,"The mask is a little snug, but a little stretching out and you'll be fine. Have in mind there is an opening in the back and a chinstrap, you can cut it to fill your needs. Overall, happy with my purchase. Though I must say, Rubies must up their game with their products."
4.0,Too cute.  Bought these for my son's birthday party and to give out to his classmates on his birthday as well. Great value and the girls loved them.
4.0,its soft and cute. works well and fits great! my kid loves it!!
4.0,I returned this product because they run large. Order a size smaller.
4.0,"It’s beautiful but makes my arms look huge. I think this is a great top for anyone that has inner arms, the really short sleeves are cute but make my arms look huge."
4.0,"Looking good on my 2017 Toyota Sienna, easy installation. Knowledge of electrical is helpful,  wiring long just enough."
4.0,It is nice and washes well.
4.0,"The socks were super long. I am 5'2"" and they went above my knee. The arm coverings fit perfect. The headband was comfortable-not too tight. Perfect accessories for thing 1 or 2 costume"
4.0,Material was nice . the fit could have been a little larger.
4.0,Very nice but a little too big.
4.0,"I bought the original pair for a Christmas gift for daughter.  They didn't fit her, but they fit me.  I kept them and ordered her a larger pair.  And  bonus is the special thumb and forefinger pad that alows you to use the phone without removing the gloves.."
4.0,I normally wear size medium so that's the size I got. It fits but the sleeves aren't as long as pictured. You'll need to order one size up if you want that look. Otherwise it's ok
4.0,very cute but i am 5’0 and 98 pounds and i ordered size small just to be safe but i found it a bit too baggy for my liking. if you are like me i would order xs for future refrence.
4.0,"Pants are not adjustable making it a little hard to find the right size, but great quality. Soft comfy material. Will be a hit with any fornite fan"
4.0,"These socks are very comfortable and that is saying a lot as I hate to wear socks and if I take a pair of socks off I can't stand putting them back on, but that is not the case with these socks.<br /><br />I have to wear compression socks as my feet will swell if I don't, doctors haven't figured out why this occurs, and I had bought these in hopes of them giving enough compression to prevent the swelling. Unfortunately they don't offer enough compression for me. I realize these are athletic compression socks and not medical compression socks but I had hoped getting the smaller size that it would work out. And if I didn't have to wear medical compression socks I would definitely buy more."
4.0,"I bought this for Halloween. The way the bust is cut makes it kind of awkward, you’re always readjusting. Super cute though!"
4.0,"Fit well, good finish on all of them, smaller than I thought they'd be though. They are tinier than standard nose rings you get at Spencer's or Hot Topic. I guess I'll wear them when I need something more subtle for dressy occasions."
4.0,Arm holes a little small
4.0,Cool shirt a little snug for a 2xl wish you had bigger fits but tighter then what i like
4.0,"I bought this skirt for a photo shoot. I'm 5'4&#34;, 165 lbs. I normally wear L/XL clothing and wear pants with a 29-30&#34; waist. I have the post-baby pooch and love handles so I was very concerned about the fit of the skirt. I bought an XL and the elastic is very tight. The length is perfect and will be great even with heels. I would be more comfortable with about an inch more of elastic and I'm debating on returning for this reason. Otherwise it's a gorgeous, flowy skirt!"
4.0,"I had not worn leg-warmers for thirty or more years, and was pleasantly surprised to find these were a very comfortable fit for wearing under mid=weight  jeans but over boot-tops with no strain. I do not need them often enough to buy several pairs, and these hold up to machine washing/drying very well."
4.0,"Fits ok a little small in size, too tight on the back end."
4.0,Good product. Too expensive!
4.0,To wide in the boddes but with a few minor alterations looked great and got lots of compliments.
4.0,"I really like these bands. They are very comfortable on the wrist. One of the bands I received was broken but the seller promptly credit me for it. Individually they are relatively more expensive than buying them in bundle. In a bundle, they almost cost you half a price per band granted you don't have a lot of choices when choosing bundles. As for durability, I wouldn't know. I had them on just a week or so. Anyway, I might buy more for my other watches as well."
4.0,It’s very pretty and feels well made.
4.0,"Great watch for the money.  One item to note, the chronograph second and minute hands do not align.  Although only $35 it should present somewhat accurately."
4.0,"Love the floaty sparkle in the pen. I gave 4 stars bc there was a small crack in the pen when it came, I hope it doesn't continue cracking or I may have to throw it away."
4.0,It is somewhat see thru.
4.0,My son liked them they fitted just right right. Just wished they were thicker.
4.0,Very nice construction and material is decent...basic colors that will fit well with any jacket.
4.0,"My husband is pretty happy with them. I ordered one size larger because the reviews said they run small, and it was true. He said they're not quite as comfortable as others he's had, but they're nice.q"
4.0,My husband loves the charm.  He's a big man and it looks great.  The chain looks great too.  The only problem is sometimes his face and back of the neck hair gets pulled.  The chain is tryin to slowly pluck his hair out.
4.0,Looks like picture. Good packaging.
4.0,"Good price, fast shipping, shorter than I thought but that's my fault."
4.0,"I never had a metal allergy in my life until I bought a few of the silicone sport bands with the large round stainless stud. With every one of them my arm would have a 1-2” diam red irritation within a few days. I tried clear nail polish over the stud, I tried moleskin over it, stick-on foam patches. This all bought me a few days, but then the irritation would come through. But I really really like the sport bands So I just kept putting fresh moleskin on about once a week.<br />When I saw this one with its teeny little hex stud, I decided to take the plunge, and so far so good. I’ve been wearing it continuously for several weeks now. I put a couple of layers of clear nail polish over it first, and I will replenish that periodically but so far it’s working and my arm isn’t red at all. It’s working so well that I ordered a couple of others in different colors.<br />I agree that it’s a little more difficult to put on than other sport bands, but I don’t care. It works. I only take it off and put it on once a day. I can live with that. And the other thing about it that’s annoying is that it is LONG! The extra wraps underneath and all the way under the watch. I solved that by trimming about an inch off the end and that works just fine. But that’s the only reason I downgraded a star. I have a 6” wrist and if you were a 7”, it would fit fine! But I love it, I love the black and the dark blue with the rainbow colored inserts. Super cute! My favorite bands."
4.0,Wonderful. The white isn’t super see through
4.0,"I got an xs as I am normally a size 4/6 - and size 28/29 in jeans -- it is soft  and somewhat light - top and sleeves fit perfectly, bottom is flowing and roomy . . ."
4.0,We added these to my sons Nike Roshe shoes to make them easier to get on. I've learned the hard way with toddlers that if you have to tie the shoe they just don't get worn. Minus one star because the ends of the laces sometimes bother my son. Wish they weren't metal because they are worn inside the shoe (unless I'm doing it wrong?).
4.0,"1. Fits well, just as expected.<br />2. Used for exercise, got good sweat and dried quickly.<br />3. The label is too long, itchy at the neck, had to cut it.<br />4. Wish it has different colors for summertime!"
4.0,"Nice sweater. Fits perfectly. It’s somewhat thin, so I wear long sleeves underneath. But I love the colors and the look."
4.0,very pretty/easy to put on-but also comes undone while wearing
4.0,Boughtt for daughter.  Way to big.  Had to return.  “Dokotoo wome’s open front long sleeve Cableknit Cardigan.”
4.0,Beautiful dress but is too long for me
4.0,"Nice boots, light weight and comfortable. The only thing I didn't like is that they are not really water proof, and the shoestring are really thin."
4.0,"It fits a bit small in the hips and the ties in front of the breasts come loose but for the price it's good. Also, the material is not thin or weak so I expect it will last quite a while."
4.0,"Think material, would be nicer with pockets, however it is super cute! Would buy again!"
4.0,Fits a little on the small side. Had to return and go up 1 size.
4.0,I am very particular about my sunglasses and I would buy these again. My only complaint is that they were shipped in an envelope. Who ships sunglasses in an envelope? So after I bent them back into place they were exactly what I expected for the money I paid.
4.0,Great fit! Comfortable. Love that it has pockets
4.0,It is a nice lightweight knit top.  It is not very &#34;fitted&#34; but rather a slightly loose drape.  Washed nicely in cold water but I hung it to dry. The care label says to dry clean it (which seems like overkill considering the fabric).
4.0,"Confused about why there are questions about shoes associated with this Vera Bradley checkboook cover.  Oh well.  This is a beautiful Vera Bradley product.  As a checkbook cover, it does the job as it is intended.  My only complaint is that the soft sides are incompatible with writing checks or making entries into the register without providing some outside product or using only on a hard surface.  Still, it is beautiful."
4.0,"Looks nice, material good."
4.0,It’s looks better on the picture. It’s mor like a very young girl dress not for women. Cheap look
4.0,I'm pretty happy with this purchase. I just wanted something to keep my neck warm but not have too much arm bulk and this fits the bill.
4.0,"Love them, fits good.<br />But see-thru. Don't wear to grocery store,  lol."
4.0,They are cute looks like a pair of Gucci’s but doesn’t fit my face well
4.0,Very soft soft and cozy.
4.0,"I was looking for a statement necklace and thought this was so pretty, when i received it i still thought it was pretty just not the size i was going for which made me a little upset, but over all its still a very nice necklace"
4.0,Color not as vibrant as the picture but it goes well with my outfits. Very cute
4.0,Great backpack that packs up small.  Used this on trip to bring back extra items.  Worked great and did not add too much weight.
4.0,"Good fit, but really darker than I expected. I was hoping it was closer to Tiffany blue"
4.0,Love it! Great product
4.0,The collar size was not a 16 or 16 1/2. Was like 17 or 17 1/2. Everything else was fine.
4.0,"Like to change watch band color, perfect for me."
4.0,"Very thin so not for warmth, but as expected otherwise."
4.0,"So I had to purchase twice, which was frustrating, but I'm happy with the product.<br /><br />I followed the size guide for the ALICE and they were much too large.  Sadly no free return shipping so cost me $11 to send these back.<br /><br />Got in the size I normally would purchase and they are a perfect fit, no double boob, no pinching.<br /><br />They aren't the best quality bras, I'm sure they won't last me forever, but 6 bras for the price of 1 will work great for me for a while."
4.0,"It's a good dress, well-priced and well-made, but I'm not head over heels, 5 star in love with it.<br /><br />I don't have a straight/boxy figure at all (35-29-41), but this dress made me look very boxy--and not in a good, slimming, tall rectangular boxy kinda way...<br /><br />Maybe when my measurements change in a few months (back to school resolutions?), it'll look much better on me than it currently does."
4.0,The price for value is amazing. I would like to note that it's best to size down as the band of the sports bra is a little loose (on me personally). The white wasn't see through!
4.0,"I used this a lot, it's warm yet you can breath with it over your face. Color is pretty, would prefer to have a option with a string to tighten it up"
4.0,Very comfy and light weight so I don't get overheated when wearing it.
4.0,"They are cute and shiny... you could wear one to a Michael Jackson tribute concert :)  Seem warm, we'll see how warm as the weather cools off... we are just getting into fall with cool evenings here.<br /><br />I like them, but the claim in the description about being able to text with them on is a serious reach. Can get the screen to react if you hit it multiple times, but nowhere as good as your bare fingers or a stylis.  Mainly deducted a star for that... If I could have gone done only half star I would have."
4.0,Had been searching everywhere for white gloves small enough for a 2 year old. These were perfect! The material is not very thick but they seem to be made well and should hold up for a while.
4.0,Was lost in the mail to France. Not Taylor & Vine problem just USPS International Mail.
4.0,They are pretty small like everyone said but they are perfect and easy to put on.
4.0,Bought these for a backup pair because they're cute and inexpensive. I really like them and I love the way they look. Only complaint is they don't totally block the sun out and that's a huge issue for me. They would be perfect if the shading on the lenses covered the whole lens.
4.0,I got these in November and waited to review them until the weather got warmer. They are good winter bibs but the only problem I had with them is on the right pocket area the seam is coming loose. It survived a Fedex Express winter so I call it a win.
4.0,"I'm not upset with this outfit,  it isn't the best thing ever but it isn't terrible. Definitely has a very stiff feeling all over which in turn makes it feel very cheap but I guess for the price point it is sold at you can't expect much. It fit cute and worked for what I needed so thats all that matters. My daughter is 4 & weighs 35lbs for reference"
4.0,Much cheaper than buying a whole new umbrella
4.0,"This is a very cute necklace, sure to attract comment.  The reds are a brilliant coca-cola red, and the white stones are set into a  pink background, which isn't obvious by the photos.  The earrings, which are studs, are also white on pink. I would have preferred red stones, or at least a red background to match the necklace better.  The neckpiece is very well-made, and articulated nicely to lay perfectly along the collarbone.  The clasp is a very nice lobster claw, so extending it will be easy.  I will need to extend mine.  It seems like it's about 17&#34; long, and I need a minimum of 20&#34;.  In my opinion, this would be a very fun necklace to wear around kids, but it's not too over the top for most workplaces.  It's not the best choice for dressier occasions, but if you're the type who has her own sense of style, go for it!  I think this is perfect for weekend wear with jeans and sweaters, or lunch with the girls.  The shades of red make this a good choice for Valentine's Day or the holiday season.  It's very fun, and I know I'll wear mine often.  The earrings don't match terribly well, which is why it only gets 4 stars."
4.0,"its fuzzy, not like previous fleece jackets I've owned, so its hard to compare them. i got this when the cold weather is pretty much gone, so i havent gotten a chance to use it."
4.0,"Took this on vacation recently. My only complaint about this bag is that the bottom isn't flat, so it constantly falls over. I had a hard time propping it up on smaller pedestal sinks. Even though only one item was actual liquid, I wanted a clear make up bag in case TSA did a check. This bag fits quite a bit: tweezer/scissor, mini eyebrow comb, 3 full size eye shadow brushes, 3 full size brushes, full size blush, full size bronzer, 1 eye shadow duo, 1 eye shadow trio, 1 travel size mascara, 2 eyeliners, 1 round makeup sponge, full size 3 oz tinted moisturizer, lip balm, travel size setting spray. The little separated section is nice for items that are messy like the sponge so it doesn't get everything dirty. Seems durable."
4.0,"I love these earrings, they hang  a bit longer than I like but are very pretty. I would recommend them"
4.0,"Love the look and feel of this. Although i would have preferred a size up so that the belt could probably fit, but other than that it worked well. Will love to order another color"
4.0,"Purchased for my teenager, texture could have been better, kind of coarse. But excellent quality screenprint and color."
4.0,I wasn’t sure if it would fit me because lately I have been wearing both 2 and 3x clothes depending on the brand but these ran slightly larger and the 2x fit me just nicely. I really enjoy that the pockets are real. The only thing I don’t like so much is that they are shiny like yoga pant material but that’s not a huge issue. They will still be worn
4.0,"cute but if you have long legs, too short. I still like them though."
4.0,My daughter has a bit of a backside and I find it hard to find leotards that won't ride up.  This one fits great and I am thankful for the extra lining in the front.
4.0,Beautiful dress.  Wish I had gotten a size up
4.0,"I like this dress, don’t quite love it yet. Getting it tailored. I need that custom fit. Love the color! Fabric is nice. Will look better once it’s altered and ironed. The belt is a pain! It slides all over and won’t stay straight or in place. May have to pin it."
4.0,I like the bag. It's just a little bit bigger than what I wanted.
4.0,"I'm 5'5&#34; and 112 lbs. This fits well, it's not too short. Has a fun open back. Sort-of causes cameltoe though, so look out for that!"
4.0,they seem to be of good quality; haven't put them to the test yet
4.0,Very good quality and different.
4.0,Very nice quality -  bracelet looks very nice with others I have.
4.0,I would loved it if pants wont fade afer each laundry😣
4.0,"Very pretty floral print ""robe"". I hesitate to use the word kimono because except for the billowing sleeves, there's nothing kimono like about it. It's open. I do wish it came with some kind of belt for if you would like to tie it closed, but you can use some wide ribbon just as well. I like to wear this in the morning, when it's just a little chilly but not too bad. The sleeves will give you some grief when you're doing chores though so I'd regulate this to lounging. It's pretty, flowy, somewhat modest, but impractical."
4.0,"Doing Rocky Horror and drag, I wear a lot of heels, and was surprised by how comfortable and walkable these are for the price point. The laces have a bit of a habit of falling out of the loops so may need some reworking compared to how they're set up out of the box, but they look great."
4.0,"I love it and it’s going to go with my costume great! I am on the tightest option though, and it’s not as tight as I thought I was. Overall good buy though!"
4.0,"These were good quality and fit me. But my thighs are on the normal to smaller side. I got the large, and they barely fit (but it worked). Heavier thighs might not work. I found them comfortable enough to wear all day around the house. I don't think I could trust these to stay on going outside or doing a ton of walking."
4.0,I have used this key chain for months now. I take my keys off regularly for my job. This key ring has held up just fine. The only thing that would make it better is for it to be a little bigger.
4.0,"This was not exactly the same color that I ordered  so it loses 1 star.  This color wasn’t even an option when I placed the order.  There was no information provided re: a substitution.  However,  It looks fine (with a black watch cover for the 46mm) and feels quite nice."
4.0,I like it but it didn't come with a tempered glass screen protector like it said
4.0,"Good quality, nice fit, thick layered fabric"
4.0,Great belt but a bit larger than I anticipated. It fits but it almost to large. I am usually a medium in everything and I am on the very edge of the Velcro.
4.0,"Overview:<br />As described.<br />Experience:<br />Probably good attire for that next hurricane, or as an over wrap heading out to sea. It is water proof, light weight and fits well. You will stay dry. The material is light weight so it won't keep you warm, still need to layer up for any real weather. But being light weight it can be tucked away in the car or suitcase easily enough. Overall a good rain suit."
4.0,I realized I had more business cards than what it holds but I did get them organized and throw away duplicates and old ones. I like the card case.
4.0,"Loose fit is due to the fact that these are shorts with a mesh insert (think Men's bathing suits).  With that said, they are comfortable and do have padding but it doesn't always seat properly so you may find yourself adjusting while riding."
4.0,"This was a gift for my wife.  She said the bag is great.  The material is beautiful and sturdy.  It’s very roomy, not bulky.  She only wishes the straps would tighten a little bit more."
4.0,This watch band is absolutely awesome. Colors are bright. I bought it to wear with my tie-dye shirts but I love it so much I still have yet to change it out with anything else.
4.0,I liked this charm
4.0,"Bonnet doesn't stay on, slides down face"
4.0,It's cool and everything but I wish that it was a bit more thicker. If that was the case then this would be for sure a 5 star.
4.0,"It’s cute, definitely runs small."
4.0,Tie Clips were shipped in a timely matter and were as advertised.  Thank You!
4.0,Cute! Bottoms are a little smaller than expected. Very fast delivery.
4.0,nice quality shirt - it does have gold bottons which I didn't expect but nice
4.0,"At first, I had a hard time peeling off the backing to get this in my hats. Once I did, and my hats fit, it was worth it!! I would definitely buy again."
4.0,"Very cute. I wrote it to a work event and<br />received many compliments. I loved that it had pockets.  I bought a medium but it was a little too large.  I think I could have went with a small. Also, the skirt does have a ""shower curtain"" type material. I didn't mind too much because it felt light. However, it wrinkles rather easy."
4.0,Transitioning into the ankle length skirts. I saw these and loved them and the price was great. I got my skirts today .. they are really nice. One caution buy one size down. I am a medium and  my skirts are really big. I will have them cut down. ALL IN ALL THEY ARE REALLY NICE SKIRTS.
4.0,Never give a perfect rating. Pretty close to perfect tho. Really love them and the price
4.0,FOOT WAS A LITTLE BIG AND LEG WAS LONG BUT WORKED FOR THE FLIGHT TO IRELAND.
4.0,Nice keychain. Arrived as expected. The chrome contrasts wonderfully with the black leather. I'm hopeful that after months/years of use will make the black leather supple and pliable.
4.0,i like the dress. The quality wasn't as good as I had expected. But it IS cute
4.0,You'll want a slip.
4.0,"Super soft and comfy, but wore these to the gym and running on the treadmill resulted in me having to constantly pull these up with every few strides Waist band is definitely more for comfort, which sadly takes away the elasticity you need for these to be 5 star workout gear. No complaints though on being errand running yoga pants however. I'll still wear them, just not to the gym! Also *POCKETS* 🤌"
4.0,"the size was very good, it brings all the necessary pieces for a good costume, it is resistant, soft and warm"
4.0,Product as expected ... received on time
4.0,Super comfy all day and all night to sleep in. Only thing is they occasionally fall out when I’m sleeping.
4.0,Bought a little oversized for that particular fit. Shirt is beautiful and the material isn’t cheap. Very nice shirt.
4.0,very cute it fit perfectly
4.0,not as warm as it looks
4.0,"Its definitely not a form fitting shirt, but it was used for a pirate costume for the mermaid day parade and hit on all the levels needed. It was a thicker material which was surprising. Would recommend."
4.0,Nice shirt.  Was well priced. Now overpriced for a red Hanes T shirt.  Really looks vintage due to cracks in lettering.
4.0,"Love this Lucky shirt design. 3/4 sleeves. XL is long enough to cover the crotch area for an average 5' 5 woman.<br />The light bone color in the design is slightly raised with a fuzzy print with a little sparkle in it,  not just a flat print.<br />This sparkle in the fuzz comes off a little in the wash and looks like glitter all over the shirt. Some got on my husbands shirts, and he didn't like that. I think it will eventually wash away. I will update the review if it does.<br />Wash it in cold inside out, especially before wearing. I hang to dry because I want it to last forever.<br />Looks great with your best jeans. I choose pink earrings and bracelet to bring out the hot pink color in the flowers."
4.0,"Nice product. If you're going to use it in your aquarium, be sure to boil it for 20 to 60 minutes, then soak in a bucket of water for 2 weeks so the tannin doesn't make your water too murky. I learned the hard way, but also learned that most drift wood will still seep tannin for a very long time, but not as much when boiled and soaked properly. Remember, because it is a natural product, each one is unique."
4.0,"It was somewhat large, and I thought that the buckles on the side were adjustable, but they are not.  It is still a good quality material and nice cut.  I just made the mistake of washing it before I tried it on."
4.0,I love the shirt !
4.0,"These puma shoes are so nice. I love how the tongue of the shoe doesn’t move around. The inside of the shoes is very sponge like and soft like, helps with feet pain. The only complaint I have is they run a little snug instead of wide. Overall, I’m very happy with my purchase. Thank you for a good quality shoe."
4.0,"This dress is made of really good material. I bought a large just out of fear of sizing. The dress looked amazing. However it’s really short. Like a mini skirt. Try imagining a summer dress minus two more inches. I can’t even barely bend over without every being shown out the back. The dress fits really well other than that, so I gave it a 4."
4.0,"This order included 2 Camo watch bands for my Apple Watch Series 5 with a 44 mm face. Watch bands are lightweight but seem sturdy enough. One Camo band is a field Camo (green, brown, black yellow pattern) and one is a maritime Camo (Blue, Gray, Black). Time will tell how well the nylon bands hold up. The order was delivered faster than estimated at the time of ordering."
4.0,"Pretty bracelet and reasonably priced. The charms could be a little more delicate and clear, but that would probably raise the price ..... you get what you pay for. Gave it as a stocking stuffer and my daughter loved it."
4.0,Love the material of this robe and the length is perfect....the only reason for the 4 stars is that by what is pictured I was expecting a much darker color of purple.
4.0,"Love the t-shirt. It is very soft. I am a bit concerned about the decal as it looks like it could lift easily. I've washed it inside out only in cold, partially dry in dryer then hang dry for the rest. So far, it's still looks great."
4.0,"I absolutely love the color of this cover up !!!! The only issue I have is that it seems a little short . It's nice material, wrinkles easily but , that's not a big deal for me . Light weight, and the colts together are so pretty . I haven't washed it yet , probably will hand wash , as it seems a bit delicate. Would be five stars if it were 2-3 inches longer ."
4.0,"Very cheap material, but beautiful robe. The inner tie broke off within a week (and no washes), but you get what you pay for. Still really love the mauve color and design and think it's worth it for the around-the-house coverall I've been looking for."
4.0,"It was really nice and comfortable and it came on the right day, but it smelt like paint when I got it"
4.0,"The only thing I don’t like about it is the fabric divider that is flimsy, and just gets in the way so I surgically removed it to create one open bag. Much better. Otherwise I would give 5 stars."
4.0,Beautiful purse.  Small and not able to handle my MK wallet.
4.0,"Love the design: convenient to wear around neck and the adjustable ear loops are great. These are great for my kids for school, I don't have to worry as much about them losing their masks since they can keep them around their necks. The masks are double layered but breathable. The adjustable ear loops are great too, Easily adjust to fit me or the kids, and to loosen for comfort.<br />Only complaint is they have shrunk a bit in the wash so they dont fit my husband but they fit me and kids fine."
4.0,Fit great. But my kid keeps having to take them off because his feet get too warm. I think in deep winter they will be fine but right now they make his feet hot.<br />We used his shoe size and the fit is perfect.<br />Can run and jump easily without slipping on our wood floors!
4.0,Really nice. Sizing right on point. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that it is a little thin but can’t expect much thicker for the price.
4.0,I love how thick and cozy this product is! I wish the sleeves were longer though. They are a little too short. I usually wear a Medium. I ordered a Large. I will defiantly be shipping it back for an XL. Order 2 sizes up!
4.0,"Fit good, looked really cute on, didn’t really like how stuff the bottom was feels like a costume more than a regular shirt (but I bought it for Halloween so it worked out ok)"
4.0,"I haven't worn them to work out yet, but they fit perfectly. They have a key pocket which is great."
4.0,"These lightweight hooded cardis are well made, of a very light, stretchy, and smooth material with good stretch recovery (for example, if you push your sleeves up they will recover their shape instantly).  They look nice.  You will be able to wear these any season because they are so very lightweight.  Figure flattering, not baggy or lumpy."
4.0,I read a lot of the comments and saying go a size up. They weren't lying. I did a XL normally I'm a meduim but the skirt fits little tight. And the button is a little lose too. Overall super cute and love the skirt.
4.0,"My husband loves the caps that make it look like he still has a healthy head of hair, and he is a big Guy Fieri fan so he loves the look.  Thanks for keeping it going."
4.0,This is a surprisingly nice item for the price.  I would reccomend if interested in something nice but for everyday or work.
4.0,"The thin metal decorative pieces keep getting stuck in my hair and pulling it out, other than that I love them"
4.0,"Perfect lightweight sweater. When you pull the sleeves up, they are stretched out when put back down. All in all, just what I was looking for. Fits perfect."
4.0,This is a very comfortable wrap. The material is soft and it is easy to sleep in
4.0,Solid construction but occasionally snags my hair
4.0,Thin and stretchy. Great as under shirt
4.0,"I'm usually between an M and an L, but I went with M on these. I'm glad I did."
4.0,"This watch came exactly as advertised.  It has a great color and very stylish appearance, the only drawback for me was that it was a smidge smaller then my previous Casio. Other then that it is a great watch. Very subtle bling."
4.0,I bought this for my girlfriend who liked it in the store
4.0,"I had purchase a Browning belt a few years ago.  It was a much better belt, but this one is very good.  I was expecting the same belt, but it's been a few years and thinks change.  It's still a good belt."
4.0,"Arrived on time, shoe is for my mother. Love the strapping system! Hope she likes them just that it was missing the extra insole inserts as indicated on paper. Overall I think that I will continue to purchase shoes like this if my mother likes the comfort. Seems very durable, quality workmanship."
4.0,I wish the cloth is thicker. It’s a bit thin for my taste .
4.0,"The selling point of this dress for me was that it says in the description that it is 100% Rayon. This dress is 90% polyester and I forget what the rest of the percentage says but it is definitely 100% lies!!!!!! Booooo!! All of my thumbs down!! Also, half the buttons were buttoned and the dress was all balled up as if it had been tried on....but that's no big deal, I always wash new clothes right away.<br /><br />Other than those lame things mentioned...it fits better than expected, it looks super cute ((I got the black and white zebra one in L, I am 150lb, 5'3"")) Looks perfect with a wide belt (I tried mine on with a hot pink belt and hot pink Doc Martens and I really can't wait to wear this out when the weather cools down a little more)"
4.0,Thought it would be thicker material
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:e4a83667f9fd4ef66a5674bdf75a6151]] I like these earmuffs, they're not too thick but they weren't expensive either, I live up north and the lowest temperature so far that we had was like three degrees, and these kept my ears warm. My ears are the first ones usually to get cold; very cold. I'm happy with my purchase."
4.0,"I am a size 2/4, ordered a small, im 5’. Its a just little loose but perfectly fine. Perfect summer sun dress."
4.0,Some careful ironing and a petticoat and...tadaaa! Cute as heck!
4.0,"I really like this shirt, it can be casual or dressed up."
4.0,Love the print.  A little boxy but good with leggings.  Doesn't shrink in the dryer and comes out great.
4.0,"Print it a bit light, but it's still cute."
4.0,My daughter loves it.  Very good quality for what it is.  Better than I expected for the price.
4.0,Was super impressed by the quality but had to return as it fit about two sizes too small
4.0,"I tried this for the first time the other day on a hike I went on. It didn't feel really any different (other than it felt like I was wearing a girdle). However, after I finished, I took it off and noticed around where it had been on my mid-section, I was quite literally soaking with sweat (sorry, didn't mean to gross you out). Now, whether or not that will help lose weight in that general vicinity is still up for debate. It happens to be a little early to make a conclusion one way or another. But as far as making me sweat way more than I did elsewhere, it did--by quite a bit."
4.0,"Ordered 2XL (generally 16). Fit well. Felt nice. Looked good. BUT, had to return due to the extreme long length of the arms. (Maybe if I was a gorilla, it would have been perfect!) Too bad."
4.0,This is an elegant bracelet but beware..........it will come open and fall off without notice.
4.0,wasn't exactly the color I ordered. But still cute nonetheless.  would order again. Fast shipping
4.0,"You have to order one for your daughter then order one for yourself. It does not come as a set, FYI. My daughter's came first, and it fits her well! Mine fit well at first, but after washing it, it is now a little short. I ordered the sleeveless dresses. The dresses are comfortable, not the most flattering cut for a post second child mom body, but it is still pretty cute. I just have to wear shorts under my dress now. I probably ordered a large, I am 5'3&#34; and 142 lbs."
4.0,"The waistband rolls - which could be a personal fit issue, but other cycling shorts don't. Overall, great fit and comfort"
4.0,"Bought for my son's hs graduation, but he didn't wear it..."
4.0,It looks great on him!
4.0,"My fiance loves his Darth Vader wallet! We took away one star because it took almost two and a half weeks to be delivered, but other than that, it is lightweight, has great organization pockets, and seems pretty durable so far."
4.0,"The dress itself fit well but the waist was in a strange spot, higher than my waist. Made the dress feel boxy on me. I felt that my shoulders were too broad and even though the lace was stretchy, I worried about ripping it. I'm 5'9"" and 155 lbs. The medium was plenty long. Pretty well made dress just not for me."
4.0,The hat fits my daughter perfectly!
4.0,It will do.  My one complaint is the opening at the neck is not large enough to comfortably get into the jumpsuit without tearing some part of the suit.  I sewed the neck piece back together as I did not want the hassle of sending it back.
4.0,It was a little small for a large but nice otherwise.
4.0,"A bit more faded than in the photos, and quality doesn't seem that high, but good size and looks nice all in all."
4.0,"Shirt runs a little big but I love this shirt! It's very light fabric, it's a little see through. Easy to pair with anything."
4.0,This shirt is loose and super comfy. The keyhole back is a really cute detail.
4.0,"I like the fit and feel, but I’m 4’11”. I thought it would cover my knees at my height but it didn’t."
4.0,"Fashionable, nicely tailored, wish it had front pocket. Very good for price I got all three colors."
4.0,It fit great but the shape was a little off.  Still worth it for the cost.
4.0,Wish it had a pocket but I love Southern Fried Cotton products!
4.0,I really like these pants but they did shrink a little in the wash and are high-waters now.
4.0,Cute too/dress long put mine with leggings
4.0,Ordered a xl. Said it fit like a size 8 medium. Um no. It fit like a huge XL shirt. Return for smaller size
4.0,"The band is a little cheap, but you get what you pay for. Overall I'm satisfied with it"
4.0,Very very thin but pretty.
4.0,"Comfortable, compression is a little weaker than past products from same company"
4.0,Performed as advertised. Took on a 2 week trip to Europe. Had sufficient pockets for storage.
4.0,"Cute shirt! I needed a shirt fast to display my house pride and this was reasonably priced and got to me quickly. The logo is good quality and I think it will stand up to washing well.<br />I will say that it runs small. I am pretty busty but usually fit fine into XLs, but this was incredibly tight. Not tight enough to return, obviously, but tight enough it won't be the first shirt I reach for on future Harry Potter days."
4.0,These shorts are very comfortable and very cute. My only wish is that the material was a little more compression like.  But overall these are super wonderful and super comfortable
4.0,another great product from eagle eye.
4.0,"For the price, adequate. Shirt was a little thin. Did the job for a 5 hour event. Delivery as expected."
4.0,"Elegant.  A pearl came off but fixable. Using a long-nosed pliers, I connected it by tightening jump ring.  All other rings were fine."
4.0,"There’s not too much to complain about here. It seems to be durable in its construction. The different patterns/colors are nice. Connects well to the watch. My only complaint is that it’s not really a solo loop as it has the adjustable slider which I find feels bulky and sometimes moves when I try to stretch the loop onto my wrist. Would be better for them to commit to offering different sizes and remove the adjustable aspect. But overall, good for the price."
4.0,makes a uniboob but holds them in comfortably
4.0,"Very pretty, good fit, only issue is the tassels keep coming out."
4.0,These for my 7 year old well. But the ankle strap doesn’t strap tight enough. The color was perfect abs quality looks good. The heel is cute and not too high for a kid who wants to run around and play.
4.0,These are very nice. I bought them for my 6 ft son. They’re a lil snug and a lul short. Definitely size up.
4.0,"I purchased a large, am 5'6&#34; 160# and it is very flattering for my figure. I love it."
4.0,Great dress ! It is flowy and didn't go past my knees. True to color. Looks great with tights !
4.0,Fit well but I sew in the pads so they do not move all over the place.
4.0,"All my other were X LG, this one is the same as they, so all is right in the world...my pants fit."
4.0,size runs small. Fabric is thin.
4.0,"My husband wears a 13 wide shoe. He likes to wear socks even with his slippers and these fit him. I ordered the size 13. The toes are a little tight but I will just use my shoe stretchers on those. Otherwise, he is happy :)"
4.0,"Very sylish. I thought this was a wristlet, but only 2 fingures could fit in the loop. Still cute."
4.0,I loved this dress! It was a great investment and it has good fabric and it’s great quality!
4.0,"HaDlin Mens Multi Pockets Cargo Shorts Relax Fit Camo Cotton Military Pants came nicely packed without any damage.This cargo shorts is made of 100% Cotton material and stitching is done well. It has got 2 slanted pocket on front, 2 back flap pockets and 4 cargo flap (one pocket is on top of the other).It has got drawstring legs which allow us to make necessary adjustments on the bottom of the shorts and got loops for belt."
4.0,"Very pretty & light mask. Purchased for my daughter to wear to prom. Had to return it because the crystals give off a goldish gleam/sparkle, not silver, which clashed with the jewels on her dress. Otherwise, I would've kept the mask because it really is an elegant type of pretty that can be worn anywhere, not over-the-top, loud & gawdy. And it was very lightweight. It weighed next to nothing which was surprising because of the jewel accents. They tend to make things heavier. Also, the inside fabric that's against your face is not silk like their other masks. I bought their black 90210 silk mask instead and it's perfect!"
4.0,I love this belt it fits me perfect and I love the color the only negative thing is that it has a strong chemical smell I haven't been able to wear it I have it hanging until the odor dissapears
4.0,Very nice shorts fit good
4.0,"Love this, but after everyday use the color starts to scratch off."
4.0,Just what I needed it's not a think material i could still wear it in the fall without feeling too bundled up. Only down fall was since I ordered both colors white and burgundy bundle they actually came together in one package. Which messed up the white one ... an In the picture i posted you can see a light red smudged from the burgundy bleeding on it. I tried washing it so i would not have to go through the return so I tried to compromise and fix it myself  didnt work Haha and it stayed on the white still.. good thing it's onthe back only but I'll just wear a cardigan over it and Rember not to take my sweater off lol.  So don't order the bundle with burgandy and white together order it separately.
4.0,Perfect for a daily gym visits except one thing. The shoe compartment could be an inch or so wider. I wear an 11M and it’s a tight squeeze but over all pleased with this choice.
4.0,"Not super smelly. Very warm and not super breathable. Vision not the best. If you are wearing for short period or dress up it is great. If you are going to be walking around or wearing for longer than 15 minutes, you may want to reconsider"
4.0,Great fit for my yoga classes. Two thumbs up
4.0,Love the purse. Just wish the interior was purple like the picture instead of pink
4.0,"the package said white, they are grey"
4.0,Perfect for my halloween costume however they were super long and super tight around the top. I expected them to be somewhat long since i'm on 5'2&#34; however they went almost to my mid thigh.
4.0,Cute wrinkles eazy
4.0,If this vest had a two way zipper it would be 5 stars plus
4.0,"Love the outfit it was too short across the chest area, I did reorder a larger size"
4.0,I LOVE the GG! This onesie is beautiful! I just wish there was a little give on the material to help put it on
4.0,"I bought this bracelet as a Christmas gift, so I don't yet know if my niece will appreciate it. But, I like it very much. So much so  that if she doesn't want it, I would keep and wear it myself!"
4.0,"I ordered this dress for a wedding, I like it and was planning on wearing it but only had to return because the bride changed the dress color at the last minute.  Cute dress and looked very nice, especially for the price!"
4.0,Really cute outfit and the price is greAt
4.0,"I was very happy with this wallet. I am a huge fan of the clutch wallets, but have found that a lot of them don't have the space that I need to put all my cards. This is not the case with this purchase. The wallet has a lot of room, and as an added bonus in the zippered portion, it has another zippered compartment for change. This is awesome for me because all the other zippered portions in past wallets have has small gas where my change fell out, so this adds extra security. The colors are true to the picture, and it seems very sturdy, however the button that closes the main portion of the wallet is difficult to open. The only reason this worries me is because I don't want to pull too hard and rip out the clasp. I have loved it so far and would recommend it!"
4.0,nice but on me top is a little large
4.0,Bought them for my daughter.She loved them.
4.0,They’re really nice and cute but sadly some of them half broken!
4.0,"I was super excited to get this bathing suit for this upcoming summer!  The design (black and white polka-dot) is adorable, and the flowiness of the top covers up any imperfect areas I don't want to emphasize.  The top doesn't provide a ton of support, but the overall design and price is enough for me to give it a whirl!<br /><br />I am very busty (36G), and so I am used to having to deal with cleavage when it's not necessarily &#34;supposed&#34; to be there.  This bathing suit is no exception.  I am impressed that the top holds my chest as well as it does, I just wish the polka-dotted top piece was a bit longer, to accommodate a fuller bust.<br /><br />The bottoms fit perfectly, and they are super-cute with the side ties.<br /><br />Overall, for the price and cute design, I am really happy with this suit!"
4.0,Good fit and wicking.
4.0,These feel ok. But they make a flip flop noise when walking. My other Birkenstock shoes do not. This is definitely a noisy shoe. Be warned. People will hear you coming and going.
4.0,"The beanie is dark charcoal grey not black. It looks just like the picture which is shows it as charcoal grey so it's exactly what I expected. It is very long, has great slouch. It is pretty soft and lightweight despite the thickness. It also looks like it should be a child's hat. It's like 3/4 of the width of my other beanies so when I put it on I expected to be disappointed BUT this beanie is SUPER stretchy. When I put it on I could not tell it was originally so small. It looked normal. I have a medium sized head. My boyfriend has a huge head and it looked like a bottle nipple on him.<br /><br />TL:DR version: Soft, very long with a lot of slouch, lightweight knit, looks small but very stretchy.<br /><br />I DID NOT receive this product at a discount or for free in exchange for my review. I actually bought it full price. Shocker."
4.0,"The little boy hangs over the charm a little bit a tends to get caught and pop off....I have lost him twice,,,,but eventually found again"
4.0,"I like this sports bra and I get compliments on it all the time, but ITS SO SMALL. Thank goodness I followed the reviews and got a size up (normally I’m a L and I got XL) or I wouldn’t be able to get it on at all. I still have a hard time getting it off sometimes after working out, but it keeps my girls in place!"
4.0,"I really like this shirt.  It fits well, I am 5'3'' and usually wear a medium top, and I was looking for something that fit snug to my legs but loose everywhere else, and I found it!  The black is really black, not faded in any way, and the shipping was super fast for choosing the free option, I received it faster than anticipated.  I like the comfy look, I can choose to wear it over both shoulders, or just the one for the of the shoulder look, I haven't tried rolling up the cuffs of the sleeves just yet but I will be giving it a try, just have yet another look with this shirt."
4.0,Not as big as I thought it would be but definitely good and easy to organize!
4.0,"Pretty sturdy cap. Elastic drawstraw string has good recoil. One thing I’ve noticed about these caps is after being washed, over time they tend to shrink a little"
4.0,"Cheaply made, but it is perfect for throwing in a suitcase and taking on a trip.  I always seem to bring back more than I take and this helps with that problem."
4.0,Got it for a back up dress
4.0,These were cute but they didn't fit so we returned them and I don't know how they would hold up.
4.0,NICE COLOR GOOD QUALITY
4.0,Fits good.  Feels great.
4.0,Smaller than what I expected. But overall got the job done
4.0,(Reviewed by my wife): This is a very bold and interesting looking watch with lots of bling.  It has a rose gold colored band and a rose gold colored watch with roman numerals.  The face is fairly large and is surrounded by sparkly faux diamonds.  The watch band is roomy and adjustable.  The watch comes wrapped around a pillow in a gift box.  It is definitely giftable.
4.0,Very nice and adjustable.
4.0,"Things are not quite as clear at night as I hoped, but they do help the glare."
4.0,"Great PJ’s, soft on the skin and toasty warm. Problem is seams split developing holes."
4.0,Pretty dress. A little smaller than I thought and I went up a size. I can still wear it just tight around my bust. But I am D and I bought the XL to accommodate.
4.0,"This dress is really comfortable and super cute too but it runs big. I’m normally a large and I ordered a medium and I probably could’ve gotten away with a small. It’s a little thick, like there’s a lot of fabric, but it’s really comfortable, and the bell sleeves are cute too. I’ll be returning it but may end up ordering it in a small because I really do like it!"
4.0,I like the softness and the pattern. I don't know if I ordered the wrong size or was sent the wrong size by mistake.
4.0,"I thought it would be a little longer. It fits down to about mid-thigh. But I only bought it to wear with jeans so I don't mind. If you're going to be wearing a skirt and really don't want your pants to get wet below mid-thigh, be sure to get the full length raincoat. This one will fit over your cloth jacket and is very lightweight. It fits into the small bag it comes with. The bag is made of the same material as the jacket so it takes up very, very little space in your carry-on luggage and weighs practically nothing. Great for traveling."
4.0,"these pants came in about fifteen days earlier than expected which was definitely a plus, however they are slightly baggier than I'd like them to be. to be fair, I am decently short and small and they fit well in the waist and length which is very rare for me. they're stretchy which I like, they're much more flexible that regular denim jeans. a good product that I'd recommend to others"
4.0,Good for the price. It's worth it.
4.0,"They were great the only thing is that 2 socks came with small holes near the toes. But! they're what I expected and at the time I was looking for tall socks. Also if you have thick legs as they go up they will be a little tight,  WILL BE ORDERING MORE. Thank You"
4.0,I was so worried about it fitting ! To surprise it fit perfect !
4.0,looked great and fit great.
4.0,Wish it was just a bit looser for it being an XL. Bit the color is great and I love the embellishments on the hem.
4.0,Purchased this for my granddaughter.  It fits her perfect and looks very cute on her<br />I would recommend this for anyone
4.0,"I like these, though the top is a bit tight. They stay on my feet and keep my toes warm in the cold of winter.<br />I also like them during warm weather as a simple sock to absorb sweat.<br />They are great for around the house.<br />My daughter steals them."
4.0,"The teal shadowing is a little more blue then teal. Still cute! And it fit better than i expected. Im a big girl with huuuge boobs and i dont normally wear jr. Sizes. Its a little short,  but i plan on wearing it tucked into a short white skirt, so its good ;P"
4.0,I like it! Works great for our worship dance at Church. I wish the material was somewhat better but for the price is good. The colors are awesome!
4.0,This dress fit perfectly! The material is a better quality than other muxxn dresses. The only reason why I didn't give it 5 stars is that the arm holes are somewhat large for the dress size.
4.0,Very comfortable and good fitting
4.0,Love this shirt! Was exactly what I wanted!
4.0,Very cute. Love the cloth and pretty colors.
4.0,"I love this dress, just wish it had a little more room in the chest. I’ve worn it it twice. It can be dressed up with a necklace, earrings and a pair stylish shoes."
4.0,Our granddaughter loves these shoes.  They do wear out quicker than I expected.
4.0,"Practical, convenient. Seems well made."
4.0,"Why I like this skirt set:<br />- VERY comfortable material, and accommodating to various shaped women - especially those with a very large waist/belly.<br />- Should be able to wear them even in warmer weather here in the NW.<br />- Four nicely colored skirts for a reasonable price!<br />Why I'm a bit less thrilled:<br />- WAY too long - I'm 5'4&#34; and could easily wear these as bandeau-top dresses!<br />But stretchy material is too hard to sew - so I'll fold over the waist &#34;bands&#34; (flattened over my stomach) to shorten. Hope fully this will work.<br />- Can't machine wash {:-{"
4.0,"This ring is absolutely gorgeous.  It is a little large but that makes it all the more beautiful.  But the size is a bit large.  But I still love it.  I cannot speak of the long term durability of this ring but I have worn this while washing my hands, but I do not wear it daily.  It is still sparkly and shiny."
4.0,"I LOVE my new coat. It's so soft and warm! I would give it four stars but for the fit. I am 5'7&#34; and usually wear a small jacket, but I ordered a large in this coat due to reviews I had read. Definitely order up one size, but order up two if you want a baggy fit with room for sweaters and other layers, as well as arms that reach your wrists."
4.0,"These are good slippers for the price, but don't have a long lifespan in my experience. After 6-months of use, they're a lot less cushioned (so the fit is less snug and cozy)."
4.0,"It's a little thin, but I love the color. It's soft."
4.0,"When I received the shirt, i was surprised that it is nicer than the product images.<br /><br />To start, I love the actual color. The blue is a more of an aqua than what is shown in the images. It is also a solid color - no pattern. The images look as if there are darker strands running through the shirt. The material is soft, stretchy and breathable. There were no problems with the quality. No loose threads, missing buttons or poor stitching.  Although it says regular fit, the shirt is cut more like a slim fit. I thought I had ordered the wrong size, but after looking more closely, the shirt is slightly tapered on the sides and narrower in the sleeves. Since it still has a nice look without appearing tight, I’m okay with the cut, but if you like your shirt with more room in the torso, then be sure to order one size larger. This is especially true if you have bigger biceps.<br /><br />A nice shirt to wear with jeans or under a blazer. Thumbs up!"
4.0,The color was a tad off from what I had expected but overall the dress was very high quality and very beautiful!!!
4.0,"Loved the look and quality was worth the price, very comfortable"
4.0,"I sweat a lot when I workout and needed some pants that looked good and were good at moisture wicking. These fit the bill. They are not so thin that they're see-through around the booty area but they are still cool and comfortable. No visible sweat-marks after an intense workout! Minus one star for being a bit too big for the sizing chart recommendations. I fall between and medium and a large due to smaller waist (29) and larger rear-end/hips (41). I always go with what will fit my hips so I went with large here, which fit, but if they stretch much or I lose a bit of butt, they will be too big. I'd re-order in a medium for sure though! Came back for that and they don't have them in stock. :(<br /><br />One thing I noticed - I use these for rock climbing and then running on the treadmill after. On the wall, they felt a little &#34;snaggy&#34; if they brushed against the rougher holds. Something about the nylon material vs. cotton I think. Not enough to be a pain, but might bother some people. I still give them high marks!"
4.0,"The sweater is a good quality, and lettering is placed evenly and straight. Thickness is more like a slightly thicker long sleeve shirt than a sweater. Runs big! Definitely order a size down if you are wanting your little to wear immediately or for a photo shoot. We ordered a 2T, and it’s more like a 3-4T. Still, better than the product running small. Overall, good purchase."
4.0,I can only go by what my 13 year old niece thought and she really liked it. I bought it as a gift for Christmas. She's a huge fan.
4.0,I Love this sexy dress 💯
4.0,"The 2 leotards are beautiful.  However, I cannot adequately comment on them since they were bought for my grand-daughter for Christmas.  I know she'll like them but I don't know about sizing yet."
4.0,A little tighten
4.0,"The quality of this shoe is obvious when you see them. They also have a great sole. The only reason we returned ours was my son has chunkier feet and ankles, and these seem like they would fit a slim foot better!  For our chunky baby feet we love pedipeds and robeez!"
4.0,"First pair arrived broken due to thin frames. Seller shipped replacements with excellent customer service. The glasses are inexpensively made, but function well and aren't anything different than you can get from a place like H&M for a few dollars more."
4.0,"BEWARE...The apricot color is a different style than the other colors. If you pay attention to the picture you will notice it. I gave it a try anyway and the sleeves are longer, the dress is shorter,  runs smaller and the material is thinner( see thru). I did not like it, so I returned. However, I love the fit of the other ones I purchased (black and l. grey). I'm 5'9, size 14 and the large fits great. The dress reaches my ankles, looks nice on my curves and the material is also good quality. Just wouldn't  recommend the apricot color."
4.0,I was pleased with the quality of this product and the fast delivery. Sizing was very accurate. My only complaint would be that I thought it would be a little thicker material like a towel. But overall I am pleased.
4.0,Runs a little big but other wise very nice
4.0,"Excellent shirts! Quality of women's shirt isn't as good as male's shirt, however. But all in all my guy and I loved the shirts. We got lots of compliments when we were them. Shipping was fast!"
4.0,"I love it, would have given 5 stars bit the split is not as high as picture. I'm 5' 5&#34; and the split came to my knees"
4.0,"I'm kinda weird about my earrings clinking around since they're so close to my ears. I haven't had a chance to wear these out of the house yet, but I've tried them on and they metal definitely clinks around as you move your head. That being said, they're beautifully made and look amazing on. There was even a sweet thank you card, hand-signed by the person that did the quality-check, which is just such a nice touch. These earrings are very giftable, if you don't mind the noise factor! (deducted one star for the noise, but otherwise I love them!)"
4.0,Run small. Lots of cool designs.
4.0,"pretty cool one of the better impulse buys, i bought a bunch of necklaces that were below 5 bucks and this one was actually good.<br /><br />definitely recommend<br />http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00AWMBX1Q/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_6<br />You should buy this mini clock. It was 3 bucks now its 5 but the quality is really good and it has a functional clock and is super cool."
4.0,"Fit really well except that it strains a bit on my chest, but it's not super noticeable. The only reason I'm giving 4 stars instead of 5 is the wrinkles. It's be fine if they ironed out easily enough, but even after going over them more then a few times, some of them just wouldn't come out T_T. Luckily it's also not SUPER noticeable, but enough to knock it down 1 star. Love the dress otherwise!"
4.0,This wallet is just the right size for when i go to workouts or traveling when you need some ID but not as much as usual.  The RFID blocking feature works well.  With my old wallet I could leave my door card inside and just touch it to the scanner and my door would open.  I tried to scan my key card through this new wallet and the scanner could not read it.  The only reason I did not give 5 stars is that the first wallet I received had a broken zipper and I had to order a new one which - at the time - was very inconvenient.  Kudos to Amazon's customer service for making that exchange as quick as possible!!
4.0,Was a gift...not a bad product.
4.0,Seam split on finger...  company was very quick in responding and correcting the issue!
4.0,"Mine is not the slightest bit purple....... turquoise/aqua/peach tones<br />I will keep it and use it with other items, BUT I WAS REALLY LOOKING FOR PURPLE!<br />Has a nice weight"
4.0,great only complaint is it is too small to be worn as a dress go a size or 2 up i usually ear a L and the xl was like a long shirt but not long enough to be worn alone. i am 5/3 and 190 pounds wear a size 12 pant and L shirts
4.0,This is the 2nd D.B. Moon tunic top I have bought amd they are a good quality top.
4.0,"Note the print is on one side, you can see a faded version of it on the other side but there's clearly a ""wrong side"". Very large size though and durable fabric. Can get creases."
4.0,"These were given as a gift to an older female relative.  She is old enough to remember when a ""lady"" wouldn't leave her house without hat & gloves.  She kept asking me about when she was supposed to wear the gloves (like what occasions) until I managed to explain that glove-wearing was on the rise for Covid protection, not etiquette.  Pink is her favorite color & she liked the gloves.  She won't use the touch-screen function, so I won't try to rate that."
4.0,"I have a large (larger) head so these work well for me. The lenses are pretty inexpensive so they don't provide great glare protection, they just make things darker."
4.0,"The bra is comfortable and doesn't feel (so far) like it will ride up, which is what I'm hoping for. I have a long torso and have never found a bra that truly works for me - they ALL ride up. The color is nice, it is very well-made and definitely worth the cost. My only issue is that it runs small. I ordered a large and was hoping to have a loose fit as shown in the photo, but the large barely fits a 36C. I can still wear it if I stretch it out beforehand so it's not a total loss. I'm ordering an XL now and will update on the fit after it arrives."
4.0,"I love my bag, it's just a little smaller than I expected but was perfect for a carry on for my cruise."
4.0,"Good material, it washes well. Only downside that I have is that it runs a little small, would be better to buy next size up."
4.0,Nice suit just too big!
4.0,I had to get it altered because the armholes and top portion are too large but it’s so cute I don’t mind. I’m used to having to get a larger size to fit my tush and alter the top. The materIal is nice and looks good on otherwise.
4.0,"These are great for extra pairs - I have them stashed in various places - purse, car, etc.  They don't seem super sturdy, but are great to take out to read a menu, or a label or such."
4.0,Looks really Besutiful & it's good quality. Size is perfect .
4.0,"Good helmet, runs small"
4.0,Love it! It twists and looks kinda weird when you hang it on stuff but functionally it’s great.
4.0,Larger fit than expected.  I’m 5’9 and 175lbs
4.0,"I like the material, colors and drawstring. However it runs smaller vs their mesh hoodie tanks"
4.0,It was what i ordered. Looks cool and nice bright colors.
4.0,"Love the way they look, unfortunately I will only wear them in the summer or the fall they get wet and dirty quite easily. I sill think it's worth it :)"
4.0,"Purchased for my husband and he likes them. They don't seem as cheap as they actually are, which is great. The earrings are still holding up good and for four pairs you can't beat the price!"
4.0,This was one of two gifts for my sweetheart for Father's Day and he actually he actually thought it was very happy to wear it
4.0,Such a find!! This dress is amazing.  I ordered a size up and think I could have ordered my regular size. The fabric is the softest satin - I touched it up with an iron before wearing and it ironed beautifully. I can't wait to wear it again. And again. I am curious to see how it holds up over time. Planning to order other patterns of the dress in a smaller size.
4.0,"I know I solve read the instructions, but after washing and drying it, it shrunk so much!! Other than that, I loved it when I wrote the first time!"
4.0,"Share a b-day with Van Gogh, so collecting jewelry of his works to wear."
4.0,"I probably would have rated this bag higher, had it arrived in the color I ordered.  I still like it, just a bit disappointed."
4.0,"Not very stylish, but the wrap partially around and do a good job of blocking the sunlight."
4.0,"I love this shirt.  It is so soft and comfortable and I love the way it fits.  My only complaint is that the color is slightly oranger than the red in the photo.  Other than that, it's great."
4.0,I copied the idea to use the vampire fangs as napkin rings for a spooktacular Halloween table setting. These are small to use as fangs but a fun decoration. They  had to be tied with twine to hold the napkin in place but otherwise it was a great look.
4.0,"A bit short for being 24&#34; other then that it seems to be well made, has decent weight to it, I will be giving it to my girlfriend, it will fit her better."
4.0,Good fit and warm. Washable.
4.0,"This runs small so size up. Even with sizing up, this is a very fitted dress, just FYI! But soft and comfortable. I get a lot of compliments."
4.0,"My wife ordered these. She says they're comfortable and all that, but I knocked a star off because they're non see through. Sure, the product clearly states ""non see through"", but I prefer the see through variety. Otherwise, they arrived in a timely fashion and all that."
4.0,Love it! I ordered a small the first time and it was too big so I sent it back for an XS. I also ordered a gold bubble shield for it which looks awesome! Helmet fits great and is comfortable.
4.0,"Sexy, see-though, except in the very front."
4.0,"I bought the smallest one and have it on the tightest closure and it's still too big, but I had a feeling it might be. I fit in size 14/16 girls clothes so it's not a huge surpise."
4.0,Fits perfect. Material is a bit thinner then the ones I've previously purchased.
4.0,"Bright colors, but they may fade with age. Wears comfortably, not heavy after all day wear, several complements."
4.0,"Is a little bit large, quality is good for that price, I like"
4.0,"very nice bag.  I am returning  it b/c it's too big for me, but it's super nice, has lots of pockets, and very professional looking.  It doesn't look cheap at all.  Kudos!"
4.0,This tank has an A line cut that takes away from look..Clearly the bottom is pinned in the back on the model..To get the look I have to alter the sides sewing a seam straight .. Fabric and look of the item is okay. 36C large fits great..
4.0,Beautiful stainless steel chain. I love the shine and the length is perfect. Thought it was going to be a little bit thicker but not bad for the price. Definitely worth it.
4.0,"Lanyard is almost rubber band like, wasn't exactly expecting it to be that stretchy."
4.0,Like the color feel of the shirt. Wish it was longer and got two for the price of one.
4.0,"Adorable pattern, my boyfriend loved them, but they apparently run small. I would suggest sizing up once."
4.0,Cute but gave it to my sister because it was too large and long
4.0,"I like this pendant a lot. It's about the size of a dime, but the star in the picture is not like the star on the pendant. The star on the pendant doesn't have the overlapping of the lines like the picture, but instead just a star with the pentagon in the middle. I didn't think that it was that small, but it's still nice and i like it. :) i didn't think that it would come with a cord(black), but it did and its very short. I ended up taking it off and using a chain from one of my older necklaces. I was also worried it might leave green lines like cheap jewelry does, but it does not do that. overall very pleasing, but not quite what i was expecting."
4.0,"All the other reviews are pretty spot on. Things to realize before you buy: 1. You need a low cut bra (or no bra if you get down like that). 2. The split makes sitting a tad difficult. I had to be mindful to keep my legs crossed at the knee or ankle. 3. THE SEQUINS WILL RUIN YOUR ARMS! Maybe not a big deal if you won't be in the room for a while. My inner biceps were irritated and scratched after a night out. Not the end of the world, but something I didn't consider about the dress."
4.0,Some say class of 2022. Some say congrats.
4.0,"This watch is just wonderful--keeps accurate time (have been monitoring the watch's accuracy and has gained only 1 second within the last 3 weeks of monitoring...VERY ACCURATE). In addition, the rotating bezel is solid and easy to turn. The dial is a good 44mm and is about 46mm(including the crown). In addition, the the luminous hour markers is really good (about 7 hours).  The luminous hands light up VERY bright but within about 15 minutes or so the brightness dissipates and the after glow sets-in (its not bright at this point but bright enough to see in a pitch black room which will last about 6.5 more hours or so).  The watch band is a little chinsy-feeling in my opinion but DEF NOT a deal-breaker (which is the ONLY reason I am giving it 4 out of 5 stars).<br /><br />All-in-all, the time-proven quality that Casio provides is definitely shows in the watch's accuracy and design.  If you are looking for an affordable (do NOT let the price fool you), good-looking and accurate quartz diver--this is the one i recommend!!"
4.0,My daughter loved it. Thanks
4.0,"and comfy! great for an hourglass shape. Comfy, pretty, and cool to wear in hot temps. I do see a bit of wear after one wash, though. But, for $20 it's  a good value"
4.0,"The metal tag with the phoenix is great and durable.  However, the chain is flimsy and broke after a several weeks of use, losing the phoenix.  :(  Going to reorder and swap the chain. out for something more durable."
4.0,"I always wear a size Medium in Wranglers, but this brand has that skinny rodeo cut so I had to get a size Large."
4.0,"Fits well on my nearly four year old with a big head. Doesn’t fit on my two and a half year old with a normal sized head. Good colors, breathable. Looks cute as a bandana."
4.0,"The inseam of the pant is too tight, not enough material.  All other areas are fine."
4.0,"Beautiful dress, we received many compliments. It did take a while to arrive and some of the red beads around the waist were loose but that was an easy fix."
4.0,Beautiful stopper bead. The lavender & the yellow are not very bright.
4.0,Good enough product. Very rough on the skin. Feels durable.
4.0,Very cute and unique bracelet
4.0,Fit as expected. Love the way it curve to my body. Make sure to order a size up for curvy girls. Your hips will never fit since there is no zip.
4.0,"These hit right below the knee for me (I'm 5'8"" but a lot of that height is in my legs, so maybe that's why?), which is lower than I expected considering the 'padded knee' part of the description. It doesn't much matter but if you're taller and looking for socks that come right up to your knee cap or something, these might not be it. They are only 40% wool so they are much softer than a lot of ski/snowboard socks I've worn in the past, which is nice. That said, they're pretty thin, so while they're very comfortable and have kept my feet warm in weather down in the high 30s/low 40s, I'm not sure I would wear them skiing if it was actually freezing out."
4.0,"The coast is a beautiful color and fits well. It looks a little boxy, which isn't great since I'm short, but it fits well and is very warm and comfortable. Overall I like it a lot, just wish it was a little less boxy looking."
4.0,"I’m 6’0, 185 lbs., 32” waist, 32”inseam, 42” chest and a regular length torso. Bought a M and it fits well. I sized down because I prefer slim fit. It fits me well and is slightly tight in the shoulders and chest (which is my preference) so order your regular size if you want a regular fit.<br /><br />One star off for these reasons. The fabric is thin and flimsy and I don’t expect to get a lot of longevity from the shirt. The hood drawstrings are very long and need to be managed if you’re eating. Most of all, don’t be fooled by the picture that shows the shirt hitting well below the waist. The picture guy must be very short because this shirt just barely hits below my waist. It’s acceptable but a bit short."
4.0,"pretty big, but nice gloves"
4.0,"The grip is a little less than I’d like.  They require fairly regular adjustment.  But for the price, they do the job."
4.0,goes great with what I bought it for
4.0,"Durable for the most part, love the color and the price"
4.0,"Good quality hat with strong lid, but runs a bit small on larger heads."
4.0,Cute dress and I got a lot of compliments on it. The pattern is fun.
4.0,"This is a very pretty dress, arrived quickly & looks like good quality. The only problem I had was that even with following their size guide the dress was still too big on me.<br /><br />I am 145 lbs ordered a size 10 and it was a bit too loose and I don’t have time to alter it so unfortunately I had to return it.<br /><br />I do recommend this seller and dress over all its a good purchase."
4.0,It is kind of thin material.
4.0,"It fits perfectly can be a little bit of a pain getting in and out I heard strings pop but it hasn’t come apart yet so I’m ok…will probably order another one cause it’s great for being around kids covers enough so I don’t feel like I’m embarrassing him,lol…"
4.0,Great bang for your buck. Hold up well. I've been using them for 2 months and no visible scratches so far.
4.0,Material is super thin.
4.0,"Love stainless jewelry --inexpensive, good-looking."
4.0,Not polarized or scratch resistant. You’re paying for the name otherwise same or lesser quality than many of the ten dollar versions.
4.0,"These are definitely &#34;cowboy style&#34; boots. I might have misinterpreted what round toe meant, but these are a bit more pointy than I expected. I ordered a 7.5, which is what I usually wear, but they're a little snug, so I'd suggest ordering half a size up. I really do like the breathability of these, especially since you can wear them both in summer, or in winter with socks. I picked the tan color since I don't have many ankle shoes in brown, and they are great for fall fashion, or festival style. I received these boots at a discounted price for my honest review. Thanks, Zooshoo!"
4.0,It’s a hat. Nothing more nothing less.<br />It looks sad. I haven’t worn it yet. It’s a bit large so if you’re a female with a small head … eh.
4.0,Tie clips. Hard to mess these up. Worked as I expected.
4.0,Pretty but light weight.
4.0,"I really like it, but it's hard to get off.  LOL.  The molded cups make me feel a little like Madonna, but it's very slenderizing."
4.0,Bought these because I needed support in my household slippers - They gave me great support and I even can wear them outside occasionally.  Great purchase for me.
4.0,"Good quality, I am5'4'' 130ish and I got a med, the waist is a bigger than I would have thought, which I like."
4.0,A bit on the small size. Good quality fabric and true color
4.0,Finally a solution that works to use a regular watch band with the gear S2. It is a bit tricky to finally get connected but after a month it is holding up perfect.
4.0,As with many Asian products of this kind of product sold on Amazon these ran way too small.  Had to return.
4.0,This outfit is nice but the capris are little snug in the rear if you are curvaceous. The colors are good and the material is good.
4.0,Great item! Love the quality and fit of the dress. Exactly as pictured. Because I’m a little bigger in the back I ordered up and it worked and I’m very happy with color and style
4.0,Like them. Great quality for the price. Sits high like some other reviewers have mentioned but definitely good quality. Super light and works well. Nice zippered &#34;hard&#34; case with a clip to attach to backpack when not needed anymore.
4.0,Band could be a little bigger. Muscular arms may be a little big for the standard size match
4.0,"Pretty small, but my son likes the warmth"
4.0,"Upon opening it from its plastic packaging, the smell of the clothing is really strong and smelled....smelled really bad! I'm not really sure how they could send something like this to a customer!<br /><br />I immediately hand washed and let it hang dry.<br /><br />Okay , so after! The pattern and design is really beautiful. The neutral nude color is really nice.<br /><br />I got compliments when going outside! I took the pictures when I first had gotten it ...yes I know ... It smelled lol<br /><br />But overall, the quality is great , a bit rough but I love this cover up."
4.0,"So my first impression was a bit of disappointment because the size guide on the packaging is not identical to the one available here on Amazon. The S/M is for people just a bit shorter or lighter than I am based on the guide on the packaging vs my being within the sizing guide available online. The first pair I put on and was actually able to wear as tights, but considering how much I had to stretch them, opted to wear as leggings to preserve their life. They are quite comfortable and thick enough that I am afraid of getting runs just by looking at them wrong. The second pair though I didn't even bother trying to wear as tights (so they were not overly stretched) and yet by lunch time they were already developing holes at the seams, so there might be a mild quality control issue with this brand. Aside from that, these are a lot nicer than the cheap tights I've used in the past, but are maybe just a bit lower quality than the $50 tights I used to wear. I really like the convertible feature - besides allowing me to wear them despite buying the wrong size, it is also really nice to have some grips on slippery floors. The opening did sit in just the right spot on my foot so it would not be noticeable even with the most minimalist shoes yet is large enough to be useful when barefoot. The toes section easily becomes legging cuffs."
4.0,"was pretty,i liked it.no keyring received"
4.0,This shirt is super cute. It does run a little bit small. It is more of a women’s cut. I tend to prefer a unisex cut. The actual image on the shirt is vinyl. It is kind of thick and plasticky feeling. It washed fine and wears OK. But the vinyl is thicker than it really should be. And it isn’t as nice as a screen printed shirt.
4.0,I received the WRONG dress but it fits fine.
4.0,Turned my ears all red and itchy
4.0,"Everyone who has gotten the necklaces I have done, are happy with them.  They are a good deal for the price/quantity value"
4.0,They were pretty but a little to pale pink.  A brighter pink would have been better
4.0,I use this to pack cables into a carry-on when flying. Keeps things easier to manage. I like it
4.0,GORGEOUS best $3.00 i ever spent.
4.0,Beautiful pattern. Smaller than I expected though
4.0,"Received this today and while it’s a cute purse, I was a little disappointed that the chain part is an off gold color. I was expecting a silver color since that’s how it appears in the picture. I like the space it has to offer and it’s a comfortable fit. We shall see how it holds up..."
4.0,Nice Sandal but the flower was a bit too big for my granddaughters liking. Sent back.
4.0,Good fit Quality seems good.  A little lighter weight than I was hoping for.  But good overall.
4.0,"This is my first Seiko and I like the watch.  This watch would be a 5 star but due to the bracelet, I down graded it by a star.  The bracelet is cheap. I put this watch on a nato strap and it looks great."
4.0,"Positives-great size, durable soft material, moveable material, many compartments, well made<br /><br />Negatives-the color is described as “grey brown” but I’d say this is definitely more brown than grey. I bought thinking it was gonna have a more grayish tint but it really doesn’t.<br /><br />I like the purse in other areas though so I’m choosing to keep it."
4.0,The material of the dress is very good. I am 5'6 and an M size is perfect length but somehow a bit wide.
4.0,Very nice casual dress. I like it but it is a bit sheer so you may need a slip underneath.
4.0,"Best brand of tank tops, I've been through many. Can never have too many white tank tops."
4.0,Purse is the perfect size for everyday use. The material is sturdy. I wish there were more holes in strap to adjust it better but I can fix this myself. I highly recommend.
4.0,"very cute, but only lasted 2 months"
4.0,"It's beautiful for special occasions. and to take photos in. I looked everywhere for this after seeing it at a store, and finally found it!"
4.0,"Affordable, comfortable. Love the stretchy waist! The legs are not loose on my legs, but not skin tight either, which makes these shorts much more versatile."
4.0,"Love this outfit. It fits nicely, maybe a little bit smaller than expected, but as long as we don’t put it in the dryer it should last."
4.0,Nice jacket.  Packaged  well<br />Seems true to size. Is a X mas gift so hasn’t been worn yet
4.0,"The product works well when I need to wear mask while grocery shopping or doing garden works.  For these circumstances, it lasts pretty long.  However, when I used it for skiing, my glasses began to fog up after 2 hours.  I guess for the cold places, we need to re-apply it much sooner.  Still recommend it though"
4.0,"I like it and will wear it, but the color was not as deep of a burgundy as i hoped."
4.0,"Love them,!!"
4.0,A bit shorter than I expected from looking at the the picture but it fits good and when I tried it on the length was actually not too short. I am a 12M in jeans with a curvy hips and L was a good fit. Happy with the purchase
4.0,I really like these pants. The colors are nice and rich. I need to lose a few pounds to fit but I want to wear them so much I am on an exercise and eating plan already. Lol
4.0,"This bracelet is absolutely beautiful, it well fit pretty much any size since it’s adjustable my only this is with the stones were a little bigger. Come in a nice box so you can give it as a gift. I’m using mine for my wedding."
4.0,"This blouse is really cute! I am 5'5, 135lbs, and 34C, with an athletic build and the small was perfectly fine on me, just not quite tunic length. I definitely couldn't wear leggings with it and have it cover anything. The color is really beautiful, a true teal that looks really professional under my black and cream colored suit jacket. I am a huge stickler for the armpits not cutting into me and this top have plenty of room for movement without feeling like I'm restricted. The neck hole is snug so the top lays nicely against the chest, but is not uncomfortably tight. I often pair this with my skirt suit and jacket for a professional look, but I have also worn it tucked into jeans  with heels for a night out and I always get compliments!<br /><br />This is a really nice, versatile top to have in your closet!"
4.0,Plain but very comfortable
4.0,"Love the shirt! Ordered an XL and it's a little loose, wish I had ordered the next size up if they had it."
4.0,"Overall it is nice.<br /> It’s very stretch and decent quality.<br />Fair for the price I think.<br />Its colors are very vibrant, and it seems like it will probably last for a while."
4.0,Works well. A bit smaller for my husband.. but good
4.0,I love this dress. It is longer than most of the other suspender dresses. I have 5 others and this is the only one that does not need any spanks underneath. The zipper is really awful on this dress so be careful
4.0,"this top is so pretty, but is runs a bit big.  I kept to wear it with a cami."
4.0,"A little large for my 6'7"" , 160 pound body but OK.  Haven't tried with a belt yet but should improve.  Have to wiggle it on and off.  Good value for the money."
4.0,The colors are very pretty. The necklace is a lot longer than I thought which makes it very versatile to wear.
4.0,Use to nice fitting
4.0,"Much bigger that I expected, I wish it were a bit smaller."
4.0,"Over all great buy for your money, the necklaces are a bit stiff."
4.0,I love the style of this dress and the fit.  The color was a little off - more green than blue.  I would consider ordering again.
4.0,"This dress is so cute!  It is a little theatrical.  I got the medium, which is just a little large, particularly as there is stretch to the material.  I ordered the small to see if it fits better.  I'll update once it has arrived.  I don't know if the dress shrinks when washed.  I am about 5'2&#34; and weight 125.<br />The small fit well so I am keeping it."
4.0,Decent looking
4.0,"Dress is nice. If you have a heavier chest, this might not be for you or maybe you can size up. Material becomes see-through as it stretches."
4.0,"Purses are as advertised. I received two purses: (1)strawberry (2)unicorn with straps plus a snowman keychain. I bought these as a little something extra/stocking stuffer for a 10 year old girl. Purses have working zippers. They are lightweight with a beautiful mix of colors: red, blue, green, yellow, pink, purple and orange. Colors are the same in the front and back of the strawberry and snowman. The unicorn only has a mix of color in the front and solid pink in the back. Eyelash detail on the unicorn purse is a nice touch. The straps are less than an inch wide and more than 22"" long when shortened and more than 40"" when extended fully. Black plastic adjustable slide buckles are on both straps. Carabiner style keychain with push latch is at the end of the straps. Straps are soft and have images of donuts, ice cream, ice pops and unicorns on them-another nice detail. I noticed a slight rubber smell upon opening; hopefully it will subside. Overall, I am pleased with what I have. Let's see what she has to say about them."
4.0,Father in law really enjoyed this shirt. Will purchase again
4.0,Absolutely love this skirt. Really fun for going out on the town during fall or being funky around Halloween. I may wear it outside of those seasons though. Only thing is the elastic band is rather small before stretching. I'm a somewhat smaller person so I may not recommend it if you're a little on the curvier side.
4.0,"Me gusto y cumplió para lo que lo pedí, no puede usarse para pantallas tactiles"
4.0,It seemed to look larger in the pictures on line.
4.0,"fit as expected. was a little hard to get on at first but eventually fit. not sure if i lost inches off or not, will update"
4.0,Some of the colors got onto each other or I would have gave it 5 stars.  Guess no QC
4.0,"The fit and color was exactly what I was looking for, however I returned the item as it was pretty thin, and would  most likely have needed a slip to wear.  Ordered a size med, I'm 5 3, 140 lbs, hem went to mid knee on me.  Very soft material"
4.0,"Cute bathing suit, I would say the sizing chart is right on, I'm about an 8 and I got the L for sizes 8-10. It fits me perfectly, even in the top and I'm a 34b"
4.0,This is just what we needed for our sleeper-sofa in the guest room!
4.0,"I've been mostly using these as driving glasses and have found them to work reasonably well. But the first important note is that the tint, even at its darkest, is very light. So much so you hardly notice the transition from light to lighter. I'd say it's about the equivalent of 80-90% tint.<br /><br />Except these are also polarized. Meaning even with the bright summer glare, I'm able to drive or walk around without squinting. But still, good visibility when walking indoors or going from a dark to bright environment.<br /><br />These sunglasses have good build quality and are fairly comfortable for extended wearing. However, given the minimal change in tinting, you could just as easily get a standard pair of lightly tinted polarized glasses and probably not even notice the difference. Also, some of the pictures for the listing are misleading, as they indicate the glasses get much darker than they do.<br /><br />Just keep that in mind and if it will meet your expectations, it's a solid buy."
4.0,"Seriously top is like 40DDD and the padding is sewn along with the fabric. My girls are swimming in there. I'm 5'11"", 42D, 35"" waist, 45"" hips. They should have different bra sizes for each bottom size. Very sad, I was loving how it looked in the photo..."
4.0,"This is a beautiful dress, I just wish it fit a little better. The quality of the fabric and craftsmanship is very well done and I love the style of the sleeves and top.<br />I’m 5’7, W 26”, H 33”, 32-34A, 115lbs, ordered a X-Small.<br />Fit is strange. The bust is sort of loose (though I am pretty flat) - would look better on a B- then the waist is tight and from there it flares out rather large. Nice length though, fits me a bit above the knees.<br />Also, -IMPORTANT NOTE- The top is COMPLETELY sheer, which I like but, you’d definitely need a nude plunge bra or some nip covers.<br />I’d recommend this if you like the style enough to put in some alteration time/$, or if you just happen to have the perfect hourglass figure."
4.0,"Wanted to be Crowley from Good Omens for Halloween. These sunglasses worked fine for that, but I doubt I'll wear them daily now that Halloween is over. Flipping the side parts in and out when I put the glasses on and off is a little cumbersome for regular use."
4.0,Trust the title of leggings. Only for yoga or for casual wear. They are not sweat proof but they are so soft and comfortable.
4.0,Keep your ears warm and can wear with a stocking hat on
4.0,"3 sets of stainless steel earrings for $8? Thats a steal. You can't get an accessory these days for that price. I have 5 holes in my ears and am constantly loosing earrings or just changing stuff around. I really like the gold and black ones, they silver isn't really my thing, however it is nice. I think they are better for a second hole and not so much a first hole, but that is really just my own style preference.<br /><br />Pro:<br />Nice finish<br />Small<br />Smooth back that does stab your head like traditional earrings<br />3 pairs<br />Very popular and trendy today<br /><br />Con:<br />I wish they had a little more weight to hem.<br /><br />Overall I recommend this product for anyone looking for an inexpensive earrings stud. I RECIEVED THIS PRODUCT AT A DISCOUNT IN EXCHANGE FOR MY HONEST REVIEW."
4.0,"I really like this sweater, but when sweaters come in a vacuum sealed package it is difficult to get the wrinkles out."
4.0,"Fit great, feels great. Needed it as a quick cover up. I am a S/M and it's a little big. If you were XL+ it wouldn't fit well (I just lost a bunch of weight and as a former XL.. I can tell ya)."
4.0,"Daughter loves it, but wrinkles bad after wash"
4.0,They are nice jeans. They were too long but other then that fit nice
4.0,"The tank top is a nice, ""dressy"" material. The lace is well done except for a few loose/frayed strings.<br /><br />Long enough for 5' 10"" tall and still tuck into jeans or wear with leggings without it looking like a crop top.<br /><br />The material is slightly see-through and would need a tank top underneath usually."
4.0,Although the hat was a little big on me it didn't present any issues. It keeps my head and ears pretty warm. I love it.
4.0,My husband really likes these briefs; they provide enough support but are cool and comfortable.
4.0,Warm but zipper is on the opposite side that is prefers.
4.0,"Overall: Love the boots!<br />Problems: they run small in the shaft and small in the foot. I normally wear a 9.5W and had to return the 9.5W for a bigger size. Because I couldn't wait any longer I ordered both a 9.5 WW (extra-wide) and a 10 WW (extra-wide). Amazon was out of those sizes so I ended up ordering from endless(dot)com. Problem #2 the molded piece forming the heel is very hard and can be painful. Of course it IS completely covered but I still feel it, even with my cushioned socks. I only notice when I sit in the car for extended periods, I think from the angle of my foot, it's bearable as I reposition my foot for relief. However, I would say this is a flaw in the design.<br /><br />Overall these were/are beautiful! There is a combo of shearling and wool that they really should show in photographs as it is so soft and inviting. It extends the full shaft of the boot and extends even on top of the foot, a feature I love as it keeps my feet warm. I worried about damp feet from another's reviewers experiences with moisture leaking in from the zipper(?) I have been knee deep in snow and sloshed in more than a few puddles and as yet no wet feet!<br />Everyone comments on these boots (brown combo) and wants to know were I found them. They are spendy but hopefully will last me a few years of winter wear. Let me just say that I had to buckle down and spend for these as I have long legs, wide feet and 17"" calves. These were the only option I could find that kept me warm in a skirt and fit well.<br /><br />PS the laces are really really long and weird but once I adjusted for fit I tied it off into a tight bow and tucked them in the criss-cross portion to keep out of the way. Now I only use zippers."
4.0,"Pretty and well made, but it did not look well on me as I had hoped. I had to return, I was searching for a dress below my knee. I'm 5'5&#34;"
4.0,"These leggings are perfect for working out or wearing out and about. Thick, good quality material. There was a small hole in the seam on the waist but I love the leggings so I’m not too bothered by it."
4.0,One of my favs to wear. Very soft and comfortable with nice pockets. My only dislike is they are quite thin and show my underwear outline.
4.0,"I've had these for a couple months now. They are warm, comfortable, and run my touch devices great! The bows are not attached very well. I popped one off the 2nd day I had them and the other about a month and a half into owning them. They are easy to reattach if you are able to use a needle and thread. I wear them almost ever day.<br />I wear an iwatch 38 with the small/medium band on the last hole and the gloves fit around my watch."
4.0,"I seem to go thru a lot of glasses, losing or breaking them. These are well worth the money. They fit well and are designed pretty good. Yes I will buy again!"
4.0,"Great feel. Little bigger band than I though based on image, but it's still a great fit."
4.0,Love this little summer dress
4.0,Fits good. Stretchy material. Like the belt. The sleeves are a bit too big. Color is right on. Overall good dress
4.0,I like it. It was what it said it would be. It didn't have any information on whether it was waterproof or not and shipping took forever but otherwise I'm happy with it.
4.0,Love the rings I ordered.
4.0,Love the tan color and the Velcro straps. Priced just right
4.0,"I am 5'3"" about 170# and purchased a size 10.<br />The fit is great however the length is horrid. the inner layer hits at about floor length however the outer tulle layer is about an inch longer than inner layer. If I'm walking the tulle drags and I step on it. For the price I'm happy with it but will have to pay someone to hem it.<br /><br />Also the beaded waist piece doesn't go all the way around."
4.0,"Easy to wear and good to protect the baby's legs, do not need the socks again."
4.0,"The leather on this handbag is beautiful.  However, if you like a roomy bag, this isn't it.  It's small."
4.0,"Love the bright colors for my tropical vacation. I was thinking it zipped all the way down but only 1/2 way. I usually wear a medium but went with a large. Just to help anyone looking to order, I’m 5’2 and 140lbs. I plan to lose 10 more lbs by vacation but it it’s a tad on the snug side but not to bad. I’m wearing black swim bottoms when we go snorkeling"
4.0,Cute pendant!
4.0,I bought these socks for my son-in-law for Christmas. He watched soccer with his dad on Saturdays. I thought they'd be fun to wear while watching the games.
4.0,cool-looking. works good fgr the low price
4.0,"I loved it but it was too small. She used it a few times and then it didn't fit anymore. The color and design is fabulous. I didn't give it five stars because of the size, running small."
4.0,Gave these to a friend and she loved them!
4.0,"I think that this is very cute and I love it.  My only issue with it was after you break it in two, the edges are a little sharp.  Not a big deal, but wish it wasn't like that."
4.0,"I’ve only worn these three times, doing yard work when the yard was wet and soggy. Can’t comment on durability, but they seem sturdy—have a good weight and feel. I wear size 10, and bought an XL (suggested for sizes 10-13).  I’ve used them over Sketchers athletic shoes, which are a little bulky, and they fit OK, a little too large, but they do go on easily. The sole seems OK, but I would avoid walking on rocks, or anything jagged, for fear they would puncture. To me they look a little work-shoeish. Don’t think I’d wear them over dress shoes unless I had to. I do like the height. They do what I need them to do. So far, satisfied. Would recommend."
4.0,It is perfect for the holidays
4.0,"Just what I expected love it, it got pockets!!"
4.0,"I love this shirt, got many compliments. There is no give to the shirt so sizing has to be correct. I wear a small and sometimes a medium. I have a size A chest 🙄. I bought a medium thankfully and the sleeves at the armpit area were just a little snug. So if you have a chest or muscle arms, this shirt is not for you."
4.0,"Nice quality, as I expected from OR.  Just a little too small."
4.0,Fit as expected.  Soft after wash.  Beware of the chemical smell after opening the product.  Had to wash them twice before I could wear.
4.0,"This PJs are true to size, but be aware, this is not for girls with big boobs."
4.0,"Nice watch! The brass is a little..gum ball machine ish. The band is a little thinner than I’d like to see on a mans watch. But it keeps good time, and is pretty nice to look at! Not a bad buy!"
4.0,"I love them so much, but definitely have to be careful.  Drop them and it's day goodbye. Bend very easy"
4.0,To big and was not expecting lveclore on shoe
4.0,"These are exactly what I was looking for in a water-safe, slip-on summer shoe. Unfortunately it’s a bit too narrow and short for my toddlers squishy feet."
4.0,I wear a med and ordered a large & fit was too tight for my liking & gave to my daughter who loves it
4.0,It's a cute bathing suit top.  But it runs slightly on the small side.
4.0,"it works pretty good but you can tell it’s not made from super high quality material, there’s already a fray in the thread on the air tag holder. that being said it does the job and has worked well for me over the last 1.5 month or so, the clip works, it holds your cards well"
4.0,Aligns well.  Perfect fit.  Material not a comfortable as IntellSkin
4.0,"When placing the order I noticed that it did not have a size chart and was worried that it was not going to fit me. I received it fast and it came in a black package. I noticed on the package that it is unisex which is for men and women and it fits up to a 42&quot; waist. When I took out the waist trimmer out from the package it felt so soft and very stretchy. The inside feels like rubber and on the outside it feels like soft fabric. I put it on and it feels great, with no itching or rolling up. It feels so comfortable and you can adjust it to how tight you want it to be. I have been jogging at nights and when I get home I notice how sweaty I am where I have it on. What is so great about this product is that it provides weight loss during exercising and it also supports your lower back during your workouts and it keeps your muscles warm. I received this product for free or for a discount in exchange for my honest opinion. My opinion is 100% mine."
4.0,"I love the color and quality is nice. The top fits but the bottom very small. It still fits but i wish it were a tad bigger. Reference, 5&#34;4 125 lbs 34A"
4.0,Great gift for mt daughters 4th birthday.  She loves to help in the kitchen. I personalized it for her but painting on it.
4.0,"Great bracelets.  Nice material, durable. However the black one did come apart where it attaches so that sucks. Good buy for the price tho"
4.0,"A very nice necklace and chain, but the cut edges of the charm were a little sharp and the writing too small to read very easily."
4.0,[[VIDEOID:45ad42e5759ea89826ad82f603f9e65d]] Fits great. Love no top button. Good quality materials. Only qualm is the center stitching and velcro patch are sewn on a little crooked. Doesn't effect functionality but it does effect my OCD. Otherwise very happy.
4.0,"It's the perfect small bag, nylon makes it easy to clean. I don't use the foldover pouch area, as it still takes up space in the main purse. I do use the rear slit pocket for small items"
4.0,Material isn't a high quality but the dress worked well for the event.
4.0,Love it.. nice Kurta
4.0,"I love this dress but the only complaint I have is that I had to shorten it about 3 inches because of how long it is. I'm 5' 3"", so I'm on the short side. If you're above 5' 6"", I think you'd be okay on length.  Otherwise, the dress is incredibly comfortable, very vibrant, and is a great quality!"
4.0,"The bracelet is not a set size so I found that nice to use as a gift.  It has a pretty design, pretty much looks like the picture.  I enjoy the mood color changes.  It makes for a interesting piece of jewelry.  The person I gave it to loved it."
4.0,Love them. Very cute. We use themvinsteadb ofv pants for easy diaper changes on our 6 month old. Shes in the 9850th percentile for weight with chunky legs but the stay in place without cutting off the circulation. We think they're adorable!
4.0,Very cute…The max age for this would be an average size 8-9 yr old not for a small adult.
4.0,"I actually love this dress, I am normally a size XS so naturally the small would be a tad big on me, however, adding a belt will be the perfect touch. The material is light weight and you must wear nude undergarments, but that is to be expected with any white/light color material. It is a little long on me for being only 5'1&#34; but again to be expected. Ordering clothes online is risky but I am overall please with the dress."
4.0,"It looks nice, it is big and roomy"
4.0,Decent shirt no complaints good material
4.0,Cute dress but the white is VERY see-through!
4.0,"I ordered these bracelets and it is well worth its buy.  Nothing too extravagant.  Simple but cool.  If you're in to these type of string bracelets, its very cool to wear.  Since its not too feminine and it came with two, I gave the other to my boyfriend. He looks perfectly fine with it on.  Overall, any gender can wear it and it's worth the low price.  The only downside is that it took a full week to get here."
4.0,While I really love these yoga pants(I even ordered a second pair). I am somewhat disappointed that after a few months of owning them some pin sized holes have started to appear in one of my pairs.
4.0,"I should have read the production information closer, the front is shorter than the back."
4.0,This skirt is very cute but it is see through. Just  ware some spanks underneath. I have had no trouble with stitching or quality.
4.0,"Great shirt, comfortable and light weight.  It is not a bright white.  It is closer to an off white or winter white.<br />Great shirt."
4.0,The shoes fit good only issue I have is the packing. They weren't bent up bad I was able to get the creases out other then that I like them.
4.0,It's very comfortable but kinda tight. It's a really nice shirt and have gotten a lot of compliments.
4.0,Great for short uses. Didn’t work for me for longer than 30 min. They will start to steam and drip.
4.0,Just as described- will be perfect for patriotic days!
4.0,Beautiful coat. I wear a medium and the XL was too small. But beautiful
4.0,"Cute and fun dress. Fit was great, im 5'9 and 200lbs and it hit me just above my knees. Although im concerned with the quality of the fabric, i wonder how it will wash and if it will pill. Other then that im happy with this dress."
4.0,"Great, for the price. The wrinkles are a simple fix. I love the pattern but it's not a heavy-duty hat. I don't expect it to last very long. I bought it for Halloween but am excited to actually use it gardening or at the beach."
4.0,"I bought these for my husband's birthday, but unfortunately they were too small for his wrist. He really wanted to love them. They are nice for me."
4.0,"These are a little tighter than what I expect out a normal medium t-shirt. Otherwise they are perfectly fine. No color fade after multiple washes, plenty comfortable. Looks good. I'd get it again."
4.0,"I am not going to give this a low review because of the sizing issue.  Because the shirt itself is great quality, but it runs very small. I would go up two sizes from what you normally get.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that I feel the seller should tell people purchasing it in the States that this goes by Asian sizes.  Had I known this I would have bought it in an appropriate size as I buy clothes for myself from Asia all the time.  I just get two sizes up and they fit perfectly.  I got my fiance an XL as that is his normal size, but next time I order from here I will get a 2XL or 3XL to be safe."
4.0,Love it but took forever to get shipped to me
4.0,"I am 5'6"" and 136 lbs. I got a small and could probably have used an extra small for it to fit me more closely so I definitely think this runs a little large. It is really comfortable material though and thick enough for a fall breeze not to feel too chilly. Overall, I like it. I just wish it fit a bit better."
4.0,"I bought the Cheshire cat pants, very fun design. Looks judy like the Cheshire cat from Alice in Wonderland! They are very cute but I was surprised by how sheen they were. More dance style fabric. Soft and silky to the touch as a dance costume would be. The fit is perfect on me! I'm 5'3&#34; 125-130# and they fit great. A touch on the long side but I'm a shortie! They go all the way down to my socks. Very comfy and very VERY stretchy. They are two layered, the inner layer being white so when you bend or stretch, the white inner layer shows through. They are NOT see through. Although they appear to be due to the inner layer being white. I'm not a fan of the white showing through, giving the illusion of being see through..I don't think that's worth knocking off a star for though. I honestly give these a 4.5 stars but I like to always round up! think I might buy another pair but maybe white this time. That way both layers match each other.<br />I was unable to upload pictures on this review but you can see them here: https://www.amazon.com/review/RRALER0ZR495S/ref=cm_cr_rdp_perm?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01DHRHWHG<br /><br />I received this item at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review"
4.0,"The shorts are see through, but not too bad. They fit amazing and are super cute on!"
4.0,Gloves tore but I can sew it.  Crown was hard to assemble but I did it. okay for price
4.0,Fun glasses and love how they look with no frame.
4.0,Very Cute..bought with toddler star wars socks. For grand baby to be...parents are star wars ffan..gonna love these!
4.0,These are easy and affordable if you don’t want to actually pierce your nose.
4.0,Nice repleacement for orthodics
4.0,Have had issues with ordering pants in the past so instead of ordering my size I purchased a size larger and they fit very well. They are a bit long so I will have to wear taller heels but over all they fit and feel great on the body.
4.0,"The other item I have is their long sleeve jersey, and it keeps me nice and warm on cold days. This jersey is thinner material, and the sleeves are ⅓ length.<br /><br />This short sleeve Turnhier cycling jersey is 80% polyester and 20% spandex, and it feels nice to the touch, and it has the standard 3 pockets on the back allowing you to store a phone, keys, credit cards etc., as well as a water bottle (or two).<br /><br />I am 130lbs with a 29” waist and measure 5’7”, I got the small jersey which fits really well, and at the back, the hemline sits just below the cheeks of my bum, and at the hemline rises somewhat as it makes its way towards the front where it zips together with a full length zip. Overall it is a snug fit, and there is a rubber grip all along on the inside of the hemline to make sure the jersey stays in place on your ride.<br /><br />The zipper works well, and it won’t just open of its own accord, but it is somewhat challenging to get the insert into the receiver because it is so small, and I would prefer to see a larger zipper used there.<br /><br />The design on the front and back as it makes you visible if you are riding at night, and the reflective trim along the top of the pockets increases your safety.<br /><br />The jersey is great regards being constructed from breathable fabric.<br /><br />PROS:<br />Great feeling fabric<br />Reflective components and bright graphics and ensure you will be seen at night<br />3 pockets on the back<br />Materials are good quality and the stitching is strong and shows no sign of breaking<br />Rubber grip on hemline to keep jersey in place<br /><br />CONS:<br />Like my other Turnhier jersey, the Zipper components are pretty small, and a little difficult to use. I would prefer to see a larger zipper used.<br />The fabric used in the collar is so soft it just flops over and loses its shape<br /><br />SUMMARY:<br />Overall it’s a great jersey that I will likely use every weekend. I don’t know what price this will go for, but if it is around $25, then it would be appropriately priced.  The company also offers a  90 days free return and money back so you can buy without any worries. I am guessing most people who read the reviews on this jersey and buy one will not need to take advantage of the guarantee."
4.0,I’m petite/with short legs and these were not overwhelmingly long on me.
4.0,Cool shoes but they only had whole sizes so instead of my usual 7.5 I ordered an 8.  They are slightly too big but I bought some heel inserts to stop them from falling off my feet when I walk and that seemed to do the trick.  For only having whole sizes I deducted one star for the added expense ($8) of heel inserts..
4.0,"I like the length of this shirt and the flattering design. The reason i can't give it 5 stars - somewhat low quality of fabric, definitely not as shown in the picture and not a soft smooth to the touch texture that you would expect from 'rayon, cotton' type of fabric.<br /><br />About sizing: i wear xl and ordered 5x, because i was afraid that asian sizes run way too small, but that was not the case. So the shirt has a very loose fit on me, more like a robe than a shirt honestly, but i don't mind, it still looks great, not baggy or anything."
4.0,"You get what you paid for. The loops on the side I already had to cut off because the tread was not finished on them.<br />The sleeve holes are rather large but the bottom line is my daughter can go bananas and do whatever she wants in this pretty red dress and I am ok with it because it did not cost a fortune.<br />I like to go for better quality rather than cheap stuff, but in this case, I wanted a nice Christmas picture out of it (done) and many hours of play time for my daughter (to be continued)."
4.0,"Cute, comfy sweater.  Looks exactly as pictured.  I do wish it was a bit longer, but I am tall!"
4.0,"I like this one.  Shiny and seems sturdy. Great for small to medium pendants.<br />I like chains that aren't so flashy or bold that they detract from the pendant,<br />and this fits that description to a tee."
4.0,Super cute and comfortable.  My daughter loves them!
4.0,These are so cute. Bought them as a gift but will be buying myself some soon. Wish they came in additional patterns or plain also.
4.0,"I was super hesitant to buy these, because the lack of reviews and such, but I really needed new bras (and fast) so I went ahead and bought them. I love them so much! They're true to size for me (34B) and I love how I look in them! They're comfortable, not a bother at all. The only thing I don't like are the straps. I wear spaghetti strap shirts literally all the time and the straps are thin, meaning I like my bra straps to be thin as well so it's not super noticeable. But the straps on these are pretty wide and don't look great with my favorite shirts. Other than that, really nice bras and they look exactly as pictured."
4.0,"This zuvelli tummy high waisted workout leggings are nice. It's light and doesn't feel like I have anything on when I wear them. The bottom clings to my legs without feeling suffocating but it doesn't feel like I have tummy support in the waist area. Being that they claim to be tummy control, I was expecting more hold for my mom pouch. It may be that way because of the type of material. I'm 5'7"", 208lbs and chose the extra large and it fits me well. The front comes up just under my ribs and the back comes to about just below my waist line. It did slide down during my workout but only about an inch but it never rolled down and kept my pouch covered. I know y'all are wondering, so yes, it passed the squat test. It doesn't even show the lining of my underwear, but for some reason it showed the tag so I ripped it out. I feel like due to the style of stitching it makes my butt look weird and smaller. Before wearing it, I machine washed it in cold water with like colors and air dried. The material looks the same as it did when I pulled it from the package. The side pockets are great and I can see them being very useful for when Igo on runs. The pockets are deep enough for keys and your phone. I think these are great for spring or summer jogging and indoor workouts. I'll update if anything changes."
4.0,"Well made, but not as full as shown in picture."
4.0,Fit well and kept the sun off my face during our hike!
4.0,So far so good. The gloves keep my hands (including fingers) warm. It's not yet gotten below zero so I cannot speak to extreme cold. The gloves are comfortable.
4.0,"Spent 6 hours on the river the day I got them. They performed well. I put toilet paper in the pockets to test and it stayed dry. They didnt over heat. Seem sturdy. Reinforced  in all right places and had full range of movement in legs for scrambling the banks. I'm 5'10"" , 200 lbs, size 10 boot, pants size 36w x 31L. 42 "" waist measured. A medium fit just right, even over jeans if I wanted. I'd give 5 stars but I dont know yet how durable but they're a safe bet I think."
4.0,The dress fit really well and looked great except it was kinda poofy at the seam where the belt goes which did not accentuate my waist. I ended up getting a different waist belt that was a little wider to cover the poofy seam and it worked perfectly.
4.0,"Nice material, but a it large."
4.0,"I love them! They’re so cute and have a unique look to them. The only complaint I have is that the nose pads aren’t the most comfortable, but they’re not horrible! I would recommend these."
4.0,Very nice key chain. I would buy another one if I ever needed to.
4.0,2 of the bee's were missing stone's. Amazon did give me a credit towards recording.<br />It's a ashame too. The bee's are beautiful.
4.0,"After reading that last review, I wonder if we were sent 2 different rings...Mine was very nice. Its a lovely stone for what you pay and it looked like any rainbow moonstone I've ever seen."
4.0,Item is as illustrated. Color combination is unusual and striking. Could wear for business or casual. Fabric is good quality.
4.0,decent support in top (42C) Not too bad length would have likes 1 inch longer. Adjustable straps a plus.
4.0,Either it's a tad small or I'm a tad larger than I'd like to admit. I'm 5'2 and about 140. I typically wear a medium top but the reviews steered me to purchase a large. The fit is ok but I'll hang dry to be in the safe side!
4.0,Has enough slots for all my stuff.  Arrived and smelled a little chemically but I let it air out for a day and it works great.
4.0,My wife ordered this her name is Roxie
4.0,"I got so many compliments on my leggings!  I was a little disappointed with the quality, as the crotch blew out on my first use.  I ran the seam through my sewing machine to repair, and they seem ok now.  I am not a huge fan of the feel of the fabric.  I'm more accustomed to LLR and the like, and these feel more slippery, like traditional Spandex.  The print is super cute, but it does stretch a little bit in the &#34;tighter&#34; areas (ahem- hips and thighs especially), but I only wear leggings under dresses or long shirts, so it does not show (on me, anyway)."
4.0,"The swimsuit is really cute, the different colour blocks help to make me feel slimmer!  I have to hitch up the shoulderless side to be safe as it really does not have much support.  Overall it is a really good look and I will probably buy another colour for future use."
4.0,Follow the fitting guide and it's all good...pouch could be a little bigger ...they make my legs look even better...
4.0,Product was a lot larger than I expected. It was delieved on time. They were exactly as described and are beautiful. I just wish the size was in inches not centimeters
4.0,"Loved how soft and cute this was, but it was very snug and I had to send it back."
4.0,Not bad for metal alloy; stamped on both sides.
4.0,"I love this, the only problem is the ties are too short but that’s because I like to wrap them around and tie in front. A $1 roll of red ribbon and five minutes with a needle and thread fixed that and I love it!"
4.0,Decent am I happened to get it on sale so even better.
4.0,"Looks just like picture, it’s a little shorter than I thought, I’m 5’7”. Quality is descent for the price."
4.0,Pretty top just sized small.
4.0,I bought this as a gift and I thought it would come with a better packaging than a white small nylon bag.
4.0,It's light and comfortable on my wrist. Very pleased with this purchase.
4.0,"A very nice addition to anyone's accessories drawer, I like the fact that they are both adjustable and it stays  in place very nicely.  The only thing that I didn't like was ratlle noise of the little bells every time you move the hand, I think I would rather had beads instead of bells, other than that the bracelet is a keeper...Very fast shipping.  Thank you!"
4.0,Wish dress was longer. Need larger sizes.
4.0,"Falls below the knee and fits as expected, although the arm holes were a little big at the bottom. I'm 5'3, typically a size 4-6 in dresses, and bought the navy in a small. A nice, heavier material; not see through."
4.0,"LOVE the medallion portion and the little chest for safe keeping, just a bit disappointed with the different colored chain, also the chain broke the second day of wearing."
4.0,"Sturdy, attractive. Hard for toddlers to walk in."
4.0,"I love the colors, the first one I got lost the metal on the front"
4.0,"Ok, I totally changed my mind.  At first, I didn't like that it didn't cover my butt but if you shift it back just a little it's ok.  I like the look a lot.  For the price, it's really great.  The material is pretty soft, not scratchy."
4.0,"I really like this design of a wallet.<br />The magnectic clip is nice and strong and hold money perfectly.  The other side of the wallet has a nice see thru screen so it makes it nice to keep your ID in for easy access.<br />It does have a few slots to store important cards in and the slots are big enough to get them in and out of with ease.<br />Quality of leather is great, and does not have that weird odd smell.<br />I did not find any flaws in the leather or in the stitching.<br />I received this wallet for free for testing and reviewing purposes.  This is my honest unbiased opinion and have come to it by using this wallet myself."
4.0,Great shirt. It's light which is great for the summer and fits well
4.0,"The sleeves are long enough to cover my hands if it's cold while I'm jogging. I like to have long shirts and this covers my waist, but rides up a bit sometimes. I'm satisfied with this top and will probably purchase again in a different color."
4.0,"Good fit, super soft. Great buy for the money"
4.0,Pockets are hard to get into.
4.0,The finish wasn’t really good: some of the sequins had fallen off in the package before they even arrived. Overall they are cheaper than the ones at Disney so they do the trick.
4.0,I wear Capri workout pants daily because I’m a fitness director. These are super convenient for me to slip in quick instead of wearing another layer of pants.
4.0,Cute sneakers. My son currently wears a toddler 6. These sneakers in a size 6 caused blisters on all his toes. I am therefore sending them back and ordering a 7.
4.0,Finally the Lance Mountain version from my middle school dreams. I love these.
4.0,Cute. Hard to stay put up my ear. I use the phone all day and had to adjust them constantly.
4.0,"After reading all the negative reviews online I was very skeptical. I have a long running history of being the hardest sleeper I know. I’ll sleep through anything and be none the wiser. I went ahead and bought this product because I had nothing to lose, and boy was I wrong. I’ve been using it for about a week now and I haven’t needed a sound alarm at all. I’ve been able to wake up and leave my partner sleeping, I’ve been able to be more productive and I haven’t been late to work a single time."
4.0,Cheap material (I’m  not too surprised though)  and so now I have to iron it because of how the creases didn’t go away when I got it. The print on it is high quality though at least.
4.0,Looks very nice on my girl. I gave it a four because of the material being light.
4.0,Husband just looking for comfort. These really work
4.0,Super cute. Go a size up if you have big arms.
4.0,Its a great hat for keeping warm
4.0,"I'm 5'10&#34; 200lbs Ordered a 12/14 I love it! I wish the boob part was more secure, maybe an underwire? Or a built in bra? but honestly it fits and that's all I wanted"
4.0,"the dress is nice and fits me well, I wear XL, I'm 5.2 and weigh 225 pounds. You going to feel sexy with this dress no matter you size."
4.0,Purchased a small for my husband who golfs. It was a little big on him but nonetheless it's a nice shirt.
4.0,"A good dress. Didn't fit quite as well as the photos looked. I know all body shapes are different, but the waist is so high I imagine this is true for most people"
4.0,Very stylish and comfortable with adjustable straps.
4.0,"I am a size 4. I ordered a size medium they fit great but I would normally order a small. Also I ordered the gray pair however they look more blue than gray. Otherwise I have no complaints. They are soft, comfortable, squat proof, not see through, don’t roll or pinch."
4.0,They are okay. The sole is nicely padded and very comfortable. But the straps are too far back it kind of looks a little silly. I will wear them to the pool/beach and around the house
4.0,"Love this dress!  I’m 5’7”, 130 and a pretty standard medium. The medium fits well, just above the ankles but I can pull it down a bit so it doesn’t seem short."
4.0,"Very sexy, though the seams on the arms pop as soon as you stress them even a little. Don't expect this to be a shirt you wear all the time due to seams breaking during both wear and wash but, it's super cute and accommodates large chested women like myself."
4.0,Great jacket except its arm length isn't suited for every arm lol. Mine are a little short because I'm short and the sleeves extend far past my hands. After a few washes its manageable though.
4.0,Dress fit perfect. Comfortable and nice but quality is a little easy to snag. But still lovely dress.
4.0,"I bought these to replace a similar pair (same brand/size) that I've had for 3+ years.  I wore these around the house for a bit to break them in.  After the first long-term use, it seems that the straps rub differently than my older ones, resulting in blisters on the insides of my feet behind the ball of my foot.  I'm hoping they continue to break in and the issue goes away, or I quickly develop new calluses for the new contact-points.<br /><br />The quality/construction is solid, as I would expect for this price-range.  I'm not sure that the bottle opener is necessary, but maybe someday I'll be grateful it's there.<br /><br />For those first-time orderers, I recommend ordering a half-size larger than your normal size for sneakers."
4.0,Love the thickness and cotton quality. This will really be a life saver when winter worsens.
4.0,Nice material very soft and sexy. Smaller than the last  time I  ordered
4.0,The only thing I am disappointed about is the length of the top.  I wish it were longer.
4.0,"These are not see through. Fabric is super soft and comfy. I followed what others said about sizing but found I that I should have sized down.  Mine were quite stretchy and fit below my knee like Bermuda shorts, which I'm fine with.  Good luck👍🏼"
4.0,Very nice style and perfect look around the office to switch things up. Very comfortable material. And...I love long sleeve dresses with pockets. Yellow usually looks so different online then in person but this dress looks the same.
4.0,The back is cute but the front is super weird it comes up high and sits strange and uncomfortable
4.0,"Love this, but the chain is not great, the heart and butterfly are so pretty."
4.0,Bought a size up after reading all the reviews but it was very large. The size up went all the way down to my knees - and I have a long torso.<br />Sent it back and ordered a medium. Fits great. I love the colors. The colors are super bold just like the picture.  Came quickly<br />Ordered a medium and it's perfect.<br />I'm 5'6&#34; with curvy hips. It's a good weight and comfy.I have a long torso. This hoodie goes just below my hips which makes it perfect for wearing with jeans or yoga pants.
4.0,"I love this top. I ordered the floral and the colors are so vibrant and beautiful! The material is a bit thin, but I like that for summer. I wouldn’t say it’s sheer, it doesn’t show anything off that it shouldn’t! My strapless bra works well underneath. I ordered the small and medium (I’m usually between sizes) and while I could have stuck with the small, the medium gave me a better length. The small was a little short so I’m sending that one back. Overall a very nice top!"
4.0,Beautiful color and quality. But smaller than expected. Nothing to lose sleep over. I would say they have a 3D effect. Nevertheless I can't wait to wear them to the Weeknd concert!
4.0,A good value for a strapless.
4.0,"Pretty mask, but sheds glitter like crazy."
4.0,"If I am doing anything more than riding in a car, these fall off. I love the style its so hard to find aviators without the nose pieces! The vision through them is fine they are just too wide for my head."
4.0,nice light weight fabric
4.0,"They're very beautiful. Good quality, weight and size. They are smooth and do not come off as 'delicate' - that being said, I can't wear them as a necklace because they pinch the hairs at the back of my neck. These are definitely more masculine and I think I'll be giving them to my husband. I love them, they're just not for me."
4.0,"This is a nice item. I was a little disappointed as it really is just a wallet. I moved my checkbook and cards to it, but now I carry two wallets as I have my money and other items that will not fit in here."
4.0,its kinda large for me but overall i like it.. got this at discounted price..
4.0,"I really like these Santa hats but they are made of a cheap material that could be irritating over time. Like I couldn't wear them all day. I this is just for a photo, or you are buying them for kids or something, I think they are great. Just keep in mind that they are pretty scratchy."
4.0,Not bad I like them and for the price I didn't expect much but was worth it to me.
4.0,"The glass bead itself is beautiful, and really does appear to have small galaxy suspended within it.  The small, short cord it came with is not strong enough for such a large, heavy bead."
4.0,"Could use holes on top, and rounder toe."
4.0,Love the dress. The fit was just right and the material is thick and of great quality. I have both the blue and black.
4.0,"I liked the vest, quality is okay, fits a little big."
4.0,"This bag is adequate size and seems only slightly smaller if not identical to the size of a supermarket shopping bag.<br /><br />The stuff pouch is sewn onto the bag and is hidden inside the bag when the bag is removed from the pouch. The bag fits tightly compressed into the stuff pouch and there is a drawstring with an adjustable gadget to keep the pouch closed. The pouch is removable from a keyring because the loop has a stud. It could also fit conveniently into a handbag.<br /><br />I'm not sure how durable the bag is because the handles are sewn onto the bag, however the fabric seems tough even though it is thin. The stitching is also solid and top notch.<br /><br />Because of environmental restrictions on the use of plastic bags (and the fact that some stores have voluntarily stopped the use of plastic bags,) this is a handy thing to have. It is also convenient for having on hand while walking through the mall, rather than having to lug around reusable shopping bags.<br /><br />It is also relatively expensive for a reusable shopping bag which can be bought at the supermarket for $1."
4.0,"I'm 5'8'' and 118 lbs.  I ordered small, but the product is somewhat large!  The packaging is great and the quality is perfect.  I would say, order a one size down or read some of the reviews by other people  :)<br /><br />DISCLAIMER:  I review some products that I get for free or discounted, however all of my reviews are held to a high ethical standard, honest, and  are my own opinions and are not for sale."
4.0,"This is an adorable and comfortable summer tank top. The waffle weave pattern adds a bit of flair to an otherwise ordinary wardrobe staple. It launders well on normal cycles and with like colors and materials. My only complaint is that the shirt does lose shape quickly as it’s being worn. After a few hours, it takes on a loose and somewhat frumpy appearance. I think a likely solution would be to size down in order to maintain rigidity throughout the day."
4.0,"The strap feels great, arrived fast and fit the watch very well. The Only critique I can give is that the color of the strap is slightly off.  The Bentley Tan in the amazon pic looks like a Camel light tan and what you get is more like a Honey Beige. The leather feels great and was very please at how it looked on my watch. Thanks and I do recommend this strap."
4.0,Just l little to short I’m 6’3”
4.0,"This works for sleeping, but the top is a bit tight (I'm admittedly large chested, though) and the pants are about perfect. I love the fabric as it is a little cooling and breathable."
4.0,"Extremely beautiful, looks like a million bucks. Fast shipping and was very happy with this product. Was able to put it on my watch and have been wearing it for 2 weeks. Good quality. I would purchase again."
4.0,"A bit see-through, but still cool."
4.0,Order a size up this was a little small on my 7 year old other then that it is awesome deadpool costume
4.0,super cute.  not too big and not too small. perfect for gifting.
4.0,Really cute.  Ok quality for the price
4.0,Great but runs small
4.0,"Fits great around waist, but large at top. I should be able to make it work with safety pins"
4.0,Material looks like sweatshirt material
4.0,"Very pretty, worked well on large chest. Cinched nicely at waist."
4.0,Pretty good. Few loose threads but all the buttons are in tact & attached. Fits as expected & generally looks as pictured. It even comes with an extra button in case 1 pops off.
4.0,"Cute but if you are big in the bust I would recommend going a size up. The material is kind of flimsy, but you get what you pay for."
4.0,"Great fashion belt medallion is nice, purchased as a gift."
4.0,One of these socks fits great and the other is a little big. One seems like the right size and the other one is about an inch longer. i even washed them to see if maybe it was just stretched out but it is still bigger. They socks help but they do look weird being different lengths and one goes up higher on my heel than it should. Other than that they are great and are a pretty breathable fabric.<br /><br />Disclosure: I received this item at a discount or free for my honest review.
4.0,"I just received the necklace today, so I cannot comment on wearing it. It is very pretty, albeit a little on the gaudy side, but against a black top, I believe it will make the desired statement. I am used to wearing more chunky pieces, so the daintiness of this necklace will add a different flavor to my collection. The accompanying earrings are a joke, but I didn't know they were included, so giving them to a child who owns a doll with pierced ears will put me on someone's 'favorite' list. I am looking forward to wearing the tassel necklace and am sure that in the dreary winter months, I will delight in the bling it will add to my outfits.."
4.0,Nice but ran small and shrinks easily.
4.0,"It’s a little big for a small female, and made of cheap material. But for me, it was perfect price range for a hat I only wear once a year to the rodeo. Don’t expect to be blown away by the quality, but it will make your outfit very cute"
4.0,I am using this gogles to swim in my pool. I didn’t like the look of them on my face.
4.0,"Good quality, will buy from you again!"
4.0,Like description.
4.0,I really like the watch... But it's be nice if the straps weren't silicone. When I'm working I feel like I have to move the watch around a lot because it sticks like a suction cup to my skin. Especially when it's hot. They needs leather.. Or some other material straps. I hardly ever where this watch now. Only when I really need to.
4.0,"This 18 karat gold plated bracelet is made of small, faceted gold beads that catch the light to glitter and shine on a delicate gold chain.  A larger, flat bead slides on the chain to make it adjustable for any size wrist and to make getting it on and off an easy process.  The tiny Savorski crystals are set in gold tubes that almost overwhelm them.  Just slightly larger crystals might have highlighted the bracelet better.  Still, this bracelet is quite lovely and looks much more expensive than its price.  It comes in a tlight blue plush bag (that is much bigger than necessary) inside a blue gift box, and it would make a nice gift."
4.0,Nice shirt but strings were low quality and shirt fit a little weird
4.0,The top part fits well. The issue I have is that the flowy bottom part has too much material to go around and it's very long.
4.0,"Classy and casual, sure, but I got two of these and hardly wore them. I think they require an undershirt, which I thought would be fine, but I didn't want to bother with it since I figure when it's hot enough to go sleeveless, it's too hot for layers. And they snag. I ended up donating these."
4.0,"They are comfortable to wear, but very difficult to put on."
4.0,"lovely, well made"
4.0,"I thought it was the sameone I order before, the first does not have pockets."
4.0,"This bracelet looked like it shoud be strudy, but the link to the bead looks as if it could break easily. Otherwise it looks great and rest of bracelet seems sturdy."
4.0,It's a nice dress but it was a little tight
4.0,"Love this dress! It is beautiful and classy and most importantly to me, it's crazy comfortable. I would recommend spanks or something fitted underneath if you have curves you are trying to smooth out. The fabric is very stretchy"
4.0,Nice look good quality.
4.0,"It is a nice dress.  Cost of dress is about right for this item. I did have to use some fabric adhesive on the seam. The inside part of the seam was hanging out past the bottom edge of the shirt. Easy fix. The flowers are not as pretty because they are flatten down during shipment and I can’t get them to unflatten. The part of the flower (appliqué) that hanges down towards the skirt is not actually secured to the skirt so my daughter kept picking it up to play with. It also gets stuck in things as she is playing. Would rather have seen it secured to the skirt. But overall still a beautiful dress. Fit was very lose on my daughter, but she is smaller than most kids her age so it was expected. Length was right on. She has size 3 waist but needs a size 4-5 length."
4.0,Ring is cute but does have a rough area that scratches finger.
4.0,My daughter is almost two and these were quite big. I would definitely suggest getting a smaller size. The socks are super cute! & perfect for fall!
4.0,This purse is a little heavier than I'd like. But the workmanship is awesome. I can't wait to use it. If I don't get compliments people are blind. lol.
4.0,Such a fun dress for spring and summer. Very comfortable and light
4.0,"I like the variety of socks included in this set, but the socks themselves are very thin (they don't seem like they'll last very long).  They're also short socks and could be better at staying up on your leg."
4.0,Very neat looking socks. Love them.
4.0,"The material is thicker and pockets are awesome. The v neck in front could be problematic if you wear to work and are bigger chested. It's longer on me but not overly (5'3"").  The white and multi colored bottom isn't as ""watercolor"" as I'd like but it's cute for $15"
4.0,"new fav slippers, they’re so cute and comfy!"
4.0,"Really well made, and has some weight to it. I needed the extra large and will order more in different sizes for other family members. Beautifully packaged too. The only thing is...is it real Jade? I question whether it is because it looks very much like Aventurine or Serpentine. Even though all Jades vary with respect to shade, the density of the color in this looks exactly like many pieces of Aventurine I own. For an additional price, and the beauty of it, it would have been nice to receive a certificate of authentication with it and an explanation of where it comes from and what type it is, ie, Jadeite or Nephrite."
4.0,I bought these leggings for the color and I’m usually a small (5’2 125 pounds) but risked it and got an xsmall. They are thinner then the other pair I bought and I would say not squat proof at all or maybe it’s just because I sized down.
4.0,A good gauntlet but a tad small.
4.0,"My feet have been cold my whole life. These really help and they are thin enough to wear another pair of socks over them, which I do. Still able to wear all my shoes without having to wear thick boot socks."
4.0,"I thought I could use these to hold my Aldi quarter on my keyring and well...you can't. Not on a keyring at least. To much movement and the quarter works loose everytime. Think I've tested a dollar's worth on that prior statement. Anywho, I do use it to hold my quarter but now it's an accent for my car's review mirror.<br />In summary, can it hold an Aldi quarter...yes under ideal conditions. Can it be a cool/cute lil birdie on your key ring so that you and your partner can be matching and maintain hold of said quarter...no...not at all. Still an amazing product though and I enjoy my purchase. Now our cars just match a lil thingy instead of our keys is all."
4.0,"After wearing daily for 7 months, I am suprised that it is still super cute and sturdy. The gold key has faded (pic attached), but thats to be expected bc it's not real gold."
4.0,Really cute and comfy dress. I was disappointed that the purple was more wine or burgundy than the grape shade displayed in the ad. But it's a nice casual dress for a low price.
4.0,I like the material the size and shape.  I like the pockets and separate compartments.  I love the over the shoulder strap.  It's sturdy a good width and the length is very adjustable.  It's had to find one like this. I only wish the strap clipped on and swiveled.  Then I would have given it five stars.  But overall I love this bag.
4.0,Size down fits a little large
4.0,"This is a nice lightweight mask and would be a 5 star if it were slightly bigger.  The problem I had with this was how it really crushed my nose, making it a little harder to breathe.  Other than that, it felt ok against my skin and breathing through my mouth was not a problem at all.  I also had a problem with always wanting to slide off my nose as I moved around.  This would be nice for a smaller person though.  Like I said, even on a hot day, it felt cool against my skin, much better than a normal mask."
4.0,"Loooove the pin, but the rubber back pieces suck!! I wish they had the old metal clippy style. Both of them popped off and got lost the first day. I replaced them with pencil erasers. If the back pieces were different, 5 stars"
4.0,These lovely gloves are too big and I had to return them.<br />Bummer.
4.0,Thought it might be a little tight from looking at the pictures of the product. I have a little gut but it still fits great. Great and easy for the price. If you're on the fence I would say go for it with this one. The low price and nice feel makes it worth it. The only thing cheaper would be to buy the materail and sew the two pieces of cloth together yourself.<br /><br />Would recommend
4.0,They were stretchy enough to fit the whole family.
4.0,Bodice is lined. Nice design. Only drawback is that the elastic on the sleeves is so tight it hurts.
4.0,"It fits my body type. The only area I struggled with was the forearms' sleeves. They are really tight. I'm not super lean, but I'm not beefy either. I wear these with tights and flats."
4.0,Nice trinket for a stocking stuffer!
4.0,Much nicer than the old-fashion string glasses holder. My older brother “bummed” a pair off of me for his use.
4.0,"I debated between rating these 3 or 4 stars. For the money, I give them 4 stars. PROS: I love the the look of the ombre (I got grey to white); it's flattering and somewhat unique / I love the high waist; it's super comfortable, stays put and is flattering / they're easy to hand wash and they air/hang dry quickly CONS: the fabric is not as stretchy as it needs to be to retain its shape and to move with you; it bags at the knees after just casual wear and the fabric struggles to move into deep yoga / dance poses like splits. I'm somewhat concerned that a seam might open or the fabric might rip during intense stretching. I think these are very good for casual wear or exercise that doesn't involve deep stretching."
4.0,honestly feels just like the apple bands and it’s a cute color.
4.0,"I normally wear a size 8 (and D cup) and I ordered a medium. The chest was tight, almost too tight to get the dress on and off. But the waist was perfect! The material is good quality. I am returning this dress because I liked another one just a little bit better. I could have dealt with the tight chest area but one dress had to go."
4.0,Great quality t-shirts. Soft and fit as expected.
4.0,"Nice change of pace with the smaller and larger squares. If you know how to solve the 3x3, then this one will also be easy. It worked well for about three months, but after awhile, it will start to fall apart."
4.0,"This costume was adorable on my 11 month old!! I was a little bummed that two of the snaps at the bottom were broken when I received it, but it really didn’t matter. The costume was big enough that no one could tell. Overall, I was pleased."
4.0,Works well. However it wasn’t clear that it did not come with a battery and requires a power bank. Otherwise a good purchase.
4.0,Super cute and all but it’s a little big bigger then I thought as a key chain .
4.0,"Great product, but size large for a medium"
4.0,Fits good although the neck part is pretty high and a little snug. Otherwise both the shirts we purchased in red and blue are very nice.
4.0,"Great skirt - loved the fit. I'm 5'4, 135 lbs and got a medium. This color was a bit different than the photo though. It's more of a white color than a tan."
4.0,I love this ja let but I just wish it had pockets. Also runs a tiny bit small.
4.0,Fits nicely but tends to ride up
4.0,I rarely give anything five stars. If it were possible this item would get four and a half stars!!<br /><br /> I have the first generation Apple Watch. 40 2MM sport addition. The different bands and watch face protectors are what give my watch “new life“ so to speak I can change the colors and designs to match my mood or just because<br /><br /> This item is fabulous! I got a beautiful high-quality pink and blue watch band and the matching pink/rose gold watch face protector looks beautiful. It also came with a clear one which is good to use with my other watch bands.<br /><br />I have used these items a few times now and they are still as clean and new looking as the day I got them the watch face protector is not chipping or scratched.<br /><br /> The rose gold color almost looks as if I bought the Rosegold watch face! I’ve had a few people ask me if it is the Rosegold watch. But I like sharing my secret with them. So they too can get a rose gold watch face for a fraction of the cost.<br /><br /> I change the watch face wallpaper and it looks as if I have the Nike sport watch with a blue and pink band.<br /><br />I will definitely buy more products from this company for my Apple Watch
4.0,Great size and convenient for shopping
4.0,Like it but is hi hdo a bit me room
4.0,purchased for y son
4.0,I get many compliments when wearing this dress. The garter around the arms get a little uncomfortable when I bring the sleeves up but don't notice it after a while.
4.0,I am 5’6 and this dress was long. I would have to wear 2-3 inch heels to keep  it off the ground. It seemed to be a good quality but I did return .
4.0,Super cute and flattering on. Very comfy and bra friendly. Fit true to size. Wear 8/10 and the M fits great. Love this dress will order in other colors.
4.0,Good style good size.
4.0,I was pleasantly surprised to fine how well made these sunglasses are...My five year old grandson immediately found them on my table when he came to visit and was wearing them all morning long...He was a super hero.
4.0,Nice purse for the price!
4.0,"It seems to be a sturdy, well made umbrella with a beautiful handle.  I would recommend it."
4.0,"I really liked the dress,material and color. However, I ordered a size Medium and it was too big on the sides. I'm a size 8 / 137 lbs. and usually order anywhere between a Medium or Large on dresses. I am returning for a Small and grabbing a few extra colors too. Perfect for the summer!"
4.0,Light weight but not to light. Very soft and great quality but not that stretchy! I loved it though just because its a perfect medium between light and warm weight.
4.0,Color and size
4.0,They're good for what I need them for.
4.0,"I bought this watch in May-2018 (oct-2018) High Quality product, just a little heavy, reason why I didn't give five stars. The watch have a nice design and it's very elegant"
4.0,"These socks are great for staying on the foot and for staying in place on the foot. I also like them because they are thicker than most socks, so they wont wear thru as easily as other songs will."
4.0,Works just like stated!
4.0,"Fabric was very nice, great color size runs small. Usually can wear xl -1x.  Ordered 2x and found it to be very snug. That was the only reason I returned it"
4.0,"good value for money, fit well to the face, light weight, good also for dry eyes relief"
4.0,Get a bigger. Ugh we size if you want a baggy look<br />The material is a little itchy<br />You must wash before using
4.0,The bar is way too long.
4.0,Nice product.  No complaints. Straps are silky.
4.0,These were cute tye die lounge outfit. It is very lightweight thin material. But I liked it. I put this on in the evening and where it to lounge in. It’s really comfortable.
4.0,It’s perfect for business casual!
4.0,Super cute. I'm 5'3 120. Ordered a large (usually a medium) after reading reviews. Perfect. More like jr sizing.
4.0,"The material is very soft and the fit is good except for the sleeves, which are way too long for me. That is why I gave it 4 stars overall. But the picture shows them bunched up on the forearms so I guess that is how I will wear it!"
4.0,a bit short
4.0,[[VIDEOID:4b21e52829763e8cbc345822a40ee139]] They are beautiful as u can see just piss that I didn’t get the exact amount I paid for
4.0,Cute shirt.. But runs small had to give away to my neice..
4.0,5'3 185lbs 36D ordered a XXL. Top kept rolling up other than that for the price I'm happy
4.0,Okay for the price. The finish is kinda scratchy though
4.0,Runs a little on the smaller side if you are busty. So I’m not sure if the description “loose” really fits it. I do like the material though.
4.0,Very cute. As described. Fits my Pandora bracelet nicely.
4.0,"I'm no average size, generally I wear an extra small. I'm 5'2&#34; and 104lbs, so it is bound to be hit or miss always. This one was a miss on the size. Cute dress and the fabric seemed worth the price. My one complaint would be the front chest inside fabric pice (??) Which was oddly sewn in and didn't lay very well. Maybe because of the too large sizing problem I already had, but it did look weird.  Couldnt tell if it was supposed to be flat actoss or draped."
4.0,Needed it to hold my lower belly flat<br />So far it's doing great. People has notice a difference in me.<br />Thank you..
4.0,"Nice tank- lightweight.  Decent quality for my needs, just wearing for certain events.  Fitted and does fit a bit snugger in the waist, so size up if you want a looser fit."
4.0,This braclet was for my grandson. I loved what it said & How it looked. Only bad thing is it runs quite Small. Only thing bad about it. Make sure to get size before buying.
4.0,"Very pretty ring, I bought it to wear in a cartilage piercing, and honestly it's not a good choice for that specifically.  At least for me, the post is too short to get all the way through the cartilage and be able to clasp it shut on the other side, and it's honestly a little big for a cartilage piercing for my taste.  But it seems to be good quality, and for another application like a nose piercing or maybe eyebrow, it would work really well."
4.0,"Nice, well made beanie. Bought several of these for a group that were dressing up as the '7 Dwarfs', and they were perfect for that! Plus, stylish enough to wear again. Shipping is a little slow (ships from China) but arrived before the estimated time, so overall happy with the purchase."
4.0,"I bought a blue pair.  Quality is fine.  Wasn't sure what to expect about fit, but I'm a 32-33 inch waist and got the medium.  Fits good, gives enough coverage and I felt good wearing it.  I used to wear speedos but as I've gotten older I wanted something more substantial and this was a good choice."
4.0,super cute and received many compliments. a stylish way to cover your head in the winter
4.0,"Cute belt! Quality's there, I'd purchase again!"
4.0,"These are cute, but spiders have EIGHT legs."
4.0,"The long strap on my 4 year old invicta Russian diver broke so I needed a new one. Original straps are 80 bucks! This one from a third party was much much cheaper. It was easy to install but the rubber band is flimsier and not as thick as the original. The metal rivets are similar but not the same as original. Hard to notice just glancing, but easy to tell if you look hard. It will work for now but it is clearly not as high quality as the original."
4.0,I ordered these for my granddaughter’s first grade class. They worked great for field day
4.0,"I had gotten both the white and black colors as they complimented different outfits I had. The turtlenecks definitely will keep you warm and especially your neck. Where these do fall short for me is that it goes down below or near my hips, and I don't particularly like to tuck them in. Regarding the sleeves, I would wish they would cover my full arm well. For the sleeves it went an inch shorter before reaching my hand."
4.0,"okay - these shoes are freaking adorable. They fit just as expected and I got loads of compliments on them. The soles are rubber and seem pretty skid resistant. There's even sparkly sequins and threads throughout the peacock tail. so pretty. I docked a star for the massive blisters that I have across the pad of both feet. The insoles are made of what looks like a grass mat - anywho, these probably wouldn't have given me blisters had i not opted to wear them on a vigorous lunch time walk. Essentially - these are pretty shoes that are a fun addition to my wardrobe. I'll probably buy more shoes from this seller - but I'll remember that she shoes aren't made for walking."
4.0,Its a nice coat buttttttt surprisingly not too warm. It was 28 degrees here in brooklyn this morning and i was pretty cold wearing it. It is made out of thin and not very quality material. Otherwise it looks great and feels great.
4.0,"I am pleased in all aspects of the coat,  its a little tight, can be worn, I am on a weight loss program and that is great.  Will recommend it to all who are interested.  a beautiful jacket."
4.0,Nice shoe.Very stylish. My daughter love the way it looks
4.0,Only place we could find 350 power lenses.  Took a long time to come but worth the wait.
4.0,"Needed some reading glasses that wouldn't break the bank. For the price, these are hard to beat. Not the most fashionable - but I do like the minimal metal frames. Would have been nice if a slim traveling case were included - but once again, can't complain for the price point that these were offered. Not sure how durable they are - but they are scattered around the house for the occasional need that I have - so they aren't going to get abused or used heavily. So far, they fit my needs very well."
4.0,They smell like chemicals and they were shipped with potpourri in the box so they knew they stunk before they shipped these. Not sure why they smell so bad. They look cute and fit just a little tight.
4.0,Very comfortable. Fits just right.
4.0,"This is a nice looking bead that seems well made. Finish is good and the crystal color is true to the picture. Reduced by 1 star because this alone does not hold itself or other charms/beads in place. You need to have the silicon rings to put underneath to make it actually &#34;grab&#34; the bracelet and not move. Given that small caveat, a nice bead."
4.0,great look glasses but are too wide for my face
4.0,"I'm a size 6 and I got the medium. I'm 5'9 and 140lbs. If I were to order again I might go for a large for a looser fit. There's not a lot of room in the crotch. I love the color. 10 out of 10 from the front, my bum is holding its own from the back, but the side view is horrible!!! They're nice pants for work though and go with a lot of my tops. I'll just avoid looking sideways in mirrors when I wear them."
4.0,The smell was more like a medium so it didn’t fit & there is no wire to support breast.
4.0,"I bought this dress for a wedding. I was really pleased with how the dress fit since I took a chance ordering online. I am 5' 9&#34; and it came to just above the knee. I normally wear a 14 or 16 so I ordered an XL and it fit perfect, however I am not busty. My only concern was when looking closely at the skirt, there were streaks in the coloring on the chiffon portion of the skirt. Since the skirt was somewhat pleated, the streaks are not noticeable.<br /><br />When caring for the product make sure to use cold water because it will bleed! I also used the iron on a low setting to get the wrinkles out, which worked like a charm."
4.0,I was really surprise at it quality. It's soft and light weight. Great for summer wear.
4.0,"The sunglasses are exactly as pictured on Amazon and I am well satisfied with them.<br />I am not a petite person and prefer larger glasses, which is why I chose these. They are even larger than I had thought.  I am not complaining, however, since larger than expected is better than smaller, and I will definitely wear these."
4.0,Beautiful dress but definitely order a size up. I normally wear an xl but the dress ran small.b
4.0,"These heels are gorgeous! They have such a nice sparkle, which pictures just don’t do justice. I agree with another review in which she recommended sizing down. I DO have wide feet, ordered my size, 7, and wish I would’ve ordered 6.5. Also, I don’t wear heels often, so the heel was pretty tall for me, but they looked amazing on!"
4.0,"Seem like great quality.  I've only worn them once,  but so far so good.  They are not as compression as I hoped,  but still alright"
4.0,"These fit as expected. My son is 4 and wears a size 8 in shoes, without orthotics. I purchased a kid small & they’re great. I’ve bought these when he was in a smaller size, in white & gray and the texture was soft, moisture wicking, and held up fantastically in pulling down over his AFO’s repeatedly & washing. This time however, I purchased the navy blue ones & they are tight without as much stretchability at the top of the sock & there is very little moisture wicking, at least in comparison to his old ones. I’m not sure if it’s due to the darker dye or what, but it’s definitely weird. I’ll stick with white or gray from now on."
4.0,"Yep, someone put the tail on the wrong side. No biggie, just cut it off and put it on the other side.  Has a real zipper and quality seems good for the price.  If I zipped it up all the way, it is really tight on my neck.  But, at this price point I don't expect perfection.  I am happy with this purchase.  Excellent value."
4.0,Comfy and fit as expected.
4.0,Material is a little thinner but not see through by any means. It's super cute and comfortable!
4.0,"Run small and short.  Good for workout, though light and airy"
4.0,"It's a great hat overall and would buy it again. My main problem is that a little of the ""fur"" is coming out. It's not much but enough to where it can be kind of irritating. Kind of likr a shedding cat. Other than that, I like the hat"
4.0,"Got these leggings in a light grey color (Titanium Ash) in a size small. For reference, I am generally a size 28/29, these were tight fitting but comfortable at the same time. I'm that kind of person who likes their leggings to be tight fitting not loose because over time they loosen up. To get that ultimate scrunch butt effect, you have to scrunch up the leggings from your thighs towards your pelvis and then lift the band area to give it the full effect. If not, it won't accentuate anything. They are not see through and so far have not sweated through this grey color during my workouts. I would definitely try other colors!"
4.0,"Very comfortable, cool and flattering. I gave it only 4 stars because the arm holes are a little big."
4.0,I have many different designs by this brand and love them all. It lost a star because the drawstring broke off before the first use. Found out the drawstrings are set in two different pieces so I couldn’t fish back through
4.0,Super cute and the fit and length are nice. The material wrinkles easily which is hard to get out with it being pleated. But love that it has pockets!
4.0,"Overall it came pretty fast, great design. Fits nicely just wish it was a little thicker. I live in a state where it's snow"
4.0,thin ...
4.0,The bottom is somewhat see through
4.0,Fast delivery.Not bad overall. I ordered and received a small. I usually am 5-6. I thought the pants would be a little longer like it appears on the model. However  they are a little above my ankles. I have considered getting a medium but I can make the small work.
4.0,"This skirt is touted as being 26 inches long. I measured mine and it's 25 inches. I do like it, however ... good stretchy fit, and it poufed out nicely when steamed. It'll do the job I need it to do. Meanwhile, as I order more rockabilly dresses, I'll try again on finding a petticoat long enough to show past the skirt."
4.0,doesn't dangle like in the photos.  The two strands like to tangle together a lot. Otherwise it's good quality and very cute.
4.0,This bag is being used by a Female (my sister) and she Loves it.
4.0,"Ordered a medium.  I am 5’6”, 200 lbs, 36DD.  I normally order L/XL and medium fits fine, could have gotten a L for a more flowy bottom. The fabric is a soft, not quite a t-shirt material but not as hot as other synthetic blends.  It does have pockets but not big enough to hold my iPhone 7 Plus.  Overall it’s a cute print and will work well on my vacation"
4.0,"Quite funny but make sure to wash it before you wear it, it smells horrible"
4.0,Love that it contains lace-up ties (on the inner arm) that can be adjusted and tied to fit individual sizes. Contains a few too many rhinestones which takes from the beauty of the lace throughout the glove
4.0,"I love the look of this suit.  I just bought five suits and this is my favorite.  But it is confusing.  It does not come with the bottom although it is included in the picture.  Then, it is hard to find a bottom to match the color.  I eventually did but it took awhile.  If they want to sell as separates, they should at least offer a midnight blue bottom for sale."
4.0,"My order arrived three weeks sooner than predicted. It's nice & compact and seems to be ok quality, I'll update when I've had a chance to use it (could be a while as I live in the desert). I ordered white and wanted white for a specific project, but it is almost a tan color with dark trim. I'm very disappointed."
4.0,Everything was fine except I was hoping the strap to be thicker/wider then it is and not made out of the polyester like material but more of a fabric. Other than that it is good. Doesn't have the strap with the clasp that pinches the ends together like others so it won't fall apart.
4.0,It will come off in my sleep
4.0,Really cute and great quality! It fits perfect however based off the pictures I thought the bottom would be a little looser.
4.0,"LIKE:  (1) Smooth feel of fabric; (2) Not very see-through.<br />DISLIKE:  (1) Shapeless. I'm 5'5"" and 118 lbs. and size medium was the right size for me, but it didn't flatter me. I have a short torso.  (2) The ""white"" wasn't true white, but off-white.  See picture of against white computer paper.  (It isn't even the ""bright white"" computer paper.)"
4.0,My grandson liked these PJ's. that is enough for me.
4.0,Very soft sweat wicking is great and there’s no friction while running in these socks.
4.0,This is a good material but we didn't find the way of how to use it. My husband thinks that a piece is missing but I think that we need an explication of how to use it.
4.0,Took over a month to receive. But it did come in a nice box.
4.0,Like the style. Little big in the shoulder area. Otherwise fits well.
4.0,It's nice. We like it.<br /> fits as expected.<br />Doesn't ride up or down.
4.0,"All the accessories are good quality. The tattoos don’t go on well, we ended up using makeup to make the scar."
4.0,"Very pretty dress. I am 6'0 tall and the dress was long enough! I have a wider rib cage, so it was very snug trying to zip up, but did zip. Ultimately I returned it because strapless doesn't work well for me- I'm always messing with the top and pulling it up."
4.0,"I guess I'm just fat.<br /><br />Love the fabric and the colors are awesome. I have several other A-line skirts that do wonders in hiding my apple bottom.<br />But, this skirt just doesn't.<br /><br />Colors are vibrant! Just what I wanted!<br /><br />Never fear- I'm getting on the treadmill and will rock this in a few months!<br /><br />(Was it supposed to have pockets?)"
4.0,"It’s cute and feels pretty cheap (as expected), but the pendant is huge, basically the size of my palm. The chain length isn’t long enough for it to not look awkward and it doesn’t lay comfortably against the chest."
4.0,So far I like it. Have to give it time to see how it turns out
4.0,I am normally a medium but after reading reviews I ordered a small and it is perfect.  The color is as pictured and it is very comfortable.
4.0,"Sweatshirt looks just like the picture and is very comfortable material but runs small. I ordered an XL because I wanted it to be big and roomy. The XL fits like a Medium. Still comfortable but not roomy like I was hoping. If you are buying this to fit your actual size, size up 2 sizes."
4.0,Good fit and support. High enough for what I need. Feels warm. I wish I could put them in dryer.
4.0,"Fast shipping and excellent packaging. Strap Code stainless steel bracelets are a nice upgrade from the factory Seiko band. They really transform the look of your Seiko watch, or multiple watches in my case, from a nice looking watch to a truly great looking watch... Unfortunately, I had an issue with one of the end links on the bracelet I received. It appears that the machining tolerance was off by just a few thousandths on one of the end links. This caused the spring bar not to engage the spring bar hole in my watch case. A little hand fitting of the out of tolerance end link with a jewelers file was all that was needed to get the proper fit.  I noticed another reviewer had a similiar problem.  I do not recommend anyone try to alter or file their end links if they have a similiar problem unless they have experience doing so. You run the risk of taking to much metal off and/or damaging the end link making it unusable. I would contact Strapcode directly and ask for a replacement. Strapcode has excellent customer service."
4.0,"Very comfortable for my plantar fasciitis.  I avoid walking barefoot on the floor whenever possible thanks to these.  The lack of heel support means they don't hold securely if I'm barefoot, but they're fine with a pair of socks.  If they had heel supports, they'd be slightly harder to get on and off; I appreciate the design because I can slip into them in the middle of the night without difficulty."
4.0,These shoes are very cute but the sole is hard & somewhat slippery. My daughter loves them. I took the other reviewers advice & got a size larger. I am glad I did b/c they run small so get a size larger
4.0,These are very pretty earrings.  They look very expensive and wear very well. I would buy these again if I ever lose one.
4.0,"When home, I enjoy being comfortable and this caftan affords me that enjoyment while also providing some style. I have received many compliments."
4.0,Anyone purchasing this item should buy it a couple sizes smaller because of the elastic waist and the flair.
4.0,"Dries fast. Nice style. I alittle roomy, which I hope I can grow bigger into."
4.0,"Nice quality, seemed to fit more like a medium than a large."
4.0,"They appear to be of better quality than the thumb pads that shipped with the launch day ps4s. It will take about an hour+ of research and trial and error to disassemble and reassemble the controller to replace the thumb pads, but if you have plenty of time on your hands, it's worth the savings of buying a new controller."
4.0,Perfect as a swimsuit cover up. Fabric is T-shirt material and if you are taller or high waisted the waist line will be high.
4.0,It is a beautiful dress.  It fits small with no allowance for adjustment.  Buy one size larger.
4.0,"Overall the dress is beautiful... I got Large I'm 5'6 190lbs.. wish I would have purchased an xlarge! Overall it's a beautiful and comfy dress.. received lots of compliments! Loved it, I would definitely get another one in a larger size!"
4.0,Very comfortable for casual/beach wear.
4.0,Really cute. Took a star off because the sizing was correct is you go based on theirs not amazon size chart I’m 5’3” 155pd and 42in hips i ordered a medium and i got some booty on me. Had to snap bottoms to get in and snap back and i was set. The only thing because i die have a butt the bottom seam was loose which i was surprise so you should order down a size
4.0,"the earrings are way prettier than the pictures..they feel sturdy and good quality, but I couldn't give 5 stars because I'm not sure I like how they hang on my ear..I like that they look like safety pins and not just shaped like them, but it makes them not 'hang down' straight on my ears.  I probably should have taken a picture"
4.0,Gloves are the hardest things to put on a small child! These are lovely andmade my little girl feel so elegant. They are slightly big on my just-turned-4 yr old’s hands despite her long fingers. Bows are not sewed on well and will fall off.
4.0,"Solid piece, fits well."
4.0,"Material is great and blouse looks cute on! Pattern is just like the picture. My only concern is it's a bit too oversized. I normally where a medium, but I bought a small since it looked like a loose fitting blouse. I actually think an xs would have fit me a little better. Still pleased with my purchase though."
4.0,"The Outdoor Research Men's Radar Pocket Cap holds its shape nicely, and the bill can be folded so that the cap can be packed or carried in a back pocket without damage.  Construction is very good, and meets the high standards I would expect of any OR product.<br /><br />The hat only loses a star due to the fact that the fit is somewhat smaller than I would have expected.  If you may be close to between sizes, you should strongly consider ordering a size larger."
4.0,"So far so good! They came right on time, exactly what was advertised. The prints are fun and they look very warm. Already used them and my son kept them on! Only 4 stars because it’s only been a couple days."
4.0,"It looks like picture.. I tried it on but I haven’t wore it out! I weigh 170, 5’5 and got a large<br />Fits like it should !"
4.0,Very satisfactory! It did k for them to arrive-
4.0,"This product is great. The ears stay propped up without having to adjust them. Although, the hat itself is really hard to put on and has an odd shape to it. I'm not sure if I'm meant to flatten it out or tough it out, but either way It's very cute. I would buy it again."
4.0,"This arrived super fast (to the central coast of CA) I love it. Super cute. It does give me a headache of I wear for a few hours, usually I'll just switch it to the other side if I start to feel one coming on."
4.0,"I bought these glasses as spare sunglasses for when I go to the keys.. I don't want to lose my costa brands in the water. For $50 these are awesome! I bought them specifically because the reviews were stating they ran smaller like children size. I have a narrow face and they fit perfect, if not a little looser. They don't slide down my face when I tilt my head down and they are light weight. They seem almost as sturdy as my $250 pair of costa sunglasses. I ordered the polarized blue but would have probably preferred the ocean blue for look wise but there is no sun glare with these. I ordered them yesterday and received them today! I don't know if they shipped locally to me in FL or not but I was pleasantly surprised to receive them today! 5 stars for one day shipping, 4 stars because I wish the lenses were slightly larger but they are still a decently large lense. I'm just picky with my eyes and prefer very large lenses. Very happy with product! I think I will be very happy with these in the keys!"
4.0,Very happy with this ring!  Seems made well and is nice and shiny.  Great purchase!
4.0,"Nice fit and feels as expected. Good padding, great design!"
4.0,"I  like the colors.  They are fun.  The socks are light weight, which is fine in warmer weather. I would rate them 4.5 as the elastic around the tops are just a tad snug."
4.0,This minimalist wallet/card carrier is everything I was looking for. The product's description is accurate and I would recommend the card sleeve wallet to a friend.
4.0,This was a birthday gift. It was a hit! One thing that would have made it even better: pockets!
4.0,It’s really thin material and my son wears L TO XL and I bought XL and it fits him without being loose I wish I would of got an XXL.  But he loves it!!
4.0,"The little hand sanitizer holders are cute and I love how they came in different colors and patterns, however, the colors looked a bit faded and dirty. I was hoping for it to be as vibrant as what is illustrated in Amazon but it is not. They still serve the purpose I need them to, only wish the colors were more vibrant."
4.0,Good quality and really pulled together my Richard Simmons outfit for a Halloween Ultimate tourney!
4.0,Hold my shirts in great. Only thing i don't like is i feel them rubbing on my legs when i walk.
4.0,"its ok, just a hat when it comes to this one.  i guess i have to match it up with some of my clothes so i can apreceate it more."
4.0,"Very elegant and fashionable! I'm 5'3 and ~112 lbs, and if I let them sit right on my natural waist, the hem just barely skims the ground.  I do have to pay attention when I sit and cross my legs to make sure the split down the leg doesn't show my whole thigh, but it's easy to manage.  The only thing that knocks off a star is that I really need them to have pockets so that I have somewhere to hold my phone."
4.0,I really like the feel of these soft stretchy leggings. The color is a bit more muted of a mustard but I don't hate it just don't expect a super vibrant tone. I'm docking a star as the fabric has already began to pill. It could have been a knick from my dogs but I don't recall it and feel disappointed to have something brand new already pilling. All that aside I do give the manufacturer the benefit of the doubt and have enjoyed working out in these.
4.0,Love my rap around HD sunglasses. The quality is better than I expected. I've bought some before quality was terrible!!  What I like about amazon is there return policy. You can always return
4.0,Great looking shirt.  Very comfortable.
4.0,"UPDATE TO ADD:<br />After wearing for 2 weeks straight (through showers, sleeping, etc.) they have softened up quite a bit, feel less waxy, and seem to be holding up very well.  I'm upgrading from 3 stars to 4 because of this.<br /><br />the bracelets are pretty but the string is pretty stiff, i understand they are wax coated, but it almost feels like plastic to me.  I've only had them for a day, and maybe with a bit of wear they will soften up?  overall, my first impression is just average."
4.0,Very nice and classic look.
4.0,Fits nicely on my daughter
4.0,I loved my dress
4.0,The dress fits like the reviews mentioned. A little tight across the chest but the material is stretchy enough to be accommodating.  Loose through the lid section which is nice and forgiving. I ordered a size small. 5’2” 123lbs.
4.0,"Love love it. Got so many compliments. Wish I could have bought a bigger size. The material used isn’t too good. I would use it for 2-3 wears, it might rip soon. They should lower the price for fabric used."
4.0,Pretty and I wanted it because I have the matching swim suit.  Very over priced.
4.0,"Great looking sunglasses and people really check them out. These glasses are made for small/narrow faces though. I suggest checking out the size chart on their company web site before buying any of their sunglasses.<br />I love the classic, retro style. Quickly becoming my favorite sunglasses I have ever owned."
4.0,Love the jacket!  I ordered the xxl somthe sleeves wouldn’t be too tight. I choose the brown and it is NOT brown; it is a really nice dark eggplant color.  I’m keeping it because I like the color and will order the mocha.
4.0,"The quality isn’t great, but it’s a good black sweatshirt to have laying around"
4.0,Cute coverup for summer
4.0,"I like the jacket: fabric, fit, front kangaroo pocket. I gave 4 stars because the bottom band should have elastic for a better fit, but I fix it myself by putting wide elastic inside the band and...voila! Looks great!"
4.0,I've been using them for a week now and am absolutely in love with these shoes. They're perfect for the snowy days. Can't comment on the durability because haven't used them much but yes style wise I think they're a must in any fashionista's wardrobe.
4.0,Warm! Falls off the heel though
4.0,Overall great. Not meant for short people
4.0,"I bought these for myself, however I ended up giving them to my husband because I felt that they looked too masculine on me. I do have a small face, so that might be the issue. But they seem to be good, quality sunglasses."
4.0,"I wear these gloves at work. I work as a forklift operator in a frozen food warehouse where the freezer section is kept at -10°f. Like all gloves that are not heated they will not warm up your fingers/hands if they are already cold, and you continue to stay in cold environment. These are good for helping to maintain warmth. Plus it works well with the small buttons on the barcode reading gun we use. They wear well and I will buy again as these wear out."
4.0,"Nicely made and easy to adjust. I have large wrists, and find most bracelets are too small. This one is nice!  However, I think the beads are plastic."
4.0,"Nice light weight, pockets!  But runs small."
4.0,"My boyfriend had to make a few more holes in it, that's the only reason I'm giving it 4 stars. I don't have a small neck so I was surprised that I felt like it needed to be tighter. Other than that, it's perfect. Thank you!"
4.0,Very cute necklaces. Giving 4 star bc 1 out of all didn't light up.
4.0,The apron is light weight but provides the protection I was looking for. I did replace the tie so I could tie the apron in the front.
4.0,The print on this suit is so flattering. I'm in between sizes so I ordered both xl and L and they both fit great. The bottom part is high enough to camouflage the fupa lol I just wish it had more coverage on the cups but great for the price!
4.0,"Beautiful dress. Having a little trouble with the fit and have sent it back. Now having issues getting a hold of the seller and getting refund issues. I am hoping that this will be resolved and will be able to update my review to a glowing experience. Honestly, tell them how long you need the length in the front from the top of the bodice to the floor while wearing your shoes. This dress does not sit in the hallow so that measurement does not get the extra 5-6"" you will need and not look like a hobo with your dress too short in the font by 6"". Also, make sure that you measure your bust by going tight, not loose. The bodice of this gaps and you can see down the front as we did a loose measurement and that is NOT what you are going to want. That is my advice. Other than that, the dress actually arrived early, though I did pay for the expedited shipping. And the sequins, seed beads, and rhinestone embellishes are really beautiful and make this stand apart from the rest of the mermaid dresses offered on here, or any other site. This could be a really expensive dress with all the details in the body layered on top of the lace.<br />Update 8/20/20- seller did finally refund the money paid, less the $40.00 shipping. Cost $20 to send back., using PirateShip. Waiting a bit to reorder, wedding rescheduled for 2021 due to COVID. A lot can change in the next year. I'm sure with providing the actual length needed from the part where the dress rests on top of the bodice to the floor while wearing heels, the dress will be fine. Hallow to floor or your height doesn't do any good though so make sure to include that info when you order so you don't have a hobo style dress. I fully intend to order this again though. They are pretty communicative, I think there is a small delay due to a time zone difference. Overall good customer service."
4.0,"The fit was  as expected and the casual tropical style was exactly what I wanted. They were not as comfortable as I had hoped, but I look forward to wearing them to run errands, and when lounging at home."
4.0,"Great socks, good quality."
4.0,The band lasted about 9 months. I'm in healthcare and wash my hands a lot. I also made the mistake of putting essential oils on it. That could be why it disintegrated.
4.0,very nice exactly as it looks
4.0,Suaves y ligeros. Aunque el adorno de le cayó el primer día que los uso mi niño.😌
4.0,It is in good quality for the price. It fits well. It does longer than it shows in the picture.
4.0,"The material doesn't stretch hardly at all, i'm wide shouldered. I cut cold shoulders in it. I love it now that my shoulders fit comfortly."
4.0,"I love the design of this. Alice doesn't move up or down, so it is a bit unexpected for people to see and most are delighted when they understand what it is. I also love the little book near the back by the clasp.<br /><br />My only issue with this necklace (and the reason for 4 stars instead of 5) is that the chains are not individually linked. They are in groups of 5 or so which means they chain doesn't move as fluidly and often little sections will get stuck at odd angles - very unlike a chain. I don't know the reason for that (does it save money?), but I tend to find it frustrating the more I wear it."
4.0,Beautiful dressage fit true to size . I normally wear a 12 to 14 and ordered a large the fit was perfect.
4.0,"Tiara is super tight, gloves and stockings don't say on too well, the white torso part is kinda of sheer"
4.0,These are great shorts for exercise and yoga. I wear them to hot yoga because prefer longer shorts to traditional short yoga garb. They fit well and are thick so they are not see-through. They are a little shorter than pictured. They lay a couple inches above the knee on my 5'2 frame. Great deal for two pairs.
4.0,"Very pretty necklace, only thing I don't like is the chain, it could be longer, but the peace sign is pretty, and different."
4.0,after trying several this one was the best
4.0,"This is a super cute outfit for my little girl.<br />Do wash separately, the pink in the shirt may stain - ours did.<br />None the less it's a kids shirt and they are bound to get dirty/stained."
4.0,Cute with jeans.
4.0,Little bigger than I expected. But I love it very soft and supple. Looks like a very quality purse. It's going to be my regular purse from now on. Colors are definitely off. And it's longer than I thought or taller I guess for better word. I chose to get a makeup bag to put my smaller things in so I don't have to try and find them in the bottom of the first. But I do love the feel of it is very soft and supple. The side pocket is big enough for but it is a little too small for a Samsung Note 5. I do still keep it there but zip it as close to it as I can so it does not fall out I keep medications in the front zipper for easy access including my inhaler. It's turning out to be a quite wonderful purse
4.0,"Fits well and is very comfortable. A little warm, so perfect during early Spring/Fall."
4.0,"I’m 5’10, 34C, 140 lbs and ordered a medium.  The bra is a smidge short from the shoulders to the bottom of the elastic, but the fit is comfortable, with great coverage and support for high intensity work outs.  The tank is super soft and slinky, and feels airy and light when worn.  The removable bra pads are a little thick, but easy to replace with others.  My only real issue is the tank looks quite boxy from the front...I wish it was slightly tapered to give it more shape.  Overall, this is a good, basic work out top that will get plenty of use!"
4.0,"For the price, this is a perfect pool bag.  I docked one star because the rope ends are literally covered with clear tape to prevent fraying."
4.0,Love heel height and colors
4.0,"Ok, so I'm a 65 yr old that likes Assassin's Creed and have been playin the series for at least 10 yrs.  Size 11 fits my pinky finger and is just slightly loose.  A half size larger would have been perfect for my ring finger."
4.0,Fit good and made good
4.0,Loved saying! I  gave 3 pairs as gifts each of the young men laughed their butts off. Socks material is a little rough.
4.0,"This necklace is very pretty.  I’ve not worn it a lot yet and great  I bought it to wear every day, but am not sure it will hold up to that.  I really enjoy the look however.  For the price, it is a great buy."
4.0,"I received my new bag within 2 days. I usually stay with mostly black bags, but I ordered the Khaki color this time for change. I like this bag with classic looking and right size,  thought it shows a little darker brown than the online pictures. The leather is soft and  the bag weight is not heavy itself. I love the 3 layers section which can hold many stuff inside, not bulky even you fill everything in. The cloth interior is not silky smooth but seems durable. You can wear it cross-body with extra long strap.  Compare the price and quality of it, I am happy with it."
4.0,Great Case. Nice and sturdy.  Sleek too.
4.0,"I likes everything about this robe, but returned it because it would be too warm for the milder winters here in Texas.  If your house is climate controlled, and you keep the heat at 70 or above, this robe may be too warm for comfort. The fabric is attractive and very soft.  I'm 5'4"" about 125 lbs and a small fit great."
4.0,The dress May be Great for you.  customer service and feedback was awesome.
4.0,"This item was to finish off my Mad Hatter outfit. It worked well and looked great. The thread could have been wound a lttle tighter, it wanted to start unwinding. Other than that. Thumbs up!"
4.0,New son in law loves them
4.0,Light damage on top
4.0,Seems like a good purchase
4.0,"Still difficult to put on, but comfortable"
4.0,Beautiful and comfortable dress. I wore it for my pregnancy photo shoot at the beach.
4.0,Not sure unisex is what I'd use to describe the cut. It is sort of awkward on my husband but it works.
4.0,Like it but I have small wrists. A little too big for me
4.0,Like the gloves. Details like the tabs on fingers and other parts are great for the price. Use them every day.
4.0,"Comfy, love the pockets, great layered or alone."
4.0,For the price this was great
4.0,I really like the shirt. I was just expecting it to be tan not pink.
4.0,"Fit like a glove, super comfortable. Got lots of compliments on it. Sequin feature was great, very clever. Loved it."
4.0,"I bought this only because it said that it will go wuth box, but it didnt. It came with a bag."
4.0,"I like this pendant but I don't like the cord, it's kind of hard to use this this pendant, I used another long chain."
4.0,"Good looks and proper, stable fit even when worn over the course of an entire day. Sock material is of medium weight so provides a nice degree of padding in your shoes but maintains enough breathability to not feel constrictive or suffocating. The 'Blue Camo' pattern is confidently stylish without being over the top."
4.0,"Arrived safely, did not break and looked elegant."
4.0,Loved the price and value
4.0,"It’s nicely made , I bought the size appropriate for my child’s age and it was a little too small, I would just buy the next size up!"
4.0,"My 7 year old wore it for halloween, it was ok, the hair extensions were not easy to put in the hair."
4.0,Very expensive...Beautiful card though but got a generic envelope...not the one pictured in advertisement.
4.0,I do like these. they are soft and comfortable. I do wish they were a little thicker on the bottom. I had another brand that were a little thicker but they only came in one size and are slightly tight.
4.0,Pretty and comfy dress for a good price
4.0,Let’s face it I’m fat. I want something comfortable to lounge around in when I wasn’t at my best. This fit the bill. But I wouldn’t wear these out unless I had a very long shirt and lighter colored underwear.  Lol.  They are very comfortable but you can’t see through them. If I pull them up to high you will get camel toe. Make sure that they’re more mid-waist versus high on the waist.  I’m attaching my scary fat pictures with me wearing them though people have a good idea. I’m 5’6” and I were a 14 W so be prepared.  Of course when you’re a size 0 anything you were looks good including a burlap sack.
4.0,"This is my third OR Radar Pocket Cap. My first green one fit the best, but was lost in adventure on a bike tour to Bayfield. My tan one is a little snug, but works well running, hiking, etc...in windy conditions. My pewter one is great, but a little baggy on top. Gist of my story, they each fit a little different. They dry quickly, fold flat and fit nicely in a pocket, and wash/dry by hand easily. They're way more stylish and functional, than a lot of the running/hiking/outdoor fitness caps that are on the market. I would give five stars if fit was more consistent."
4.0,"Looks great. Very comfortable. I do recommend washing alone the first few time with added salt to set the dye, as it dose come out a lot."
4.0,"The color is more of a hard black white checkered color, not pale as shown in the pic ,but they fit well"
4.0,This necklace is so pretty & well made it fits just right & the price was perfect . We all like them
4.0,"I was pleasantly surprised by the bag. When it first arrived it seemed small and I was traveling the next day and needed a good sturdy bag for the airport. I've got to say the bag was super useful throughout my trip. It kept a pair of sunglasses, cell phone, big wallet, tissues, mini babywipe pack and my spouse's reading glasses plus our passports. I loved how there are several compartments and yet it isn't bulky at all. I was very impressed. My only complaint is the green thread that keeps on coming out of the outer zipper compartment. I keep on cutting it, but more thread keeps on appearing. Hence, I knocked off a star. One final note, the color of the bag differs from one purchase yo another so don't expect to get the same exact color as in the photos. This is expected since it is genuine leather!"
4.0,"Dress is pretty and appears to be well made. I ordered the 5-6, which fit my 5 year old perfectly and was true to size. She loves the dress and immediately tried it on and started spinning around in it. My only complaint is that it did not arrive with the bow that was supposed to be included. So even tho the dress is great,  I'm docking one star on my review due to the missing headpiece."
4.0,Muy bonito .solo el pantalón corto es grande
4.0,Super cute...sizing stated XL would fit 38DD...sadly it's too small
4.0,"Queda bien bonita, el estilo y color es exacto al mostrado. Estaré cambiando la blusa por tamaño de L por XL. La entrega cumplió con su tiempo estimado."
4.0,"Very pretty dress.  The v neck was cut a bit too low for me, so I had the shoulders taken up slightly.  Comfortable dress, has a lining so it isn’t sheer.  Really pretty on, and looked perfect for the wedding I attended.  I wear a 12 (165 lbs) and that’s the size that fit me.  I’m 5’ 3” and it came to my knees.  I’d recommend."
4.0,"These look nice and do the job. The build quality is ok, but they seem very cheap. I guess that is why they are priced so low. They are good for the money."
4.0,"Fast delivery.  Very pretty print.  Light weight.  Great for cooler spring evening events.  Wide enough to go over shoulders and use as a very light wrap.  So many fashionable ways to wear.  ONLY THING, I received one with a  hole in in, an oversight I'm sure; BUT NOT PROBLEM, seller refunded entire price & then left me keep scarf without returning.  EXCELLENT customer service, so I'm going to break out my needle & thread & sew it!  It's a very beautiful print.  Would definitely buy from this seller again."
4.0,"Extremelly lightweight. Keep them protected, as they are also a bit flimsy in the feather droplets. Otherwise adorable! Love em."
4.0,These are great! The tip of the thumb comes off if you need it and there is a spot on the forefinger that lets you use touch screens. They are thin but warm. Makes a huge difference when running in freezing - below freezing weather.
4.0,Cute as can be.  The hard part is getting it on and off.  Very stiff.  I needed to use a pair of needle nose pliers.
4.0,the spots in between my fingers irritated my fingers and caused redness and pain.
4.0,The fit and padding are very good. The leg lengths are very long though.
4.0,"I have big wrists and this fits with spare room. I like having the clasp. Im no longer worried that it will fall off while hiking, climbing, or running"
4.0,"This vented riding pants is really comfortable, and fresh for hot weather. The fit is not perfect but it’s ok, I’m 34 in regular pants and 52 in EU Size, I prefere lose legs, this pants result a little bit right, not that it could be uncomfortable but not perfect; in the waist it resulted a little bit big for me, but nothing a belt can’t fix. Overall I’m satisfied with this high quality product!"
4.0,"This bag has replaced my go-to purse.  Love the size of it because it is not bulky like other ones I own.  Yet, it holds everything I need - phone, small wallet, glasses in glasses case, masks, wipes, pens and pad, etc.  And it holds them in different compartments which keep them ordered and easy to get to - ESPECIALLY the 3 on the outside.<br />Saves time at cashiers or producing insurance cards at doctors, for example.  Love that I can wipe it clean from the world out there.  The quilted design is cute & attractive. The only thing I would change is the gold color of the zippers but that is a personal preference of mine which is always for silver."
4.0,"Nice, but took a while to receive."
4.0,Great looking shirt.  Very nice quality.  I bought a 2x and it ran a little smaller than expected.  3x would of been perfect
4.0,It’s ok. Doesn’t fit my odd shaped head too well but not many do. It is comfortable when I try it on even though I can’t wear it because it slips down.
4.0,they were larger than  i expected but they are quite cute!
4.0,My boyfriend is going to love it I got it for him for Christmas
4.0,"It fits fine, and is comfortable for riding.  Yes, the pad is big.  If you're a hard-core biker, you probably don't need one as big.  But if you're relatively new to the sport, and/or riding 20+ miles at a time, you will appreciate the extra padding."
4.0,Just a little bit big but otherwise extremely comfortable!
4.0,"I sometimes have difficulty finding a hat that fits, so I hesitated purchasing one on line. But I'm delighted with my Siggi straw hat. I like the narrow brim: it protects me from the sun but I can move around without it getting knocked off. I use it while gardening, walking on the beach and floating in the pool."
4.0,"Ordered XL, fits snug like a large normally fits me"
4.0,The pink and white striped skirt is super cute. It’s a thicker cotton and not see thru!  Has a normal elastic waistband and very comfortable. Much better material than the neon colors which are thin and see thru. I ordered the black skirt too and love it just as much as the pink one.  You can't go wrong at $9.00 !!!  See pics
4.0,Very pretty and flattering on my size 1 daughter.  Didn't look like anything out of the package but once on it was a real WOW for the price.  EXCEPT shorter in the front and that made it too short for her 5' 6&#34; height.  Really bummed.  Would like to return but they don't give me that option so buy carefully.
4.0,Works great for making essential oil sprays
4.0,"not shoes, sunglasses...."
4.0,"looks good, drys quickly, seems to be holding up well."
4.0,I’m 5’6 136# and I got a medium I believe. No tags. Wrinkled but super cute  Long in the back which this 40 year old mom of 3 appreciates. Sexy but not risqué.
4.0,"I got these because I love the blue camo color of these leggings and I really wanted to love them but they don't have as much stretch as I like. They seem to run a bit small. I usually get a XL in leggings and they fit great but these are just a bit too tight and don't seem to have a lot of stretch to them. As I continue to lose weight (down about 160lbs in 6 years), I will give them another shot because I do love the color and the lightweight of them. I love that they have pockets but haven't had the chance to see if the phone stays put due to the fact they are too small for me right now."
4.0,"Product fits fine, however it is more cheaply made than expected. The wires keeping the charm attached to the clips are loose and easily bend out of shape, making the overall piece go crooked and lopside constantly."
4.0,Slightly larger eye frame then I was hoping for my toddler but otherwise some of the best I have bought. Other brands have scratched on the frame too easy. We love these.
4.0,"I like the shoes but the price sucks, no way these things are worth $100. But they fit well and they're just what I wanted,"
4.0,"I ordered a size Medium, and it fits well but it is way too long. Both the top and bottoms are too long. The material is very soft and cozy though."
4.0,These are really cute leggings and very comfortable my only problem was that I ordered based off of the size chart since I know my measurements but the leggings are too big an XS would have fit much better.
4.0,"Used it for baby shower party, fit real nice especially with a belly."
4.0,I ordered the gray large shirt. I am 57 and above average weight with 38 C bust. The shirt actually ran a bit large on me. Going to exchange for a medium.
4.0,Purchase this dress in February and took about three weeks to arrive. Not bad since I didn't need it for 6 weeks. It was a great price and I was surprisingly impressed with the quality of this dress. The embellishment on the dress was beautiful. The sequence was good quality and sewing was very well done. It fit my daughter almost perfectly. I purchased a size 0 and all I needed to do has have it hemmed. Very true to size. I will definitely be ordering her next dress from Amazon.
4.0,I purchased this product and it looks exactly as the photo listed.
4.0,"Excellent..., met all my expectations ..., site pics accurately portrayed physical product..., love my cap - would reorder and recommend."
4.0,"For the price, it's a steal. It does it's job and feels good on the head. Only complaint is the design, but nobody really sees it under a helmet."
4.0,"These are cute, but smaller then I had hoped. Tiger eye was very dark and not to spectacular, the other 2 were good.  Wire is cute but one is a little lose so I hope it doesn't pop out.  The cord necklace is ok, but I didn't buy it for that.<br /> I received this product at a discount for my honest review that is my own feeling on this product and may or may-not be the same as yours. I will only leave an honest review no matter if I receive a discount or not. I will update my reviews to add or subtract stars if the product changes during use.  The way that I review varies with each item.  Some have so many great things that it is easy to go on and on about all of the positive things.  Others only have enough to state that they are bad.  If a review is too long people stop reading it so what is the point.  My Stars also depend on how I I like/dislike the product on my own personal level. I may also list a product as 3 stars even though I didn't like it as it may be a good product in itself for someone else.  Just because it didn't work exactly the way I wanted it to doesn't mean that it is a bad product all around.  I hope that makes sense.  I also may list something as a 5 star only to come back after a a time to update how the product is and lower the stars.  Some products seem great at first and then the more you use it the less they work, break or just all around didn't perform to my satisfaction. If my review helped you make your decision I am glad to have helped.  You can click on the yes it was helpful button but in no way am I saying that you have to.  I don't do that often myself unless I feel they really helped. Make sure to ask questions if you have any to people who have make reviews !  If they respond and answer your questions then that is a review that is from someone that cares and I will answer any question that comes my way."
4.0,Wish the material was a bit thicker
4.0,was a good fit
4.0,"I am surprised most people find it runs small. I am a 34DDD and the size chart says to order an XL. I have a large and it ""fits"" but offers no support. Medium is still damn comfortable and I can run down the stairs, need I say more."
4.0,"I am normally a medium/large and sized up to an xl for this.. It first pretty well. Probably could have went smaller but didn't want too tight. Cute cut, just the top is littler higher cut then the photo. Will definitely buy more by them."
4.0,"The color had a more rose tone to it and is not as shiny metallic as the photo. Soft, stretchy and comfortable. Unfortunately I got the wrong size but it’s very affordable and if I need more I’d order again."
4.0,Sizes are way off. But i still love it and cant wait to put my daughter in it 💜
4.0,Lindo pero un poco pequeño
4.0,Very good statement piece. Just a bit heavy. Reasonable price.
4.0,"Ok ladies about this dress. I read the reviews before ordering and took a chance. Im glad i did. First the material is not a cheap cotton it has some weight and thickness to it. It almost felt like velvet on the underside. Its to the point i was worried that it may be too hot to wear during summer months!<br />Now for the fit:<br />I ordered 4x and i got them in all four colors. All the colors are true to what is posted.( a special note there are similar styles from other sellers i highly recommend buying the &#34;VIISHOW&#34; version because of quality and speed of delivery. )<br />Continuing:<br />I ordred the 4x because my &#34; girls&#34; are between 46-48DDD or 44-46 G and i have big arms that i like to hide. HOWEVER , im losing a lot of weight and im not the same size anymore. And i was concerned about fit. Im top heavy and a good majority of hips are gone. So my concerns were bust, stomach and hips and if would need shape wear.<br />The bust:<br />They fit nicely in dress. But if you dont like showing them off or your uncomfortable with them being out then i would not recommend this dress! Because they say hello world we are here, period!. If you have hips and girls and not a severe tummy then get the dress, you will turn heads.<br />Depending on your body type the fall of the dress will be different. If you have big wide hips thr hem of dress will fall shorter. If yor hips are smaller and more leaner, elongated it will fall longer on you. Also you have to consider height. Im just about 5' with medium to long hips dress fell just below my knees with split falling directly in front. ( i'll post pictures soon).<br />Cons:<br />Yes there are some cons.😭<br />Now it may just be me, but it seemed the white verdion was not sewn well. It may just be the one i have. But it just didnt &#34;fall&#34; right like the others. As for the red one, when trying it on, the stitching felt very &#34;prominent&#34;  in the back and the construction didnt look as good as the rest.<br />Overall:<br />Its a cute dress for the price. Even with minor flaws i dont regret my purchase. You cwn dress this dress up or down depending on your style. Hope this help, if it does please let me know."
4.0,"I love this bag!  I only gave 4 stars because I am short (5'2) and I can't adjust the strap as much as I'd like.  None the less, this is my travel purse on vacation and for work.  I go to DC a lot and keep my metro card in the strap zipper pocket. I have been know to carry shoes, light jacket, as well as wallet, etc. in this bag.  I love the mesh outside pocket for a water bottle or small umbrella."
4.0,"Hello!  This item in rose gold came quickly and was easy to attach to my Fit Bit piece like other replacement bands I've had similar.  I will note that the magnetic clasp part doesn't seem quite as ""tight"" as it was with a previous/similar one, and a small piece of the metal (chain if you will) did almost fray out so it was catching on things and hurt once or twice. It was enough that I put it in my drawer and I'll likely only wear it if my outfit requires that I keep my Fitbit rose gold. I went back to the more plastic replacement strap instead. Not bad for the price, but not great quality either."
4.0,"Just as described. Seems well made, fits as expected. Warm. Cute. Always important to be cute as well as toasty."
4.0,Really cute watch at a bargain price.  I had no issues adjusting band to fit my wrist.  I used a very small flat head screwdriver.
4.0,Super cute dress but also very thin.
4.0,A bitt simple but then again I still don't know myself why I got this. The product just isn't what I was looking for which was an elegant key chain. It's a bit too short for my liking yet I'll give it 4 stars because it is what it is. The bad choosing was on my part not the product since the quality is nice.
4.0,The constellation necklace I ordered from them was perfect. The quality was high and the length was adjustable too. Thanks for making this holiday special.
4.0,Good so far... look great and strong.
4.0,"I am about 5'4, around 150lbs. Ordered a Medium. Fits perfectly! Beautiful and comfortable. I absolutely love it, and that's why I gave it 4 stars. However, I almost gave it 3 stars because after only 2 washes (cold. Dried on low heat) the color is already fading. The black isn't as crisp anymore :( Maybe avoiding the dryer will help. In either case I'm ordering more because the dress is fabulous. Hopefully I can avoid color fading in the future!"
4.0,"I like that you get so many bright colors.  I use these with black strapping to organize lots of things.  There's (30) buckles.  Two in each color.  They are thick plastic and clasp easily together.  The quick release is just that, quick and easy.  I used 1"" strapping with these.  It was easy to insert the strapping and sew down the ends.  You have to make them to the exact size you need because they are NOT adjustable.  I really thought I was getting adjustable.  So, I was a little disappointed.  I will still end up using them.  It just makes it a little harder."
4.0,Pretty sweater<br />Runs a bit small.
4.0,"Very very thin, but quite comfy 💖."
4.0,"Very pretty top, swings nicely. The XXL that I ordered is tight across the bust, and I'm concerned that it will shrink so am returning it.  I am a size 18-20 and usually order a 2X in tops.<br /><br />Very easy return policy and no charge to send back."
4.0,"La calidad es buena, la tela es suave, el logo correctamente impreso, pero no es tan holgada como se ve en la foto. La tela es alicrada y se ciñe al cuerpo."
4.0,Great color and well made :)
4.0,"I’m a medium or a large, but needed a small in this dress. The seller has been SUPER helpful with exchanging the size. They are out of size small but they did a really good job of making me happy. Def would order from them again but in regards to this dress, size down"
4.0,"These are fun socks that work well with birekenstocks in the autumn weather. They do run a wee bit small and when I bought another pair, I upsized."
4.0,"I am pleased with the bag. I just got it, my only critisizm is the crossbody strap is brown. Would have been classier if it matched the color of the bag which is navy. Great size not small but not too big...perfect in my opinion. Packaged well. Absolutely no oder to it."
4.0,"What I like about the pouch is the rolling paper holder, but I found the pouch to be a little small if you want it to hold tobacco, filters and a Bic lighter for I like having all these with the pouch. For the price it is a good pouch."
4.0,"The heart itself is bigger than expected, but cute."
4.0,"I had my doubts when I first opened this necklace. It wasn't so much that it was bright and funky, because the pictures had made this pretty clear, but when I looked very closely the turquoise beads were obviously plastic, and some of them had chipped corners. Then I heard my mother's voice in my head, echoing what she always said when I, a naturally persnickety person, obsessed about some small defect in something I was planning to wear: ""If they look close enough to notice THAT, then slap them.""  Good advice here, because when I stopped looking at the tiny beads and put the necklace on, it looked great.  It looks especially good worn over a black dress or top, and it would work well over white in summer, or other complimentary colors all year long. I'm always happy to find a fun and easy way to dress up an outfit, and this necklace really delivers."
4.0,Glasses are stylish and comfortable.  Delivery was prompt.  I am giving it a 4 star rating because the top of the lens has magnification which I do not need.
4.0,Better quality than expected for price point.
4.0,Nice but starting to fade
4.0,Just received this today. Looks good.
4.0,"This was a gift, they loved it! No problems came with a nice gift bag"
4.0,Very pretty but very small.  The stone is the true larimar blue.
4.0,"Very cute and stylish dress. However it runs large so you might want to order down a size. It wouldn’t stay on my daughter’s (who is on the smaller side to begin with) shoulder so I had to pin it in the back. She is also a bit short so the dress came down to her calf, but that is perfectly fine since she loved spinning in it. She loves it because there was no itch whatsoever and very soft satin. It is very wrinkly when it arrived so let it breath for a few days then low iron it. Also, you cannot wash it in the washer/dryer, only hand wash so we are going to wear it sparingly."
4.0,Love it perfect big and everything
4.0,They look good and work fine.
4.0,Larger than what I expected approx. 1/4 &#34; dia. and took a little getting use to for me. Otherwise I like them.
4.0,Great thick quality! Color is true to what is shown on picture
4.0,"It's an adorable sweater, but it runs very small. It's probably a ladies size 6-8, maybe even smaller."
4.0,"Fast shipping, husband loves it!"
4.0,"Order 2 sizes up, shirts also shrink!"
4.0,I am normally a size medium and unfortunately I went by the reviews here and ordered a size down fearing it would be too big. I should have ordered a size medium. If you have any bust at all the top will be very tight. If it comes back in stock I will get my correct size.<br /><br />The length was great - still above my knees and i'm 5'2&#34;. The skirt fit wonderfully and the waist elastic fit fine.
4.0,I wore this to a wedding rehearsal and it was great!  The dress has a slip below it so even though there is a side slit it doesn't come up too high.  It is soft material (not the most expensive-looking fabric) but I felt well dressed and got compliments.  I got black to wear multiple places!
4.0,Great for a small child.  Earrings are very tiny.
4.0,"Bought for a Bachelorette in pink. I sized up to a M (usually S in dresses), felt that this was appropriate since the dress is very stretchy, but the material is extremely thin - you can see dark colored seamless underwear very clearly. You'll also need pasties if you don't want anything to show through. Still waiting for a few more dresses to come in before deciding on whether or not to keep this one."
4.0,"I like these pants they are just too big for a 34 waist with a large, go medium."
4.0,"Nice fit, only thin is there was a sharp edge I had to file down where the metal is twisted."
4.0,"great fit, good material."
4.0,This was a cute costume which I bought for my teenage daughter. I<br />Had to sew thicker straps on because the straps were so thin one busted when I was checking out the costume. It fit her perfectly other than that and wasn't as skimpy as I worried it might be although I would preferred it cover more. Would have given it five stars if the strap had not broken.
4.0,same as I other duster.
4.0,Somewhat smaller than expected. I usually wear a small but glad I ordered a medium to be on the safe side because they shrunk significantly as well. It's still a great deal though.
4.0,Good quality. Good price. Like the color and seasonal pattern. Comfortable for long hours on my feet.
4.0,They are a little tight but the new leather might break-in like all leather shoes!<br />They look nice!
4.0,Nice variety and selection of bracelets. Nice for the young. Not the best quality but not bad. Granddaughter loves them so that's what's important.
4.0,"They are fine and do the work, but are not exceptional !"
4.0,"Sometimes, simple things are best.<br /><br />This tie clip has no decoration, isn't especially flashy, and has few moving parts.  Basically, it is the simplest version of a tie clip you can find.  And it works great.  The silver color is shiny but not too much so, the clasp is strong enough to keep a tie in place but not difficult to manually open, and because of its simplicity it can go with almost any look from very formal to pretty casual.<br /><br />I've had this tie clip for more than five years and it is still going strong.  I use it on at least a weekly, and sometimes daily, basis.  Not only does it successfully keep a tie from flopping about, but it also apparently adds an unexpected touch of class given the comments I have gotten from people about it.<br /><br />The only reason I took off one star is because of the size of this tie clip; it is a bit too short.  It is meant for the skinnier variety of ties that are more popular right now, and I mostly prefer thick, dominant looking ties.  So this clip either won't reach all the way across the tie (visually this doesn't look too odd, so I don't mind) or you have to place it a little higher than you normally would (which visually does look odd, so I never do it).<br /><br />Overall this is an excellent tie clip and I have gotten years of good service from it."
4.0,"The top fit perfectly, the pants were about 2 inches short. Question us, were these made in China?"
4.0,Nice assortment of colors. Great for a party or group outing
4.0,"Love the sweater, love Patty Boutik, but sizing is odd on this one. I have two other sweaters from this brand, and they are XS and S, they fit great. I’m 5’3”, 110 lbs, bust 30D, waist 25”. I got a small in this sweater first, but it was too snug. The large was perfect for me, especially since I live in MN, and will be wearing warm layers underneath. (Pictures show size small and size large, though they don’t look that different.)"
4.0,The socks are almost fabulous. The calves are too tight. So if you have no calves these are for you. Actually I can get them on but it's tough. They fit very well until my calf. I'm hoping get they will stretch out a bit.
4.0,"Great! Love it!  I bought it for my son, it is small and almost didn't fit him, and he is small boned.  As far as sizing it would be better for kids or women not men."
4.0,"Love the print of this suit, the top is a tiny bit small but you can just loosen the back. I wish the straps were thicker, heavy chested ladies aren’t much of a match for spaghetti straps. Overall pleasantly surprised with how well this suit fits and looks for the price point!"
4.0,I love the heart shape but they are too big for my face. Frames are flimsy.
4.0,"I love how comfortable they are, plus they do not fog up. The straps are easy to adjust and the ear plugs and nose plug was a pleasant surprise bonus."
4.0,"Earrings were small, like I wanted, but hard to secure when putting on. Difficult to close, and posts would sometimes bend.  Very cute though and I did keep them."
4.0,"I love  this suit! It fits perfect and for reference I’m 5’9, 165. In swimsuits I typically wear a large top 36C, and small bottoms. i was skeptical about getting a monokini because if that. After reading some of the reviews I looked over all of the seams to make sure there were no holes. -there were none. The zipper is a little hard to pull up and down.. some fabric attached would be helpful. The little cup things are shaped weird, they don’t totally Cover the breasts but it does give good firm coverage to keep you from showing everyone you’re cold..<br />over all I really love this swimsuit."
4.0,"Easy to use, the bad thing is a little bit heavy"
4.0,The watch face is much larger than I really care for but I wanted a digital women's watch. I also wanted an expansion band so I changed that after I received the watch. Functionality is excellent.
4.0,"I am 5'5&#34;, 140lbs, 36C...the large fit perfectly.  Nice, light material."
4.0,"I am 5’6, 130 lbs with a 27 inch waist....I bought a small, and it’s TIGHT around the chest and waist like going out on a Friday night tight, but almost too tight for work. I loved it so much I cut the tags off right away, but I almost wish I bought a medium. I might just buy a medium in a different color."
4.0,This is a very nicely made wallet for the price.  The only drawback is that it is quite thick.  It has a fold out piece for ID and additional cards which is handy but without this piece the thickness would be more to my liking.
4.0,A LITTLE SMALLER THEN I WOULD HAVE EXPECTED
4.0,It looks like real nicks necklace. It's beautiful but I don't like it's quality much. after couple month it started to break but I tried to save it as new so now looks good. Quality is not bad but if it was better I'd write 5.
4.0,"Ya get whatcha pay for but I still like them. Size small, thin, noisy but cute."
4.0,Nice quality sunglasses. Just too small for me so i had to return. If u have a smaller face go for it. I find raen to be very nice quality
4.0,Super cute! Love the colour. Only issue is they slip a little bit on my nose.
4.0,Good product well built will get years of use out of it. The shoulder strap was was wrapped up inside the bag and when I unrolled it I found mold on the leather of the strap. This is preventing me from rating it a 5.
4.0,"I'm a slim guy. This fit me pretty well, and my girlfriend convinced me to keep it, even though the brown buttons aren't my style. (Because it's not exactly my style, I docked it one star.) Overall happy, and worth the price, for sure."
4.0,The pants are fine. I like the cut and the feel. The only issue is that the thread used at the waist seam is significantly tighter than the waistband can stretch. I end up having to wiggle the pants up over my hips gently to get them on even though the material fits. I bought the medium; buying a second pair in large and hoping it solves the problem. 135 5'4 size 6 usually.
4.0,Works great for wife and grown daughters but need to try a larger size for myself.
4.0,I would definitely size down as they are a rather large fit. I'm usually a size 8 in women's and these fit like a 9 and the ankle room is too big other then that they are cute.
4.0,"I was really impressed with this dress, the size chart was really helpful, the material is nice quality, and I love the fit... will be ordering something more"
4.0,Good fit waste tends to roll a bit. Comfortable overall.
4.0,it work great for 3/4 of a year. I still use my timex that I had years.
4.0,Loved this color and material. Very comfortable. The only thing is the shorter end that has the slot on the hand broke.
4.0,"Although a bit larger than I thought the medium would be (kind of bulky around the midriff area when zipped), it is warm and very high quality sewing so I think it will last.  Ask me again in a couple of years and I will be better able to assess the most important factor with any product: how well it performs over time."
4.0,These are very cute but somewhat small and thin.
4.0,"I use this for singing,  so a wire to hold it away from the face would be helpful.  I was able to  put one in myself,  but not everyone has the ability to do this."
4.0,Nice hat it was just too small for me.
4.0,Great earrings they look real. l lost one earring not sure if I accidentally knocked it off or if the magnet fell off but they definitely good earrings
4.0,"These rings are super cute. They arrive in mint condition, and look as they do in the photo. However, it is worth noting that this product does not come with a ring box to store it in, so you must provide that yourself. All in all, this is a great product."
4.0,Fits too small<br />I like the jacket but no room.
4.0,Love these glasses! They fit well! Not tight not loose!
4.0,Look and finish was surprisingly good for a watch this price. As expected this is not an accurate watch.
4.0,this was v v comfortable and for pretty nice but it has these two weird pointless strings on it????? idk i’d still buy another one if i wanted to
4.0,"For a inexpensive embroidery dress, it's not bad. I got the dress knowing that it would need alterations, and was willing to turn it into just a skirt if the top didn't fit properly. The sash isn't the same color as the dress. I need to shorten the whole dress little so I am going to remove the sash entirely (see first photo) and sew on a thinner, matching one. The neckline is a little strange and loose. Maybe it's meant to go off the shoulders a little?"
4.0,"Very sturdy, my son loves them."
4.0,"I’ve reached that magical age (30) where I find that most things just don’t suit my taste anymore, and the cuts are hideous unless you’re a fitness model. Which I am not. I ordered this in white (gasp!) and size medium - because I followed the size chart.<br /><br />I love this shirt. Seriously. It’s so cute I can’t stand it. The sleeves roll up nice (and I’ll likely secure them with my sewing machine as this is a look I like on t-shirts). The round hem makes it very flattering as I don’t need to worry about it being pulled tight over my hips, and it hides the last bit of lower baby belly I’m working off.<br /><br />My one downside is that the shoulders are kind of big. I have a petite upper body and shoulders. I ordered this in a small to compare sizes, but I can say once I get the sizing perfect I am ordering this in every color and donating literally the rest of my T-shirts. It’s that perfect. I am going to be able to wear it through all seasons and dress it up with the right accessories."
4.0,easy to adjust.
4.0,"These glasses are adorable and my daughter loves them, but complains that they are not dark enough to actually block the sun."
4.0,pretty suit ...i would stick with the darker colors
4.0,"It's very cute I bought it because I'm going to a Keith urban concert it looked like it was very country to me it fits pretty good it's pretty see-through I bought another four dollar crop top to put under it thats white and it looks pretty great now the arms are a bit tight but all in all I love it so my outfit is going to be this shirt a teal necklace that goes past my chest ,teal bracelet, A teel belt buckle and high waisted Jean shorts oh it's going to be so perfect once the outfit comes together and I bought all that hear on Amazon oh and Its not to sexy I'm only 16 at a concert full of drunk Country men haveing a hell of a time I gave it 4 stars becuse it is a little see thue and a little tight on the arms"
4.0,I wanted to like these unfortunately there biggest flaw is the fabric. Panty liners and pads will not stay stuck to the fabric. Otherwise they fit mostly ok and I liked the colors.
4.0,It's a bit baggy but then I don't like tight fitting. It's a nice light weight top for summer
4.0,"PROS: I have to say that that I'm very happy with this purse in person. It's buttery soft to the touch, made of real leather, has a nice wide shoulder strap, and has a lot of well allocated storage spaces. All the zippers work, and the pocket on the bottom left has a magnetic closure. The size is just big enough for my needs, and it's very lightweight.<br /><br />CONS: It's very lightweight because it's so thin and is lacking in any kind of piping or anything to provide structure to help it keep it's shape when it's not stuffed. The leather is paper thin, and it makes me worried that I might rip through if I put anything as heavy as a water bottle in it. I don't expect it to last very long. My bag also has seriously messed up stitching on the strap that I can't fix, but I plan to keep it anyhow ( though I did take off one star for it ).<br /><br />There was also a free nail-trimmer in my package. It didn't work for me, but it was a nice gesture.<br /><br />All-in-all, I'd still say this was a good purse for the money ($19.99), but I don't expect it to last more than a season or so."
4.0,Overall good ring
4.0,"It arrived on time and makes a fashion statement, especially with matching earrings."
4.0,"Items looked just like the picture and description. The rose gold color coating started to wear off pretty fast, but overall a good deal for the price."
4.0,"This is a beautiful bag, just smaller than expected. I will use it on occasion but<br />Not as an everyday bag since it is small."
4.0,I love how cute this key cap is. I had my house key fall off my key ring somewhere and I lost it. When I got a new key cut it looked exactly like another key I had so I wanted to get something to tell the difference. This is super cute and nice quality. My only complaint is the little chain it comes with does not stay clasped when bumped around and it already fell off my keys within a few days. Luckily i didn't lose my key this time. Due to how thick the product is I had a heck of a time getting a normal key ring on it but I managed to do so. Hopefully it won't get lost now.
4.0,Great for summer fashion.
4.0,Love the style and feel. Well constructed. Says it is 100% genuine leather but doesn't look or smell like cow leather. Made in China.
4.0,Great fit and design is great too
4.0,"I'm pretty happy with it. I've never bought a chain for a wallet before, not saying I've never had a chain before but I've always just &#34;built&#34; my own to replace the junk that usually comes with the wallet. Seems a little pricey, BUT I couldn't find a silver hook anywhere, only brass and the chain itself is really really nice, a little long for my taste but that's better than too short right? I had to modify it to my personal specs but I'm picky. Had to put out a couple more bucks to make it just right but all in all it's pretty sweet. 4 stars now cause I just got it and can't speak for how long it'll last but it seems like it'll be changed to 5 later"
4.0,"I'm a size 16 and ordered an XXL, which fit perfectly."
4.0,They’re awesome sunglasses. My only small complaint is that one lense is somewhat loose and doesn’t feel durable. But overall I like them and I like how they come with a sticker and wristband.
4.0,Very pretty but falls out of your ears easily
4.0,Very nice- The color though is very bright. I prefer soft tones.
4.0,"This is a beautiful dress. I bought the royal blue and it's color was true to the picture. It's a nice material and actually kind of a heavy dress which I like. It's long and flowy and the waist is flattering. My only issue is that there is a ton of material at the chest which wasn't my style. My measurements are 34-30-39 and a Medium was perfect. I would have kept this dress as my bridesmaid dress, but I did find something better with a more flattering bodice."
4.0,Good quality plastic so expect plastic wear
4.0,Fits as expected only wish they had larger sizes or enough fabric to tailor
4.0,"I had high hopes for this necklace, despite it's price.  It is attractive, though the way it was put together some of the &#34;hardware&#34; behind the scenes shows.  On the necklace we received, on the right side, the layers are not as close in the picture and you can see the rings that hold it together through the gap.  That being said, the necklace is still attractive and my wife likes it.  For the price I am not terribly surprised, but it would be five stars without the visual appearance resulting from poor construction.<br /><br />One note, the &#34;leaves&#34; are not all individual, but are connected in rows.  It doesn't move as though they were all separate pieces, if that's something you're looking for."
4.0,Very satisfied with my belt good quility very strong material belt buckle very strong plastic love it fits well easy on easy off thank you.
4.0,Arrived broken but nothing super glue couldn't fix. Very cute and dangly. Wore them to my daughter's Bridal Shower that was themed 'On Cloud 9'
4.0,Nice material. Very cute. Love that it has pockets.
4.0,My husband loves them and runs all day in them. They are not breathable enough for me (I am prone to panic attacks if my air is cut off).
4.0,"These are true to size. I like how warm they are and they feel really comfortable, especially around my calves. They have wonderful traction too! The only thing I don't like is they look a little weird after wearing them a while - they scrunch up ever so slightly after walking for a bit. This isn't a huge deal, but for some it may not be as ""aesthetically"" pleasing. If that does not matter to you much, these are great boots!"
4.0,"the cloth is great and size small is accurate for size 4-6, breathable material..."
4.0,Its important for me to have a good hood closure . This one does the job
4.0,A little smaller than expected but meets the need.
4.0,"This dress runs a little large, but nothing a little bit of sewing cannot fix. It's cute and is pretty high quality especially for the price."
4.0,"thought these were 24&#34;,but nmeasure 22&#34; when arrived and still &#34;stuffed&#34;pillow into it,they look georgous on the brown leather couch"
4.0,I love this shirt.  Its a perfect fit
4.0,Fit is great and they are comfortable
4.0,"I really like these booties. The color is as expected and so is the style.  They fit just right, I normally wear an 8 and that is what I ordered."
4.0,"Item came on time. Color changed within less than 3 days of me wearing them. They were, earring were cute but won’t buy again."
4.0,So I gave this to my mother but I got it so late I was suppose to receive this with other items but it didn’t arrive and I got it late like December 20th but she does enjoy wearing it great gift but I suggest getting it by itself
4.0,I got a size too large the first time. Second pair fit perfectly. Really nice.
4.0,Good quality.  I didn't like it as much as I thought I would (for me).  Gave it to my Mom and she loves it.
4.0,These glasses are very nice. A little bigger than I thought but very nice.<br />I love the print and color! If you like purple and animal print these are for you!
4.0,Love the shirt it's comes in a big size so if you xl get a large
4.0,Product arrived as described. Shoelaces were packed in the biggest possible box (-1 star.) Wish seller packaged more conservatively. Product went right with my Jordan's. The length of the laces was just right.
4.0,"If your already familiar with C-Shock watches, then you know what your getting. If your not, then welcome to the club. C-Shocks are large (45-48mm) watches, with an array of functions. This one is nicely built, large and a great color scheme. My only knock in this version is that the illuminate feature is a bit lacking. Instead of and LED illumination., Casio went with an light to illuminate the face, which works fine lighting up the dial, but you can't see the LED functions at all. Overall this is a great sports watch, good for everyday use and style"
4.0,"I got this for my husband and I when he went on deployment so we can have a cute nerdy connection to think of each other while he is away. The only issue I have with this item is that it has permanent lifted bubbles on both pendants that are very obvious and annoying to me. It at least doesn’t effect the writing in any way, just wish it didn’t have the annoying bubbles. But for the price, I can’t really complain. If youre a Toy Story fan like myself, this is a good buy for a good price"
4.0,La tallla en algún momento del proceso cambio y no me percaté<br />Devolví el producto y me reintegraron<br />Muy buen servicio de devolución
4.0,"I love these socks.  Suggestion:  Find a way to make them not as thick, especially for folks in warmer climates like Florida."
4.0,"These are the only earrings my 2 year old has not lost! Stay on very well. Look a little darker with time, but has not made her ears green!"
4.0,"Works well, the padding was a bit thicker than I thought it would be.  Works out ok tho."
4.0,It looked more tapered in the picutre
4.0,Fits very well over my glasses
4.0,"light and comfortable.  bought this as a gift for my college student neice.  great, easy way to carry essentials without having to carry a purse/wallet."
4.0,This shirt is a vibrant hot pink.  It fits well though it runs a bit small so order a size up if you are busty.  I have washed it a couple of times but only in cold water and I line dry it.  The color has remained vibrant and the material is still soft.  Will order more in different colors.
4.0,"Wearing as liners, feet are warm and comfortable,no sweat either. I'd buy them again."
4.0,These are wonderful for keeping your eyes protected. They give an amber hue to everything and cover the whole eye so I don't have to tilt my head like I do with most glasses. My husband also used them and he always has to wear sun glasses and said he really liked them but the nose piece was to tough for him.
4.0,"Very beautifull watch and resistant, the pink part of the watch if delicated and my wife love it. It's a nice watch for casual visits. The only one problem that I see and not my wife, It must to be because she love so much this gift, well the only problem is that the wide part is very hard and no fit with the narrow amr of my wife, the wide part describe a circle and is not easy of deform this, maybe with the time and use... Sooo... the rest of this is beautifull and very sexy casual watch. Highly recommended."
4.0,fits as expected. Very cute dress but a little on the thin side
4.0,You’ll need a slip. It is lined but still a bit see through.<br />I’m 5 ft 4 and about 150ish lbs.
4.0,Glasses were fine but neck cord was cheap and broke on first day.
4.0,"This is a sturdy play crown that can stand up to some abuse. My daughter loved it to pieces( Literally) but she was not gentle. It took some destructive force and a few months before this crown broke. If you get it out for dress up and put it away after, this crown would probably last a lot longer. Great value."
4.0,"Beautiful, elegant necklace. Love the colors."
4.0,"Quality is great, but these Asian sizes are not. I have a large head, and it’s a little tight on the last button."
4.0,"at first connection seemed to be too loose, I guess it is ok now"
4.0,quality is ok but not great
4.0,"Fun, cheap glasses!"
4.0,Very nice.  Just received & nicer than most I purchased.
4.0,I like the shirt. It is sheer and oversized to hide mommy tummy. Nice bold floral design and it is lightweight material.  Pair a tank top with it and a pair of jeans you are all set. Hells or flats work nicely.
4.0,Great T. More flattering than I expected. Would like to order more but have not figured out how to do that without having to start all over again.
4.0,"I read in other comments before ordering that these are large glasses but didnt THINK THEY WOULD TURN OUT BEING THAT HUGE! They cover my eyesbrows and practically cover my cheekbones, if your looking for a fashion statement cali girl look then these are for you. definitely not an everyday pair of sunglasses but are a great price, great quality and do their job."
4.0,"Great product however, I do not like the fact that these ear pieces have a tendency of flipping around"
4.0,Should of gotten a smaller cup. But it works as best as i can get it too. Just takes time to get the right fit and cleavage desired.
4.0,A little bigger than I thought it would be but I'll still wear it
4.0,"I was sent the wrong size shirt by accident. It was far too big for me to wear! I will be returning it for a smaller size. It was cute, but just way too big! I love the feel of the knitted material. It does not feel cheap and is rather thick so it is not see through. You can dress it up or down with a pair of shorts or jeans. It looks very cute, stylish and comfortable. It looks especially flattering if you have a larger bust. If the size were smaller, it would definitely hug my chest to give me some shape."
4.0,I'm a 36B and the medium was WAY too small.  Just got the large as a replacement and it's too small too. I think what it is is the band on the bottom is super tight and restrictive. I even have a hard time getting it back off.
4.0,Great polorized lens! Sturdy frame and UV protection is just as good as my $250 Ray-Bans
4.0,"I just recently lost over 100 lbs and wanted something sporty sexy, this was perfect. I felt cute and sexy. 36DD and size 10/12 i bought the lg."
4.0,would have been nicer if there was elastic instead of ribbon ties.
4.0,"The sandals are comfortable but the second day that I wore them, lost one if the flowers"
4.0,It's a really soft and light fabric. It's perfect for the gym.
4.0,"I bought this for a Victorian styled gown, the hops were a tad wider then expected. It holds its shape with a heavy skirt placed over it and stays in place well once tied. It is fordable hoops so you can sit down without the hoops flying up if you arrange them slightly."
4.0,Shipped on time. Fits pretty good.
4.0,"I wear a size 13 shoe and these socks fit well. and seem to be pretty good quality.  Several washes so far and no problems. They could be a little taller.  This ""quarter"" size description used by sock suppliers has no consistency."
4.0,"This is a beautiful bracelet, but it was too large for my wrist. I wear a 6 1/2 and it could almost slip off my wrist.  I don't think it's a true 7&#34;.  It wears more like a 7 1/2&#34;.  Had to return it."
4.0,I recently purchased this for myself to have something warmer to wear to bed as its getting colder and I do not like to sleep in pajama pants. Its  not as soft as I was hoping to be but still is comfortable. If It holds up well after a couple washings I will most likely order a few more.
4.0,"My daughter loves them but they smell really strong like tires.  Kinda grosses me out, especially in the car"
4.0,Feels pretty solid for an aluminum keychain.
4.0,"The dress fit surprisingly well. It’s light and airy which is perfect for the summer. I got the size medium, which is my usual size. I’m 5’3”, 135lbs and it doesn’t feel too tight nor too loose and it hits above the knee. There is a stretch to it. I wouldn’t recommend this dress for tall women with a bigger chest, it’s a bit tight. This dress would be great for petite gals."
4.0,"Really a lot nicer quality then I thought it would be. I waited a long time for it, but it was worth the wait."
4.0,"I received my order quickly. However when I opened the bag I was missing the Tiger ear wrap. I contacted Amazon and they replied they could not control what the seller sent. They did, however, offer me a partial refund and an apology. I am happy with Amazon's commitment to their customers. Bundle Monster should be more careful to include all items as stated. Sadly I really liked the missing piece. The rest of the earrings were nice looking and I have worn several already. The quality is good for the price."
4.0,"I received this package of ""men's underwear and gave the set to hubby.  He later saw them on the dress and said.....  these must be yours!  I said,  ""no.... they are men's""!  He replied,  ""NO,  they have no opening""!<br /><br />Well there it is,  hubby will not wear them without an opening.  So,  I wear them.  I like the length of the leg,  and the waistband is nice and tight!  The fabric is quality.  They are comfortable to wear and good enough for a woman."
4.0,Is nice size soft leather bag.
4.0,"This jacket is just enough on cool evenings.  It's comfortable, fits well altho I ordered a large and medium would have fit.  The pocket flaps are different than in the pic but I like it just as well."
4.0,Nice socks that fit very nicely.  The characters seem a bit off.  Good price.
4.0,"Used this on the beach in Haiti and really was cute! They did turn tarnished color later on, but that’s expected since I wore them in salt water."
4.0,The quality on this little jacket is superb for such a cheap price! The fit was perfect and looked adorable. The material was comfortable and warm. Perfect for in between weathers and autumn.
4.0,Attractive case snaps on the outside of my tennis bag.
4.0,It’s comfortable but the pattern looks faded
4.0,Another near miss. This fabric is so  thin. Didn't realize the zipper was the entire length of the back. Makes it easy to get in to. Sporty more than work casual.
4.0,Birthday gift for my son. He loves it!!
4.0,Love the light feel of the fabric.
4.0,I was able to purchase this item at a reduced price for my honest review/opinion. my review is not altered by the vendor and it's  my honest view/opinion<br />first let's  start off with the<br />PROS:<br />easy fit (true to size)<br />simple dress but with the right accessories it's  even more appealing<br />shows  curve as well as enhancing them<br />it can easily  be  a day to night dress<br />(blazer over dress to pull off the day look)<br />CONS:<br />the material was a little thick<br />garment is easy to wrinkle<br />overall I liked  the dress and I liked the fact  of being able to turn it into a day/night  outfit is a plus
4.0,"This skirt has a great fit and vintage vibe, very versatile."
4.0,"My husband is 5'9 so the shirt is a little long for him, but he is just fine with that!  However he is an extra large and around the stomach it fits great! He loves it, not that he bowls, but because he is a big fan of Charlie Sheen in &#34;2.5 men&#34; and loves to see Charlie wear his bowling type shirts.  That's my hubby and that's why I love him so!  But I washed it and this is a shirt you have to iron! What can I tell ya......  Mrs. Judie St. Augustine, Fl."
4.0,Nice fit and cozy
4.0,"Ordered 2. One worked,  one stopped the first day I used it. However they are sending a new one right away and were very quick to respond."
4.0,I love it!!!  Light weight but amazingly warm!!!  I got it to wear with jeans!!  But...it has no pockets
4.0,I really like the dress. It fits true to size for me. I wear a large and it fit good.
4.0,"Nice looking bag, exactly as on the picture"
4.0,"Needed a watch i could wear more often than my good watches. And this helps its Definitely a good buy easy instructions, water resistant, good quality. Over all can't complain."
4.0,"My son loves this set, wears during every game!"
4.0,"we ordered this for a wedding my husband was in-, but someone found the box it came in and threw it away before he could use it.  The color was good as was the fabric.  Pretty bummed it's in the landfill somewhe​re. Wish he could have got some use out of it!"
4.0,"So, to be clear, I LOVE this top.  I am 5'6"", 155 pounds, 34DD, and I bought the medium.  It is a tad snug across the tummy, but my compression exercise leggings take care of that.  The thing that SHOCKED me was, there was still room in the bust area.  Seriously, almost zero support if I am jumping up and down (even with a shelf bra and sturdy built in cups).  That being said, I bought it for yoga, and because it has a higher neckline the girls don't show too much if I am stretching all over.<br />My item was more purple/grey/black streaks than the photo.  The stock photo looked more purple/pink to me, at least on my computer.  Length in the waist is good.  The back is adorable.  I will wear this every week (but maybe with an extra sports bra underneath).  Cheers!"
4.0,Much better than the metal buckle version
4.0,"Review said ran large but I didn't expect it to be so large , even with thick socks.  Ordered small size , will be returning med pair."
4.0,Top kinda small ..seems more revealing than picture
4.0,was much heavier than expected
4.0,"Pretty dress, but the sleeves are too tight. I read the reviews mentioning this problem and ordered a larger size to avoid a problem. They were still too tight. I may try to have them altered."
4.0,Seems good for a short term fix. Arrived in a timely manner. No complaints.
4.0,Dress fits perfectly. Very comfortable.  The color is not pink but coral.
4.0,Pretty but the stones are very small so hard to see
4.0,People always ask if they are real glasses. Unfortunately I already lost them.
4.0,"I got this as a gift for my Dad and he loves it. It's not too big or too small. He wears it almost everyday. I was concerned for the price it would look real cheap, but it doesn't. The quality is about the same mid-level quality you would find at a western outfitter store. I plan to purchase more of these for my Dad and myself."
4.0,"This vest was much thicker than the photos and so not as flexible, and much smaller than I expected."
4.0,"I bought this hat to have something to wear in the summer time, to shade my eyes and keep my sweat from running into my eyes. The hat fit perfectly and I like the color. Also the hat appears to be good quality materials and stitching for the price point. I went to a sporting goods store to buy a bucket hat and they were charging $30.00. The only negative things about this hat in the brim is somewhat wider than anticipated (I probably did not examine it very well) and the wind guard which I will probably cut off. Dorfman Pacific is a good name in hats and are well known for their quality."
4.0,Quality is excellent but I would rather have orange tie strings for the flaps instead of Velcro. The Velcro in my opinion won't last as long and will attach itself to other material when the flaps are down and also will plug up after time.
4.0,"This skirt is awesome! It is so comfortable and looks amazing! The elastic waist is true to size and the lining is perfect. My one note is that the size of the holes in the overlay are just the right size to get caught on EVERYTHING, so be careful."
4.0,"These pants are okay. They are definitely a cotton blend, heavy on the cotton. They are stretchy and very comfortable, but they definitely show sweat. Even the black ones show sweat. Otherwise, the fit and feel are great."
4.0,"Love this dress however it's not how I expected it to fit. I'm a 38DD and a size 13 in junior bottoms, usually I buy a size up due to my bust size but a lot of reviews says order your size. I order a large it's somewhat small at my bust. But love the dress follow your measurement on their chart. Exactly like picture! Great quality."
4.0,My daughter loves it but the only complaint is the skull is very tiny you can barley see it. She love it so that all that counts
4.0,I love this bathing suit! But I'm a 2x and I ordered a 3x and it fit really snug. Other then that I get compliments all the time!
4.0,"My friend told me about this brand so I gave them a try. Love the feel and look. I am a size large, but they are a tad big on me. I will just order medium next time! I'm keeping these and will use them for yoga!!"
4.0,Like the gems but hard to open
4.0,"So it’s great material, only reason it was a little big on me (I ordered a small) is because I’m just SO tiny. I’m 4”10 and 115lbs. But honestly it’s still wearable and I love that the neck strings can be crossed around your neck like the picture but also can just be tied straight too. Really pretty dress!"
4.0,"These definately run small!  First ordered a small, then ordered a medium and it worked much better.  I would suggest ordering up at least 1 size.<br />However, now that we have found the right size, my husband really likes them."
4.0,It is exactly how it looks.  I'm using this for Venus in Fur and it is adequate for a stage fur shawl.
4.0,They are perfect. Some of the best no show socks ever.
4.0,It dries super fast after wet!
4.0,"Comfortable material  , great in length .. fit as expected ."
4.0,"These arrived as the Camo Grey pattern, rather than the expected American Flag pattern, but still look pretty good. As promised, the mostly-cotton fabric is smooth and comfortable underfoot.<br /><br />As for size, the length (XL) is just right for my size 10 foot, but the top of the sock is tighter than usual and expected, likely due to the high elastic (10%) and Spandex (14%) content. It wasn't uncomfortably tight, but did leave an imprint on my calves after a few hours. Anyone who needs or likes diabetic socks won't want these. (My wife reminds me my legs are wider than usual because I bicycle a lot and also lift weights regularly.)<br /><br />Update 8/28/19: Sadly, these shrunk quite a bit when washed normally. They still easily stretch out enough to fit my foot, and remain comfortable, but if I were buying again, I'd order the next size up."
4.0,"Saw previous reviews stating to go a size up. I can wear anything from an XS to a Med. this I decided to get in a medium and I'm very happy with my choice. I am a 32DDD/34DD, waist is 27-30 inches depending on the day. And it fits perfectly. The sleeves are a little baggier without any type of cinching near the wrist so they can kind look frumpy instead of cute but otherwise I love it."
4.0,It was a little smaller than I wanted so I must return it....I do like it!!
4.0,Beautiful dress.. fabric is a bit thin.
4.0,"Smaller than I'd hoped, but just as described.  Good leather bag."
4.0,"This brand runs a little snug in this particular dress.  I am 5'5 and 150 lbs.  I usually wear a large in most things.  I ordered the XL; but, it's still snug.  I love the neckline and sleeve length.  The fabric is nice and it is fairly well made."
4.0,"I was really hoping this was THE bag. Finding a reasonably priced 'masculine' looking tote has been a challenge. Not that it bothers me, I'm just more understated for work and most bags I found were just too much. Cheaply constructed, too busy, too many embellishments, patterns too small, too strappy, not large enough, or just a straight up purse. In the photo that sold me this bag it appeared to be everything I wanted in a tote. When the item arrived, it was less tote and more briefcase. Soft supple leather, solid interior lining, built to last, classic and well constructed but not a tote and too small to be used as a tote so I unfortunately sent it back.<br />I totally recommend this bag for a laptop work bag it's just not what I needed, I have two laptop bags I love and rotate out. I know the listing said messenger bag but the photo gives tote. That aside, if you're on the fence about this, for the price and quality this bag is a steal."
4.0,these are actually really sturdy I use them for college showers just a little bummed there was no 9.5 but overall they're great
4.0,"These are really nice fabric, nicely made but are not really true to size.  They are a little larger than I expected."
4.0,I like the design and the sleeve button details.<br />It is true to size and looks nice. Great for jeans or dress pants.  I will give it 5 stairs if the neck will be more pressed. It seams that the material is easy to wrinkle.
4.0,"I love the concept, fits well under my bra, the arms are a bit tight, spandex material but nothing I couldn't handle"
4.0,"Supplier refunded my money without requiring the gloves to be returned. I followed the guidelines for size and ordered Small. The gloves are still too big. The part fitting over the palm is way too wide (will probably fit a man's hand better. Finger lengths are too long as well. So clearly they're made for men, not for women. Product quality is good. Received it a day later than was due."
4.0,"EL PEDIDO FUE ENTREGADO LUEGO DEL RECLAMO REALIZADO, ESTOY SATISFECHO CON LA SOLUCIÓN OFRECIDA"
4.0,"I get many compliments, but like everyone else says, fits a bit big and are rough material, much better after a few washes."
4.0,"Old review &#34;I was excited at first since i loved my first beanie Bluetooth headset but after a little bit of usage I was thoroughly let down. The audio is ok, a small step down from standard headphones but nothing too bad. The microphone cut off so much during phone calls that it was pretty much useless for making calls. Seems a little flimsy,  so I'm not really sure if it would be practical for extremely cold weather.  Was fairly tight on my head though , causing my ears to get irritated after about 10 minutes of useage. Will most likely get a refund.&#34;<br />UPDATE<br />I was sent a replacement which led me to believe that the first headset was defective since the new one worked like a charm.  They sent me a different model which fis better and sounds better.  Not to mention hands free calling worked like a charm (i think the microphone in my original was broken). Overall great headset  but I'm going to have to deduct a star for the defective one."
4.0,Great shirt for the price - nice artwork
4.0,Love this outfit super cute giving one star less because the headband was flimsy there was no grip and kept falling off her head
4.0,Got this for Halloween last year for a work event.  It wasn't too scandalous (I wore a dress underneath) and it was very warm.  The downside was that it sheds everywhere and isn't the best quality.
4.0,Very pretty! My only complaint is that it didn’t fit around my wrists so I gave it to my daughter.
4.0,Pretty good pants and they are comfortable. Satisfied with my buy.
4.0,"smells bad on the inside , but after awhile it goes away. cut bag for a few nights and holds what you need. not bad"
4.0,"I’m 6’4” 250lbs, size 18 neck, it’s fits snug on my face."
4.0,"I haven't worn the pendant yet, but have it hung up, and enjoy seeing it."
4.0,"Very pretty dress, with soft fabric, but much too small around the bust. I had to return it."
4.0,I like the colors- the shades aren’t as dark or reflective as the picture made it look. And the frames are kinda thin which some people probably like and some don’t.
4.0,A bit more purple-ish than plum
4.0,It runs a bit small but I have no complaints.  I would purchase again.
4.0,I love this top! It’s a little shorter than I wanted but I’m going to order it in a new size and I will let you know how it fits! Might’ve been because of my boobs and me growing a bit caused by the covid!
4.0,Well made case. Fits well on my kit and on my belt. Arrived on time and well packaged.
4.0,"Just as described,  great to lounge around in."
4.0,"It’s pretty, and fancy looking! Add a pair of fancy shoes and bam you’re ready for a fancy party! Honestly it’s pretty, and a good modest length too"
4.0,I've gotten a lot of compliments on this bag!
4.0,"Love these socks, I'm on my feet all day & these make my legs feel light, thank you for the relief!"
4.0,"Feels good. Haven't worn them yet for a long period of time, though."
4.0,"These glasses are fantastic!  We use them for hockey!  Any type of sports glasses fog up on the ice for my kiddo.  These are super flexible if he gets hit with a puck in the helmet the glasses don’t make it hurt worse.  I’m ordinary my 2nd pair of frames now, the metal is starting to wear through....but after 2 years of hockey abuse, I can NOT complain!"
4.0,This wallet was a perfect asset to my purse.
4.0,Bello pero el tamaño es pequeño para hombres
4.0,"Purchase this for my husband to use during travel it works well on upper arm, or ankle. A little difficult to get to for purchasing items, however just to keep things safe when traveling it is perfect"
4.0,The shirt fits great!  For some reason I thought the fabric was going to be slightly different but overall happy with the shirt for my kid!
4.0,"I love it, but it was too small. I'm usually a medium and I followed the sizing chart and got an extra large and the arms were too small. Order a size bigger than what the sizing chart says."
4.0,"Ordered smaller size for a 'loose' fit but is only a 'comfortable/slightly close' fit. My black & white plaid is not soft, has a 'wool blend' feel. Inside is lined with a smooth fabric. Seems to be a good warmth for a chilly house."
4.0,"Perfect mother’s day gift! It was a little small around the wrist, but my mom added a link to it and now it’s her new favorite bracelet!"
4.0,"Product is very comfortable. The fabric is soft snd stretchy, perfect for working out."
4.0,Ordered this shirt again in an XL. I originally ordered a L which fit but it was just to short on the side where the slit is. With the XL it is a bit better.. so size up and just know that the slit still goes up to side of bra almost.
4.0,Really cute but very small. Order up!
4.0,good view during sunny days.
4.0,"The chains are as pictured. Even though it's an adjustable chain you can only really wear it at one length in order for the bar and the gen to be even. It is very cheap product but for the price you shouldn't, and I didn't expect more. But it's a very nice necklace considering. I read that sine people say the chains look different. The necklace I received looks exactly like the picture. The only reason why I'm not giving a 5 star is because of the adjustment issue."
4.0,Fit me.  Heavy warm sweater. Would have preferred round neckline for more warmth. V neckline was ok and not too low like some 3x shirts can be.
4.0,"I really liked them lot, l thought the elastic was kind of tight. Maybe they will stretch w wear"
4.0,"This is a great little leotard.  However it is too big.  I don't take stars away for sizing though.  I took a star away because the cut of the crotch is really high cut for a Dance or gymnastics class.  These leotards should fit lower cut like briefs not bikini.  I love the snap close since we aren't potty training yet.  I was tempted to resew the crotch and cut it, but I want to give her a chance to grow into it."
4.0,like it.. It likes to slide on the visor
4.0,The white under bodice is smaller than expected.
4.0,I received mine today.  This is really nice. Its heavy and rich looking. This is a rich looing product especially for the price I paid.
4.0,Arrived ahead of time and are very colorful! Each one is different. They are also  very lightweight. They will make cute stocking stuffers!
4.0,This is a beautiful boot style and is super light weight. I usually wear a 7W in Linden Wood women's boot. I ordered a size 7 of this boot and it wasn't wide enough for my foot to be comfortable. It's not something ordering a larger size will fix because I've had this issue with other styles of Timer land boots. Disappointing because they are very cute.
4.0,"Beautiful, dainty little earrings that add a bit of color and interest. The rose gold color is a nice touch, though the opal looks fake if you get close up to them."
4.0,Amszing fit and material
4.0,"These durags have long ends and diverse colors which is all dope to me, they work perfectly fine as a durag."
4.0,"I bought this bag while ago and loved it UNTIL the shoulder strap started peeling off and the burlap dust got all over whatever I was wearing. I have to confess that I was wearing it as school bag, so it must've been heavy on the bag. :)  It IS the best looking Feed bag.<br />[...]"
4.0,"I love love these tanks, I order a medium and wear them as undershirts as I can hardly stand a bra cutting into my shoulder. My only complaint is every single order I have had at least one of them fall apart around the arm because the seam gave out. Sure would be nice to buy something without having to repair it..."
4.0,Small. Delicate cute gift for a child . A little small for women.
4.0,"The look of the slippers with accent on the straps ,great house shoe."
4.0,"This briefcase is a bang for my buck.  I had trouble with the conbination lock one of the prongs had to be bent into shape, but other than that Its a good buy.  I bought it for my son and he loves it."
4.0,I gave it a four star because it doesn’t come with filter material to add inside the pouch.
4.0,"The pendant in and of itself is very lovely, as the picture shows. As some have said, the cord is tied a bite awkwardly, but that's an easy fix. Great detail; love the five ""dots"" right by the gem - as well as those around the border - to match the five points/elements. However, the gem is not as shown, at least in my case. This pendant was made to have an empty spot in the center to go with the other five; I received it with a rhinestone/sequens-like ""jewel"" glued into the center hole. (There was even glue smeared across it a bit.) I would pry out the jewel and just leave it be on its own but pewter is so sensitive. Other versions of this pendant are out and about that contain fake gems in the small five holes, too. So, for the lack of a real gem, the price may be a bit steep, but the details of the rest of this piece (and 'free' shipping) make up for it, I think."
4.0,Darling tee! Loved the fabric but runs extremely small... I gave it to my daughter.
4.0,"Very Pretty dress, good quality for the price. Just too small. Could not get the back zipped up all the way. I don’t have a big chest for my size so it wasn’t that. More in the waist/lower rib cage area.  Bought this in the  white floral  for my casual end of summer wedding in a 16. I normally wear a 14. Probably going to order the next size or two up. Also thinking of buying it in white as well. My husband to be is a Marylin Monroe fan and I think it gives off that vibe especially in white. Ordered the floral because I didn’t want to look overly “brideish”( this is my second marriage)But now that I tried the dress and see how pretty it is I am really considering white. Absolutely measure your waist and bust before you choose a size ladies 🙂"
4.0,"This was a birthday gift, they are much smaller than I expected"
4.0,Like the fabric and fit.
4.0,"The graphic should have been moved up closer to the collar, but other than that it was just fine"
4.0,This bag is really cute. I bought the white (which is more of an off white due to the fabric) . I love the look of the leather handles and it's much wider than I was expecting which is great because I have two kids and am always lugging tons of stuff. Mine came with a bright yellow credit card holder. It's cute and perfect for the summer however a small zipper bag would be more practical. As others reviewed there is a terrible smell emulating from the bag. I mixed up some essential oils/alcohol/water and gave it a good spray down. After letting it sit overnight the smell is completely gone. Overall I'm happy with this purchase. This is a great addition to my summer bags.
4.0,Style is cute. Very thin materail. Worn under a corset it should work o'kay.
4.0,Beautiful shoe but tight around the toes and I have narrow feet. Hoping they will stretch with time.
4.0,"This anklet was very nice. It is great for a cruise or just a day out. It looks just like the picture. It's not too big, but it's recognizable. It was easy to put on. It was comfortable to wear. The clasp worked fine. It felt fine. I liked it and would recommend it."
4.0,I love the fact that it was so pretty and feminine. At the beginning of the day when I the first time I wore it it was a little tight but as the day wore on it stretched so by the end of the day it was perfect!
4.0,"I like this dress but if you have a big booty be careful! The cut outs come up high and could show off your butt. It was great quality and the rest of the sizing was good. I am 5'3&#34; 135 pounds and wear a small in shirts and 28 waist, I ordered a medium but I could have used a large."
4.0,It’s a comfy relax around the house garment.
4.0,It’s ok quality for the price. It’s thin so it’s see through. I’m 5’4” 151 and got a medium wish I would have gotten a L. It’s cute tho.
4.0,This will be perfect for those chilly days of soccer for my girl. It'll keep the hair out of her face and still keep the cute factor for her peers. Looks like decent quality and should hold upto the abuse of a teenage girl. I received this product at a discount for a review
4.0,Bought this for my grandson’s first Easter. It was a hit!
4.0,"It is a very form fitting jacket. Runs on the smaller side. I returned the one I purchased, because it had a stain on the front of it. Overall, nice jacket."
4.0,"Really love the shirt. Good for the summer and getting compliments from people. Especially awesome for upcoming Father's Day. I highly recommend getting in touch with seller to choose design as that option isn't available at checkout yet, hopefully in the future. Received shirt fast after it shipped out."
4.0,"I love the idea of these, but, I ordered my sons correct size and they were too small"
4.0,"This is a nice-looking sweater, but you better get a size larger than you would normally wear. I am 6'2"", and have broad shoulders and long arms, so I ordered the XXLarge and it is boarder-line too small. I don't like sweaters to fit tight, so I would suggest getter a size up from what you think you should wear. It feels like a nice quality's and the way it looks is very nice."
4.0,"These shoes look great, very lightweight.  But they are enormous.  Ordered a half size up from what my son is currently wearing.  These are at least an inch and a half longer."
4.0,I really like these. Going to get for all five of my daughters!
4.0,Lovely scarf. Material is soft to touch and a great length. Colors are exactly as described. Not too hot to wear but keeps you warm.
4.0,Nice ring but they run small so get it a bit bigger than your original size
4.0,Comfortable shirt not very stain resistant.
4.0,"The outfit is cute as it is, however, the only thing I would suggest is to make the little shoes smaller! I had to adjust the black pair of slip ons because they did fit a little big on my little one."
4.0,I wish they offered it in more colors. It is a great ring. I love it.
4.0,"just get one size up, its very cute"
4.0,Comfortable mostly. Need to offer some larger sizes. I got the largest and I need a bit more room. I'm 36 and pretty flat. Kept them as I need non padded for work.
4.0,"I wanted another Style if earings like my first order. However, I missed the size detail. These were much smaller than I wanted. I will try again."
4.0,I like these a lot but my boobs are a bit large so the adhesive isn't strong enough to support the weight of my breast. (I am a 36D) But it did the job the first few times I used the bra. So I got my money's worth.
4.0,I don’t have much to say other than this sunglasses is so awesome
4.0,"They seem a little small, but I might just have a huge face. Otherwise, exactly as described."
4.0,"This is a generally okay piece of swimwear. There are two notable downsides. First it tends to restrict movement at the armpits. Not a great feature when you want your arms free for aqua sports. The other is that there is a single layer of material in the chest region. This makes it feel a little...unwholesome should I take a dip in water that is too chilly, if you get my drift.<br /><br />Otherwise, it is a nice shirt. The material is generally thick enough that I don't expect to have problems with minor abrasions. The sizing is a bit odd. I'm about 5'10"", slender build, 125 lbs. The general fit is okay, but a bit tighter than I would expect. Interestingly, the arms are actually about three inches too long. I guess this is designed for women who are 6 feet tall but weigh 115-120 lbs. I'd guess that the model market isn't THAT large. But maybe I'm wrong, considering that these are designed this way."
4.0,"Heavy, for Florida kitchen work, but nice. Made in Bagledish."
4.0,Really like this nose ring
4.0,Husband loves these HUK shirts!! Comfy and lightweight. True
4.0,Very much liked them and so did my daughter!
4.0,"This is a cute sweater for the price. It’s pretty thin material but I expected that. It fits great! I’m 5’ tall, 110 lbs and I got the small. It’s short but doesn’t get too short when I lift my hands up. I’m happy with this purchase."
4.0,I originally got the large/extra large for a present for my boyfriend but it was way too large! I saw the other reviews saying it was large but my boyfriend is 6'4&#34; and 185lbs so I figured it'd fit. We ended up exchanging it for the small/medium. It fits well now and even has long enough sleeves for him which can be an issue a lot of times. It's still has tons of room but is much more comfortable and a good size to lounge around the house.
4.0,I ordered the light cyan. The picture on Amazon doesn’t look as blue as it is. I wish it was a little more cream so it wouldn’t clash with most clothes. The fit of the large is almost as described. My wrist is near the top of the size range and it leaves small imprints on my wrist. If it fit the range it says it wouldn’t have done that.
4.0,Not my favorite dress ever but is comfortable and fits as expected. Longer than I expected. Great for a casual beach day to dinner.
4.0,"Nice colors, fit well. Works well for my fiance."
4.0,SO ADORABLE IN PERSON. THIS IS MADE WITH A LIGHT WEIGHT MATERIAL THAT IS PERFECT FOR A HOT SUMMER DAY. I CANT WAIT TO SEE IT ON HER.
4.0,The color is pretty
4.0,"These fit great! I havent worn tbem in the water yet, but i do like how they look and fit"
4.0,I ended up returning it because I found another dress to use for what I was getting it for. It was really comfy and I loved that the pockets were good sized. The size fit as expected. I'm a size 6-8 and the small fit great. I'm debating ordering it in black.
4.0,"Bought these for my wife as a Christmas Present. She thought they were a little too long but loved the materials feel, comfy waist band and the patterns"
4.0,"My step daughter LOVES these bracelets.  To me they felt a little cheap, but then again...who other than a little girl would wear them.  As long as she's happy, I'm happy."
4.0,"Durags are nice. The wave cap is also a great add on to this product, it helps lay the hair down very well. The only reason i didnt give 5 stars was because these durags are a mix between satin and silky and i just wanted silky, but great product overall."
4.0,"I bought these for my husband who stopped wearing his gold band out of fear of losing his finger at work. Two sizes allowed me to be unsure about his exact ring size (the larger size fit perfectly). He doesn't feel like he's wearing a ring, so he has kept it on straight through since trying it on the first day (5 days ago). I wish there was data on how many pounds of pressure it takes to break this ring, just for safety info., but it does stretch so I'm fairly certain we could cut it off if an injury demanded such action. The blue is a bit bright for our taste; the gray was too small -- but we both like how the black looks."
4.0,I wear these as a bathing suit bottom They are great because I can stretch them out if i'm walking around and wear them tighter when sunning.
4.0,What a bargain!  The dress fit my 14 year old grand daughter perfectly.  The fabric was a nice weight (not flimsy) and true to size.
4.0,I loved it but it was definitely too big and i had to return it. I suggest ordering a size smaller than usual.
4.0,"Material is very thin, made a great gift to a friend"
4.0,"sleeves were to short, nice jacket though."
4.0,"Fit as expected. Very warm pants. The knee area is huge, almost too big which looks weird."
4.0,It’s for people who want something like a stringer without exposing ones entire back. I’ll most likely buy more. They need more colors though.
4.0,supper comfortable
4.0,This is a nice quality product that fits as expected.
4.0,The fit is a bit large but it leaves room for layering in the winter. I love this cardigan sweater. It's nubby and warm. It is made well and has a bit of wool in it. I know it will serve me well for years to come.
4.0,Patterns and color
4.0,"Won't be needed around these parts for awhile. In Florida, it is a bit warm most of the time. During cooler weather though, you could wear this button down shirt type dress with a pair of boots and look smashing."
4.0,I had to return it as it was too small for my commerative medal but it is of good quality
4.0,Top a little smaller than expected
4.0,of course its always a better pic than delivery but we are very happy with our purchase.  would buy again
4.0,nice sweater but fits a little snug.
4.0,"A lovely watch, but the clasp is very difficult. You really need two hands to fasten it. Also the numbers do not glow in the dark. But it is very beautiful, so four stars."
4.0,"I like the material and the fit is great, except it was tight around the thighs. There’s no stretch"
4.0,They're good but they are very small. I would use a pocket square holder with these. Unless you're just using a presidential fold.
4.0,Good product but  Fits smaller than expected.
4.0,"I just love my wool winter gloves.  They are a little small, but they feel cozy on."
4.0,Kind of a weird fit. It goes out at the hips a bit and doesn’t create a very elongating line.
4.0,these are very cute earrings but the stem is too long and slides front to back and looks weird ...although they are very easy to take on and off the front ball (larger one) is almost too large that it always moves down and bothers me when i sleep....other than that they are very cute and well made.
4.0,"Follow the sizing on the item page, not your usual sizing. I am a 14 and my pajamas in the 5XL fit just the smidgiest on the large side. Pajamas are vibrant and comfortable though not as breathable as other pajamas. Probably more suited for cooler temps"
4.0,Liked the dress just wished it was 2 inches longer.
4.0,Love these glasses. The look is just like Tony Stark and Peter Parker. I do have a smaller head so they fit large on me but are still worth it. The quality of the glasses is really good too.
4.0,"Nice for the bucks, zippers are a little sticky"
4.0,"I love this dress. It fits well and is very comfy. However, the green is not true to the picture. Mine is very dark, definitely more of a fall/winter color than summer.<br /><br />I do intend to buy this dress in other colors. 5'8&#34; 170 llbs, bought a large. It fits well and is not too tight. The length comes right to my knees making it appropriate for work or more casual fun."
4.0,gb zdfsdcS
4.0,Can't live without the side pockets for my cell phone. Good fit. The blue is very bright.
4.0,These do not ride up. A little bit on the small size. But can wear.
4.0,Muibuena cálida
4.0,"This belt is gorgouse and goes with practically everything (i got it in black). It would have been five stars bht everytime I sit or bend, the darn thing unhooks and I have to put it back on. Little embarrassing in public. Its kind of the equivalent of buying high heel pumps and then not being able to walk in them without falling. BUT if you're very mindful about your movements this belt is adorable."
4.0,They run a little small. Seem to be durable and of decent quality. Touchscreen part worked flawless on iPhone X. Bought for my lady and she loved them in the cold. I like that they didn’t seem bulky and she didn’t have issue like thicker gloves with her coordination. She said they were warm.
4.0,I ordered this for my 7 year old daughter. My daughter is petite and skinny and so it was maybe too large for her. The dress though is beautiful. She wore it at a wedding and she got lots of compliments !!!
4.0,Not a huge fan. Material is very thin and flimsy. The shirt is way too short.
4.0,"I do like this blouse a lot, but the sleeves are a little too long.  It is very feminine and soft.  Looks good with jeans. Other than the sleeves, it is a perfect fit."
4.0,"I bought this to make a diaper cake do as far as the fit, I made it fit."
4.0,"A very nice light weight cardigan. Thinner material, soft fabric, stretchy, with nice sized pockets. It’s just really long. I’m 5’6” and it’s almost to my knees. Feels like I’m wearing a robe."
4.0,Dress is very nicely made but the arms and shoulders were way to tight. I would recommend ordering a size up.
4.0,Always like blublockers
4.0,I WAS  really excited  when my watch arrived the other day because mine broke about a week ago and had been using my kids watch because I work in the medical field and need a watch with a second hand on it to check vitals so since my kids watch had one I had to use it till I got a new one. But let me start by telling you some of the features that I personally liked about this CakCity sports watch. The first thing that caught my eye was the simple yet comfortable watch. Also I really like that it is water proof because working in the medical field and have to constantly wash my hand countless times a day. Also the band was really comfortable for me to wear while working. Even though I did receive this product for free or at a discount in no way did that reflect my review my reviews are always honest and my own. But I would definitely recommend this watch to anybody that works in the medical fields or just some one that wants a great yet simple watch.<br /><br />if you have any questions about this watch feel free to ask me<br />IF YOU FOUND MY REVIEW TO BE HELPFUL PLEASE CHECK THIS WAS HELPFUL. THANKS!!!
4.0,"I like that these are comfortable. They can be adjusted, although it takes some messing with it to get it adjusted. I have even washed them after getting thrown up on by my toddler and they came out of the wash and dryer perfectly. The black one did break the first time I used it but I was able to pop the pin back in and fix it."
4.0,These are my favorite sunglasses. Fits me perfectly. It doesn't slide down my nose when its hot.
4.0,"Cute, but make sure you have a steamer. It came deeply creased. Also, runs really large."
4.0,These are pretty much an exact dupe for gym shark! Worth the purchase they fit amazing and are super cute! I’m 5’8 170 / waist 28in / hips 42in / thighs 24in / purchased a medium.
4.0,GOOD CHRISTMAS GIFT
4.0,"I bought this wallet for my husband.  Even though the Vette emblem is wrong (should have been a C5), he likes its compact style."
4.0,"Wore to a Seahawks game, I don't think anyone noticed that it was not the $50 nfl licensed version. Kept my head nice and warm. It is meant to be worn over the forehead, so not super great if you have bangs, but it worked."
4.0,My wife said she like it because it's pretty
4.0,Nice product but for thicker framed glasses they break easy going on frame. Was little challenging getting them on.
4.0,Comfortable and nice top.
4.0,Was very nice just as expected
4.0,Top is a little small and the pockets are too high on the sides.
4.0,"the muffs does what it's suppose to, which is reduce the noise when firing weapons or opering loud machine tools... my only complaint is they squeeze my head pretty tightly... maybe i have a big head idk. right now I'm on a putting them on something the size of a pineapple hoping they'll stretch"
4.0,"I really like this rain gear, even looks and feels better then I expected. Although as I inspected the jacket, the left side elastic strap was not attached.<br />I like to send it back, buts a minor issue that I temporary fix."
4.0,Nice cotton hat
4.0,"This is a really pretty necklace. The size is a lot bigger than I was expecting. I was thinking the peace sign would be about the size of a fifty cent piece, but it's about twice that size, more like the size of an Oreo. The chain is not great quality. It was a little kinked up when I got it. Also, some of the stones aren't set perfectly, so I'm worried they will eventually fall out. For the price, it is a great necklace. It's really cute and can go together with a lot of different outfits. It's great to spruce up a plain sweater or dress. I received this product in exchange for an honest review. I did pay the list price for it ($3.22 at the time of this review), so it wasn't really a promotion. All opinions and experiences are my own."
4.0,The foot part is very long.
4.0,"These are solid sunglasses. They are light and well fitting, even on my large noggin. They are not cheaply made either. Well worth the money."
4.0,I am a size 11 but it came small. I should have gotten a size up. A bit uncomfortably but I guess I'll get used to it.
4.0,Very cute! Easy to wash and nice flattering fit. Only problem was I wore it to a concert and when I jumped around the strap which is buttoned kept coming undone on the left shoulder. It may not be suitable for dancing! But I do like the thick material and that it is true to color and it fit me perfectly 😍
4.0,"used them for the first time this weekend,  A normal D.C. summer day hot and fairly humid.  Worked great  and could really tell the difference when I finished my ride and took them off while still in the sun.  Considering buying another pair to always have a clean set."
4.0,The light makes all the difference.
4.0,Super flat across the face they do not wrap around at all. Packaged very well with a decent case
4.0,"It's beautiful and thick material... much longer than it looks on the model however. She must be around 5'8&#34; or 5'10&#34;, so use that as a reference."
4.0,Bought for gifts. Don't know how they will fit. But they are thin.
4.0,"Very nice wallet ... it probably deserves a 5-star rating.  It is beautifully designed, the leather is smooth and soft, the card sleeves work well, and I enjoy using it.  The card slot in the hidden compartment is a little cumbersome to use, but is functional and works as advertised.  If the number of cards are within a couple of cards of being maxed out, it gets harder to retrieve to cards in the back compartment.  That being said, I love the looks, feel, and functionality of this wallet."
4.0,I really like this shirt. It is 100% polyester. It runs small. I wear an XS and this Small fits like a glove. Stretchy cute and soft. I wash in cold and hang to dry. I bought one in white as well.
4.0,"My husband is very picky, but yet wants it at a good price. This hat fit the bill! I think you will like it!"
4.0,"Very pretty.  I like that it both zips and snaps.  I am short.  It sits nicely across the body, not too long."
4.0,I was what I ordered and just what I needed
4.0,Good bang for your buck. Get a variety of chokers. Wish they would clasp a little tighter because they're still loose on my neck on the tightest hook for some of them. Some designs are also not as cute but it's okay since it's still a great value
4.0,"Very cute. Too long on me, but pattern on bottom makes it impossible to shorten, But have worn it and it's very comfortable."
4.0,Would also work for boys
4.0,"Shirt is good, nicker is bit tight but it’s ok at current age, not useful for next year at least.. otherwise good"
4.0,So far it serves its purpose and works
4.0,It looks as shown but not perfect for my body type. The back runs up short a bit. Other than that love it
4.0,"High quality; excellent packaging and add-ins.  Concept not proven, though do help some."
4.0,"Cute, just like the picture. Got 6-12. My daughter is in a 12 month and is was more like a 18 month."
4.0,Extremely see through!! these leggings are soo sheer. But cant complain too much the price is right. and my friend still loved them. They just wore black leggings underneath so their underwear wouldnt show through. the tag shows as well so u have to cut it off.
4.0,Shorter then expected
4.0,Lovely material. Solid made. Good zippers. I purchased 3 for gifts and had to return all 3 due sizing issues.
4.0,I like the fit and quality of this item but it was over priced!
4.0,"Wore these to a contact improvisation dance workshop. Lightweight and airy, nice when it gets warm. Don't count on carrying much in the pocket. I intend to wear them at Burning Man."
4.0,Love the shirt colors. Size a bit on the small size.
4.0,a good range of colours and very comfortable to wear.
4.0,"Very lovely piece, wore this to a club but gold color fades fast , chains did not break"
4.0,Niche quality stockings.
4.0,Words are kind of hard to read on the heart. It is nice.
4.0,"My wife is an avid yoga enjoyer. These, she tells me, fit well, although the length is a little unusul - They fall at th top of her knee (instead of more common yoga shorts which usually are a couple of inches above the knee). They have nice stretch, and the ""tummy control"" is not overly tight. Since she needs a ton of workout clothes, these are a good addition."
4.0,"Very cute shirt, however, it is somewhat see-through and thin. Under the arms is a large where you most definetly will need wear a camy underneath. But I like it! I'm 5'4&#34; 205 lbs (for your reference)"
4.0,the material is too thin
4.0,Tool that comes to adjust band broke first thing. Screws fell out of connector when I opened band. Found the screw and replaced. Connector will not stay connected to watch on one side. Very disappointed. Wasted 25 dollars. Do not buy. Revising review .... was sent replacement band and it worked better. Looks nice. Customer service was great.
4.0,"Did not read closely enough to notice these are not machine washable :-( But pretty blouse, color is true, and it fits before cleaning. Will update if that changes."
4.0,Nice sweater just wanted it to be baggieer
4.0,"Very cute and comfortable. I like the soft material. It doesn't look like the photo amazon has. The pink is a light neon, it's a thinner and stretchier material than what it appears in the photo, and the grays aren't as dark. I still like this cardigan very much."
4.0,"comfortable shoed, good price"
4.0,My granddaughter absolutely loves them!
4.0,These are valuable and help me run more confidently in the dark.  I'm pleased with the brightness and the ease of charging.  My only complaint is that the construction is slightly less substantial than I anticipated.  I'm afraid the plastic clips will be easily broken.
4.0,"I like the keychain, but the ""TARDIS keys"" tag does not move easily around the jump ring. I had to push it along when I added keys. It should (in my opinion) be a looser fit. I removed it and put it on a slightly smaller jump ring. If the artist would consider making the hole slightly larger, or providing a slightly smaller jump ring, that would be great."
4.0,"i ordered these a little over a month ago, and received 7 of the 8 pairs that come in the set. I contacted siikworld and informed them about it, and they shipped me the blue pair i was missing, their customer service is just outstanding and awesome, very polite and friendy, as for these briefs, i absolutely love them. I am a size 32 medium, so i ordered a large, and they fit wonderful. They are well made, soft feeling, and skin tight, they are very supportive and comfortable with a fully functional 2 button buttonfly. The back is almost full coverage, you will possibly have some butt cheek hanging out like i do, the front is very very low cut, however, they do stretch in the front just a little. I would rate these a 5 star, however, due to the very bare minimum of space in the front as you can see in the pictures, they get a 4 star rating. Over all, i am very pleased with these briefs, and will definitely order more from siikworld in the future."
4.0,Nicely designed and sturdy
4.0,"It's a pretty item, time will tell if the finish will last.  It was packaged really cute."
4.0,Look and functions met most of my expectations. Have yet to shut off a recurring alarm using your instructions.
4.0,"Awesome backpack, great space for my laptop and other gear. It's also light and remains lighter than most backpacks even filled. Going to buy my son one soon"
4.0,"These pants do run small, but they’re very stretchy and comfortable. I don’t want to order more than one size up however, as the waistband is fairly loose."
4.0,this is a fun piece. I bought it to wear with a specific dress and its a good enough quality to wear often.
4.0,"I like that they are small, lightweight and pretty.  I like that they come with a guarantee.  They are a bit hard to open but easily snap into themselves and latch securely.  Great for everyday wear and comfortable."
4.0,The style and color are great.  The material was a little more stiff than I expected but it still feels comfortable.
4.0,I am satisfied completely with every aspect of this item and the seller
4.0,"I'm 5'6, 135 pounds, athletic frame, top and bottom heavy. Runs a little small, but the bottoms fit nicely and were a little cheeky. The top was a little too small, found myself popping out once or twice when bending over."
4.0,"Fits as expected, and is a great color and cut but it arrived very wrinkled and tends to pick up new wrinkles pretty easily. I just have to remember to leave myself time to steam the wrinkles out in the morning or take it out of the closet, steam it, and leave it somewhere it's not getting mushed by other clothes the night before. I was hoping to use this as an easy travel dress, but with the wrinkle factor I don't think it will pack well. I might try the roll-up technique and give it a trail run, as travel was really the reason I purchased this."
4.0,"This is a very comfortable, casual pair of yoga-style pants. I don't participate in yoga exercises but still like wearing these pants to ""hang about"" in my home. The only minor issue for me is the length: I am short (5'2"" ) ... had these inseams been 2"" shorter, Perfect!"
4.0,No sun yet so un-tested so far.  However it's cute and colorful.
4.0,Ordered  3 of the same color  and  one  was  a different color  then I had  ordered
4.0,Super cute and very soft! The beanies run a little big. I love how cute my daughter looks in them.
4.0,"Used the pair for some dress shoes, help keep them in shape and maintain their original appearances for the most part"
4.0,It perfectly hides your back fat and brings it beautifully to your front.
4.0,"A pair of leather gloves lined with cashmere has always been a part of my wardrobe, but I lost one of my two gloves. These are a great replacement."
4.0,Very comfortable and this is the second pair I have owned. Gives more support than your basic slipper will purchase again.
4.0,"The fabric is soft on the face. When positioned properly, it doesn't let your glasses steam up as they do with regular masks. Requires a bit of stretching to get it to fit my head, but once that was accomplished, it's nice and reflects my antisocial views nicely and colorfully."
4.0,Nice product but does not fit as tight as you would want in a compression shirt.
4.0,Came late but good product
4.0,It’s cute. Definitely made for 10 and up though. Way too big for my 6 year old.
4.0,nice sturdy earrings - heavy duty locking
4.0,"little surprised how small it was...thought it was a bit longer and circumference a little bigger, this definitely a mini..."
4.0,Great value.  Durable.  The only thing is that they are a little large.  I prefer smaller lenses/frames.
4.0,I am a really skinny petite girl so its a tad big on me
4.0,Cute bag to keep your cell phone accessories.
4.0,"I was expecting the roses to be embroidered but it's literally just a picture of roses & it looks digitial, almost pixalated from expanding the graphic onto the bottoms. Still, it doesnt look bad. The bra band is not adjustable. It's just one silver latch that's a bit loose to be honest so beware of ending up suddenly topless in the water. the bra straps are adjustable so you can be comfortable or tighten them to lift the girls. While I ordered this because I like the roses stitched on style, I'm still not returning it because the top actually fit! Usually I order a large, the tags say L, and the top is an A-B cup -_- lol I'm 5'6&#34; 140lbs & wear a 34D."
4.0,"The product looks exactly like the image and I like it. If I had to notate a concern it would be that the leather appears to be a bit worn, even before I give to my nephew. But the style was right and the price was great, so will update on the quality after some wear-n-tear from my nephew."
4.0,Really good for the price that it is only I wasn't expecting the middle string it wasn't shown In the pic ...but over all really nice.
4.0,Good enough for the price. Plain with no logo. Little bit short in the torso but I just wore a black tank top underneath.
4.0,"I bought these because I have a really big head, but these glasses are way too big for me! People usually say that they have a forehead, but I have a 5 head. And these shades are still too big! Other than that they are in perfect condition and would look really nice on somebody with a huge fat head."
4.0,The horn was a little bent other than that perfect
4.0,Seems sturdy. I do like the matte finish.
4.0,Good value husband likes it
4.0,"Sturdy, nice gift, attractive.  Definitely too big for a woman"
4.0,Ordered these a super cute throw on and work shoe. They are just that. The color is super cute and the shape and quality is very nice. My only negative is that they begin to stretch so I should’ve bought the next size down. Other than that I will be purchasing again!
4.0,"I LOVE this top! Definitely order up one or two sizes if you have thicker arms or a belly you want to hide. I typically wear a medium or large depending on the style of top and I ordered this in an XL and it's perfect. I love the weight of the fabric, the cut, the arms are still snug but comfortably so and I have fat arms. I immediately ordered this top in black for wearing with colorful leggings and will be buying more colors!"
4.0,This necklace is HUGE and HEAVY wasn't expecting that
4.0,I bought this as a gift it was well made and she absolutely loved it because she is an elephant lover!
4.0,"Ordered for Cov 19 preventive and received within a few days.  Made in China.  Clear face shield portion is removable with zipper.  Once attached it is secure.  The hat is small.  Good for female or youth.  It is not fashionable but does not look too bad.  When you wear it,  it is pretty hot so I do not think I can use it for a longer period of time in summer  (use for a quick shopping, be in a elevator with several people etc.) .  I still plan to wear a mask when I use this hat.  It serves the purpose and considering the price,  this was a good buy."
4.0,The quality it great and they are super cut but the pads are oddly shaped and hard too adjust.
4.0,"I love this bright and unique shirt dress. I get a lot of compliments on it. I had to send the medium back for a large. When I ordered a medium at first, I saw that the package said ""small."" When I ordered a large, the package said, ""medium."" Confusing sizing, but it was worth it. I wear it to work and feel both professional and beautiful."
4.0,Very nice could have been a little bigger to adjust 2 people who have larger wrists
4.0,"I love the vibrant color but it's a bit big for my wrist,  it didn't let me choose a size... I still wear it though!"
4.0,Very nice. Impressed my friends.
4.0,The material of the legging has a chemical smell. Even after washing the legging the smell continues
4.0,Purchased this as a gift and recieved it on time and the colors are very pretty.  Looks just like the picture.
4.0,This product was not the material I was expecting. It’s basically a t-shirt with buttons. It’s on the long side but flattering shape. I just was expecting it to be a higher quality fabric.
4.0,Umbrella was great but did not work in my backyard. The company took about a month to send my refund. They charged a small fee for shipping and a small fee was subtracted from my refund.
4.0,"light, good size, works as promised"
4.0,I used this product as poo pouri holders gift for my co-workers. It is clipped on their badges and they use it discretely. Thank you and so do my nose.
4.0,very pretty but they don't have backings. Make sure you put something on them or you may lose them
4.0,The arms are really large.
4.0,I really like this necklace. It’s a fun pice. Can be worn both casual and dressy
4.0,It fitted very well
4.0,"Four stars because it's a gorgeous dress, isn't too short, the fabric drapes nicely, and the corseted backing allows for adjustable sizing. My own fault was ordering it too small, because some reviews said the dress arrived in sizes too big."
4.0,"Very cute, nice quality.  Very nice Christmas gift for mom and daughter"
4.0,Overall I loved the dress!  It was comfortable I got a size larger because it was body forming and I didn't want it to be skin tight. Loved the colors.  I have a large chest and the fabric was petty much see through all though that was the only spot.
4.0,"Pros: For a unicorn mask, the quality is pretty good. The paint/hair is done well and there aren't any messed up seams in the plastic/rubber.<br /><br />Cons:<br />It smells bad, like cheap rubber. It sucks because you put your face in it.<br />It comes rolled up, so the mask and especially the horn are hard to get into the correct shape. I still haven't gotten it 100%.<br /><br />Overall: Smells bad but looks cool if you can get it unrolled and formed right."
4.0,I really liked the look and feel of the crossbody purse.  It has the quality and durability of an expensive purse but the capacity to carry just what you need.  Perfect for shopping trips or going out.  Great quality and worth the price!
4.0,"We measured as they instructed but fit was extremely too small. Wished they fit because quality of leather was superb, very lovely glove, color was amazing."
4.0,I needed yet another black dress. (But quick) To attend an event. Amazon is my go to. This dress is typical me. I like the way it fits near my shoulders. I’ve put on a couple of pounds over the holidays. So this dress fits a little snug . Once I drop 7 pounds. I will like the.fit even better.
4.0,"Great jacket, just a bit bigger than expected."
4.0,"VERY PRETTY, NOT VERY SHOWY.  WISH IT WAS A BIT BIGGER."
4.0,"Very cute dress, fits like a glove, product accurately described. It is very lacy if that is the style you are going for."
4.0,Loved this shirt but they are true to size. Very nice material and it fit but just not enough room in the stomach area.
4.0,Fit well  but if your short it below the knee for sure
4.0,"I am reviewing the Angerella High neck hollow out bikini bathing suit in black and I have to say it is pretty cute!  After a read a few of the reviews before making my purchase, I noticed quite a few people say that it runs small so I got a large. I am 5’4 and 135 lbs so it seemed to fit me pretty well. I would normally get a medium but the suit did run a little smaller. The good thing is there are ties around the neck and back for the bra so its easy to adjust to your body type.<br />The bikini top is lightly padded and has great detailing around the neckline with the crisscross look. Im always worried what I would look like if I did happen to get a suntan but I guess I will have to worry about that later. The bottoms were pretty plain but did the job as well. Would have been nice if there were cute ties on the side or something different but its just a typical bikini bottom.<br />The swimsuit comes in a variety of colors so I might try a different color next time. The material and quality are pretty good and it comes in a cute zip up pounch when it first arrives in the mail. Perfect for a day out at the beach or I can image the top can be worn separately out to festivals and other events. I give it 2 thumbs up.<br /><br />.*****I received this discounted product in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. I am under no obligation to provide a positive review and receive no incentives or rewards or compensation for positive reviews. This review is my own and I have personally tried the product. I hope you enjoy the review. ****"
4.0,Perfect!! Comfortable and saved my ears.
4.0,"My son plays indoor soccer and he loves these shoes. They are very comfortable and resistant. My boy is a very energetic kid and shoes don't last long, but these pair seem to be very resistant. Fair price for good shoes."
4.0,"Adorable dress, but I just decided I was too old for it (I'm in my 60s and was drawn to the retro look).  I'm a seamstress and I was pleasantly surprised how well this dress was made, given the price.  If you think it's cute, order it!  You won't be disappointed."
4.0,"I really like this dress, but it had a weird snap on the chest to keep the pieces of fabric together so you don’t see too much cleavage or your bra. Normally I don’t mind that in a wrap-style dress, but the snap seemed to be placed too high. The snap made the front look really odd, and pulled at the fabric so it didn’t lay in nice straight lines. I don’t know how to explain it! I am also pretty small chested so I can only imagine how it would look on larger chested women.<br />I ended up just cutting the thread holding the snap in place and throwing the snap away. Now the dress fits perfectly and doesn’t show my bra or too much cleavage even with the snap gone."
4.0,"This snow camo fabric appears to be adequate, although the mesh might have been a little finer to improve its function."
4.0,It was a Birthday present for my 9 year old twin grandsons. They liked them very much. For the price I think they are great.
4.0,Compared to shirts in 10/12 which fit great.  This is more like he is swimming in it maybe 14/16 size buy smaller size.  light material
4.0,It looks good the shipment was very quick the only reason why I didn’t give it five stars was that the hair on the back of the mask was a little thin
4.0,My husband wore this for a Masquerade Ball and it was perfect!
4.0,"I ordered a pair of these from Triple Optic and they are awesome, look just like in the picture; a nice deep red.  Then I ordered 2 more for my mom and her friend from another seller and they're pink, not red as the title states.  MAKE SURE YOU BUY FROM TRIPLE OPTIC, unless you know another seller that sells the actual red ones."
4.0,Bought the black net version and had to go up a size. Really pretty but loses a star because they chose to put a white lining under the solid black body material but it shows a little under the net.
4.0,"Great color, feeling, fit!"
4.0,I ordered these to give as a gift. The metal is shiny and they look like a sharp pair of cufflinks. I don't know how well they held up but my son liked them and wears them often. They are easy to apply and look good with his dress shirts.
4.0,"This was super fun and I wanted to keep it. The color is vibrant! However, there is no way to adjust it. It was too big and due to not being able to adjust, it had to be returned."
4.0,The necklace is really pretty and a good size but the cord is kinda thin and I'm scared that if I have it on while I'm asleep the cord will snap. other than that it is one of my favorites.
4.0,Gorgeous! Get it! Great quality
4.0,"This is a really cute and flattering dress. The only thing I don't like is that it ties behind the neck with very thick straps, so if you want to wear a little cardigan or something over it, it looks kind of goofy. You can't tell from the listing so I was surprised, but overall I still like it."
4.0,Comfortable and added just the extra support needed. Wouldn’t wear under clothes that are already tight across the top to help hold breast up. Danced and was sweating all night and it never slipped or came unstuck
4.0,"Some of these are pretty cute, others are cheaply made. I'd say they're worth the low price, but ymmv."
4.0,Seems pretty good. Its fit isn't too good though. The eye ride about half way down my eys though so I have to figure out how to hold the mask up like insert some filler in the skull.
4.0,"This chain set is sparkly and lovely.  It arrives well in a beautiful little suede bag with a nice box and cleaning cloth - all which make it a great gift.<br /><br />The chain is very thin and will tangle easily.  The chain is also very short.  This set is definitely for thinner people.  My teenager is wears a women's S/M and it fits her fine.  Me, not so much.  Sad as I got this for myself as a birthday present."
4.0,"It is very small. 12m fits like 6m. The quality is okay, but not amazing. It is a good play bodysuit for outside."
4.0,"For how much i paid for it it was nice<br />But it was copper, and after a say or two i had to put sealer on it where my finger was going to be so it would not turn my finger green"
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:b6a1a59bcff6e88dac6c45fd8cfc1a50]] Very nice fx. Fairly easy to apply, and moves with skin realistically. Only downside is it’s very sticky, so be very careful when opening the box. The applicant will stick to anything and is not easy to get of without stretching the piece. The edges were a bit noticeable, but not many people at the parties I went to noticed. Overall, awesome product."
4.0,So pretty and dainty. Just gets tangled easily
4.0,"Nice, warm, and cute. However they do run small, the biggest size fist my average size 7 year old just right and will be too small next year when he is 8."
4.0,"This scarf is not silk, but it is worth the price."
4.0,"Worked great, we bought a 3rd one! We had them all embroidered for presents for workers of our cattle ranch!"
4.0,"many compliments! the color is actually black though, not the gray shown"
4.0,The size is  got is a 36C and I think I could I'd have gone bigger because they seem to run small. Overall I love the coverage and push up. Although the shipped is bad would prefer to leave my package in the mail my dog for a hike of the package. I had never had problem when it comes to purchasing anything on Amazon or the shipment until today. I live Amazon and I prefer Amazon.
4.0,These are fun and decorative socks. I bought them as park of my theme for a team function. They are slightly smaller than I'd hope for. Pikachu's face looked stretched out when wearing them. But that might be because my calves are slightly bigger. Fits my wife just fine.<br />4stars because of the stretched pikachu face
4.0,"I never thought I'd say I love an apron, but here I am, loving this apron. I wish it was just a few inches longer with an adjustable neck strap, but it's pretty awesome as is. Being a plus size girl, I wasn't sure about the size, but it fits nicely and the ties are long enough for me. I really appreciate the pockets too - my phone fits in the smaller pocket perfectly. Would buy again."
4.0,purchased as a replacement for an older version of the same item; my husband likes it better than his original one.
4.0,"This necklace was perfect for gifting! The packaging it included was very cute and well put together. I loved the look of the necklace and the quote on the box. I thought the gems would be a bit bigger/stand out a tad more, but all in all I’m very satisfied with my purchase. I would buy again!"
4.0,"Comfortable, flattering fit. I am 5'3&#34; and they are just a bit too long. I will need to hem them."
4.0,"I got this to replace a pendant chain (which tend to break eventually). This is appropriately thin and good quality. Same delicate quality as you find with most large dept store quality pendant chains. Clasp feature similar - i.e. not esp sturdy, so likely to wear and/or break eventually as well ( not sure why manufacturers can't improve upon this feature)."
4.0,The gray/silver color has a blue hue to it. Not a pure silver. But none the less- it’s absolutely adorable. Everyone thought my little guy was the ring bearer of the wedding even though he was just a guest
4.0,I want tro try this style at a resonable price in case I couldn't wear one. This is very nice.
4.0,These pants are comfy highly recommend you can't go wrong .
4.0,Cute nice color
4.0,"It was really lovely though the chain broke the first time my daughter wore it. She is six so maybe she was too rough with it.<br />Otherwise, very pretty."
4.0,I would buy a size up.
4.0,"I love the color and the alpaca is soft, however it run's small!"
4.0,very nice<br /><br />your body will decide actually
4.0,"Works good, conformable. Not for a big head person tho."
4.0,"Comfortable, good fit, not sure about UV protection ."
4.0,I ordered the wrong size but they work well for what I ordered them for
4.0,"I was looking forward in ditching my bulky tungsten metal ring permanently but these rings are not the answer to do that. Wore ring during my workout and it was amazing! Forgot I was even wearing it and because it was so comfortable I just kept it on for 24 hours but I didn't like how my finger started to look. These fitness rings are not everyday rings but workout/ fitness rings. I can see why woman would want to wear these rings because we men are just dogs!!! But men, I don't know but I have an open mind.<br /><br /> I received these rings at a discounted price in exchange for an honest review of the product."
4.0,I've worn it for a few days and the material can feel a little sharp. It's advised to not sweat on the band or get it wet to retain the vibrant colors on the metal and fabric so it's unfortunate that this watch which is also used for working out ..  I have to change the band for it. Only other downside is the metal where the bit goes is really tight and seems like it almost doesn't fit.<br /><br />The colors are awesome and it's easy to put on. With the metal being tight for the but it does make it very secure so I don't worry about it coming off my wrist. I really enjoy it so far and hope it lasts a while.
4.0,"I knew this was going to be a very deep cut neck, but I was not expecting the plunge to pass my sternum. I only wear a 32C, but the amount of fabric actually covering my chest was not enough to comfortably wear the dress. The dress was a nice quality for the price and fit really well, but it just didn't have enough coverage. I wasn't able to get a bigger size because it would have made the rest of the dress too large on me. Still giving 4 stars because if I was a bit more confident, this dress would be a knock out. Definitely invest in some fabric tape if you plan to wear this!"
4.0,I have tiny wrists and most bracelets are a bit large on me but I can barely get this bracelet on. The quality and color are nice but it’s very small.
4.0,Purchase this bathing suit to wear on vacation for 3 weeks in the Caribbean. I used it to swim everyday in the ocean as well as a tool. After just a few days I noticed that the seat and was starting to be saggy unstretched. I felt very uncomfortable and had to change to another bathing suit for the rest of the time. Very disappointed I had purchased one just like it two years ago and loved it this one seems to be of inferior quality stretched out terribly. I will not buy again. What you said because I was waiting to this signs you come around again couldn't wait to buy it. Wasted my money
4.0,"I bought these gloves for a flapper costume and they worked perfectly. They were cheap and quick to deliver, and fit well. They material is soft and the gloves were long enough to look authentic for exactly what I wanted them too. Great purchase!"
4.0,Holds cards securely and also easily accessible.
4.0,I got this for my brother as a Christmas gift and the size was a bit too big but nothing huge. It had nice memory foam that feels amazing which helps my brother since he has back problems. It was a bit expensive as I could have found cheaper prices at kohls or target but I prefer online shopping. It is fluffy and cozy from both inside and out and just a great gift.
4.0,"Cute simple, little cheaper looking than pictured but for the price it was good. I personally didn't care how the bust area fit (may need to put a stitch to hold the gap closed. Other than that a nice little dress."
4.0,Very cute and provides good grip. Easy off and on but stays on feet well too
4.0,Bought this along with other P90X products for my son for Christmas.  He loves everything about it except while using the yellow band the end piece pulled out of tubing and caused tube to pop him quite hard across the stomach is there anyway for this to be fixed or replaced?
4.0,Very cute but they could've added lining to the inside.
4.0,"I loved the necklace!  I wore it to all<br />My senior year school dances (4 total) and thought it was lovely and complemented everything well. Unfornatley, for the price you get, it broke after the 4th wear."
4.0,"Exactly as pictured! Great quality, great product!"
4.0,"I like the feel of the pants<br />They also fit well, but I have no idea if it'll shrink after I wash them. Hope they don't!"
4.0,It's high quality pants. But way too short for me.
4.0,"Bought these to use as keyring.  I didn't do enough homework to realize these are very slim.  The quality is good, and they feel secure, it was my fault for not researching the appropriate diameter of what my intentions were."
4.0,"It looked fine when I finally opened the package, it soft and felt good. I ended up giving it to my best friend for her grandson. She told me that her grandson is wearing it, and it's holding up well for an active 14 month old boy."
4.0,Works grear!
4.0,"I like having something bright to put my passport in.  I'm one of those people that has to check to make sure my passport is still on me every time that I leave a place, and this helps A LOT.  It's roomy enough to hold my passport, my husband's passport, and my driver license, credit card, and a little bit of cash.  This thing has served me well!"
4.0,looks great. Quality could have been better.
4.0,"Just as expected! Arrived quickly, color and fit was as expected and enjoyed my first outing in this shirt on the Thanksgiving weekend.  Would purchase other products in this line."
4.0,"These are exquisite, but I found out from the first set I bought that the chains were quite fragile. Even so I replaced then because they look so great, but now I know to treat them with care."
4.0,Iam 5’7 185<br />And a med fit perfect a tad tight on the chest witch is a 36c<br />But very flattering!!!
4.0,This is a sturdy tote bag but after I washed and dried them there was considerable shrinking. I made sure not to dry on high heat to minimize shrinkage. That part is a bit disappointing but it was expected. If the company would make these out of prewashed canvas they would be much better.
4.0,i got a lot of nice comments on this dress
4.0,Bit small - but color is good
4.0,"Was not the exact color like the picture, it was more of a red then burgundy, but still a cute suit"
4.0,"For reference my daughter is a perfect 6. I did mistake getting exactly size 6 instead of any bigger, but she fits all other size with ease and not too much extra space but not too small at all either. These took about 15 minutes to get on in between breaks of frustration lol (I thought it was from her being 2 years old and moving a lot because she wanted to go play, or that she had to break them in in the heels) nope. The heel is altogether too small. We tried with 3 other size 5/6 toddler girls, and all of them struggled to get them on their feet. One of them has extremely thin feet too. So size up, or don't buy at all unfortunately because they are CUTE AS ALL HECK but that heel isn't properly portioned for a human. One very sad Frozen toddler on my hands until we found her a pair of Frozen shoes that fit"
4.0,"Fits perfect.  Cute compression socks, almost impossible to find!"
4.0,"Ordered another one, but went down a size. also got one for my mom as a gift. So comfortable. I wear mine to the spa or beach."
4.0,The face is so easy to read and the watch is very comfortable and easy to put on and take off.
4.0,Not too bad. A little tight. But nice fabric
4.0,"I am very happy with these sunglasses! They are made out of good, sturdy material and provide good protection to my eyes. These are a great Ray-Ban dupe for a fraction of the price! I would recommend these."
4.0,"The belt is fine, just as described. The blue I chose looks more like gray to me. I would probably get a second belt if they made in a good shade of tan or khaki."
4.0,This is the second pair of these pajama pants that I've bought for my husband.  The only complaint that I have is that they are VERY long.  My husband is 5' 7&#34; and I have to take 5&#34; off the bottom.  Once they are hemmed they fit perfectly.  Very comfortable and holds up well to a lot of wear.
4.0,"I love it! My baby was so cute on it.. the only thing that i didn't is every time i wash it, the laces of the skirt gets looses. The velcro on the bibs doesn't help neither."
4.0,Nice distressed looking band thick but not too stiff. Breaks in quickly.
4.0,"Good pedant, even if not the highest quality one. The necklace/cord is cheap, akward, small and useless. I replaced it right away, and the child enjoying being the servant of Sauron the Deciver..."
4.0,"It's great quality, but I didn't read the description properly. It's a sweat band, not a skull cap. That's my fault. I will still use it, but won't look sa cool.."
4.0,"Looks great! Very stiff, so I hope it softens up a bit."
4.0,I wish it wasn't see through but I love the length and fit. Can see myself wearing this often this summer.
4.0,I was very happy with these earrings.  They are exactly as described.  Beautiful and comfortable too.
4.0,"This pants performed as expected, the fabric is (nearly) weatherproof and the fleece liner makes it comfortable to wear.<br /><br />I wear this almost every time I take my dog out for a walk, and also for some hikes out here in Pacific Northwest.<br />I am 5'9"" (175cm), 170 lbs, and I typically wear size 32/33 jeans. The sizing is based on Asian market, and it was kind of funny to order 4XL for a guy with typical build like me. I think I can still fit in 3XL fine, but what's nice about the extra room is I can wear additional layers, which I've done many times when the temperature drop at night. I start wearing extra layer when it's lower than 42°F.<br />The weak area with any pants are typically the seams or pockets/zippered areas. I kind of expect that with any waterproof pants.<br />This one time, it rained pretty good during the walk, I wore a regular length rain jacket, but I forgot to zip up the pockets. Slowly I can feel water seeping in around the pocket area, however other parts of the pants were dry (see pics).<br /><br />Good pants for the price point ($20)."
4.0,I have gotten quite a few compliments on this watch it’s very comfortable and I love the map face.
4.0,Wore these on a 24+ hour trip from US to Bangkok to keep circulation going in my feet and legs and to prevent swelling. They worked really well. My only complaint was the band at the tops of the socks cut into my legs after being in the same spot after wearing them for most of the trip. I just folded the band over and it was fine.
4.0,"Very cute and sexy and looks classy.  But unfortunately, these were a little small on me.  Quality is not an issue though.  I think I just really made a mistake on the size I ordered.  More like a me problem not accepting I should order a size larger.  I'm more like a smedium size and I wish they make a size like that. lol"
4.0,I thoroughly enjoy putting these on and I usually end up relaxing in them with my Muck boots on after work.. pockets in all the right places too.
4.0,"I've had this as my only purse for a while now and it's only gotten one tiny scuff mark. The straps have been through hell and back and still look great! It hasn't stretched, peeled, or gotten brittle in the slightest. I'm pleasantly surprised that it looks just about as good as it did when I pulled it out of the box.<br /><br />*Update* Had this purse for nearly 2 years now and there’s just a couple of peeled up areas in the corner and on the backside. This is NOT real leather, this is PU. But I’m not changing my rating because it’s been through so much and has stayed strong considering the nature of PU."
4.0,This would have been a five however BEWARE this does not measure 55&#34; from the edge of the closed buckle to the end of the belt was just 54&#34; so if you are a big person..... On the loose side of the buckle the top section slides to catch the belt and works really well. This is every bit as good as the $30-$50 versions.
4.0,Nice stainless steel watch band. I deducted a star because it was about impossible to get it attached to the Casio dive watch I bought this for.  Ultimately I couldn't get it attached so I have a watch band with no watch.
4.0,quality great.<br />sleves too short.<br />Its small for a large but fits and makes a great base layer
4.0,"Very pretty, but heavy and not that comfortable to wear."
4.0,These a great at a great price. The only reason it's not a 5 star is because the back of the pants(waist area) are a little lower then I like.
4.0,"Bought this for my husband. He loves the design! It fits him, but he hates the sleeves because they are very wide and the armpit areas end at his midsection. Fits everywhere else, but I may have to tailor the sleeves for him a bit."
4.0,"I think I got a size 4 but it was already pretty snug on the arms. Like everyone else is saying, the brand tag is on the side and not on the back or inside which was off putting. But looks well made all in all."
4.0,I like it would buy again
4.0,This was a gift to a young grandson and he loves it
4.0,Took a little long to come but they are so cute.
4.0,It's the perfect hat.
4.0,"Might be ok with socks in winter but way too big barefoot. Both men's and women's have to be kicked off before stairs. Dangerous carrying baby up or down. Great materials and wash well, just go smaller"
4.0,I like this Cuban link chain. It's very lite and not make of heavy metal. You can pair it with many different outfits. My only issue is that the connecting chain that you hook the clasp to is very short. If a few more links were added it would be perfect and adjustable in length. It fits more like a choker so definitely measure your neck size before purchasing. I'm most likely going to visit the jelwery section at acraft store to buy some links to add. But overall it's a nice necklace.
4.0,"Very well made mask and the packaging it comes in makes a good place to store the mask when not in use.<br />I bought this to embellish with some crystals that I hot glued on, and the mask took it very well.<br />Very satisfied with the purchase."
4.0,I would give these glasses a five star rating but the eyeglass cases are too small for the glasses!  The glasses are very sturdy and have large lenses and they also come with cleaning wipes.  Nice item!
4.0,"I thought this jumpsuit was really cute, but unfortunately, it was too tight across my hips for me to feel comfortable wearing it in public. I’m 140 and ordered a medium. It fit everywhere except where it pulled in the front across my hips. I also got a large which was huge. I like the fabric and the color, but I’ll be sending this back."
4.0,I like bit for my size (m) but I keep it.
4.0,Beautiful on but had no washing instructions. I had to guess and take a chance.
4.0,"Had a weird smell to it for a while, like a chemical smell, but its good quality. The zipper feels very strong and durable. I have a MK bag and it matched the texture of the bag almost perfectly."
4.0,Love the band except there are not enough holes.  I have a small wrist so I had to make another hole.  Every other watch band I have purchased for my Apple Watch had enough.
4.0,"Colors/Styles are true to pictures. These were adorable. Washed and dried great. Decent quality, and my litte one seemed to enjoy wearing them. Only rating 4stars because there was a small hole in one of the socks. I would have sent in for a replacement, but I needed them for pictures a few days after I received. I didn't have time to swap for a new pair."
4.0,"Not a bad pair of leggings for the price. I purchased the black mesh pair, which are very cute. I have worn these while working out and they have held up OK so far. My only complaint is that they are very thin and do not do much as far as compression is concerned. Probably would not purchase another pair for working out, maybe just for looks."
4.0,These are so pretty but too heavy for earrings for me.  I've retooled one as a necklace pendent.  Will think of a use for the other.
4.0,I really liked this headband! I was looking for something fun to wear to a 1920's murder mystery party and this was perfect. It shipped in good condition with nothing bent or broken and no pieces were missing. My only comment was that it is rather heavy and difficult to place bobby pins through the thicker silver part. I pinned it up in my hair though and only had an issue with it starting to fall down after several hours wear. Overall very happy with it and will gladly wear it again.
4.0,Such a cute pin!
4.0,My niece is having a tough &#34;tween&#34; time so I purchased this bracelet for her. I loved the message and thought it to be a great reminder for her. Good quality materials and a really great gift for someone you care about.  Very happy with this purchase.
4.0,for the money...cute!
4.0,I loved the color and and design. The fine print said it was 100% cotton when I ordered it but it wasn't. I checked the original posting and it was corrected to show 55/45 cotton polyester.
4.0,The sleeves are to loose.
4.0,I like the idea about reusable. I use this everyday and I can wash them everyday. But it’s not waterproof so that’s is the downside
4.0,"I love this shoe, but wished I had ordered a size up. I am always just perfect size 8 in most shoes and this was a little too tight. Will order another pair in size 9"
4.0,The dress runs a little smaller than I expected.  Lovely dress
4.0,Linda y a la moda
4.0,I love this suite! I am going to have to make some adjustments on the top due to my girls being DDD''s however that was expected.
4.0,These glasses seem to help with night time glare
4.0,Not quite as drapey as the photo
4.0,"I love that they are a solid color and still don't look medicinal.  I love that they wash up well.  Most of all I love that they make my legs feel so good.  They would be perfect if they were a little shorter and thinner, more like trouser socks.  I will be buying more."
4.0,its really cute. it doesn't look cheap but it is. I like it a lot. good strong chain.
4.0,"Good quality and material. We haven’t tried using it yet but since it’s 3mm, hopefully it will keep my son warm. Ordered a medium and runs just a little loose on my skinny 7 yo son. He is 44 lbs 50 inches tall. Length of wet suit is perfect for him but since he is slim, it is loose on the torso. It has a nice piping in ththe edges. Overall, product is ok. This will probably last us 2-3 years. True to size"
4.0,Elastic belt loop looses it's strength after only a few used but the belt itself is great!
4.0,Love these boots! They are super cute and love the side detail.
4.0,Feels great when worn and washes well. This is a good article of clothing for a casual outing.
4.0,"To be honest, these wallets are cuter in the picture. BUT they're definitely worth what I paid. They're going to make great Christmas presents!"
4.0,6 feet 200lb. XL too big.try a large.
4.0,"Really liked the quality/ feel of the pants and flattering cut. They are really breathable for being full length which was a plus. The reason am not 100% satisfied and why I’ve given the product 4 stars is that after only 2 uses, the compression feel that I wanted has loosened, leaving a gap at the band area when I work out. I think I should have ordered a XS (which I normally never get) instead of a S, to keep the compression feel I want. Wish I had sized down."
4.0,Perfectly nice umbrella replacement but I needed one with a slit in it for my apparatus
4.0,"Nice top, sizing is on par."
4.0,These work for me. They are durable and I appreciate the hinged arms. Not very stylish but then neither am I.
4.0,"Nice fabric, good quality, but runs big. My recommendation is to buy 1 or 2 sizes smaller than regular."
4.0,"Swimdress fits ok, I order 12/14, a little hard getting on, but holds you in the right places, thought  about sizing up but didn't want the suit too loose it will stretch over time.  Looks nice on.  Also the size inside the swim dress said XL if that helps."
4.0,"These are 6"" long which should be specified instead of useless nonsense. We know what they can be used for. If you are ordering the blue color, then the color you are going to get is a teal which is shown in the 3rd picture. It will not be the color blue in the 1st two pics which shows a lighter color blue.  They also do not hang in a row like in the last 2 pictures.  They will hang as in the 4th picture with the roses closer together.  I get tired of the way you know who shows their pictures and it is not what you really get. You know what you are dealing with and I am not talking about Amazon.  I am giving it 4 stars because it is pretty and I did order other colors in the rose pink and yellow."
4.0,"The muffs are not just a brown color, but also have metallic threads accenting, giving them a nice modern look.  At first I thought they were going to have a mild Chewbacca effect, but they're more cute puppy dog. They do keep my 16-yr old daughter's ears warm, and she loves them. She says they are ""cute and 'floofy.'""  They are not adjustable, but thankfully they are the right size to cover her ears. Taking off a star for the lack of adjustability and the high price point."
4.0,I wear a size 7 and they were really tight so these are good for a 6. They are good quality though and I’ll make them stretch.
4.0,One of these fell apart soon after I put it on.
4.0,"So to start I received this product in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.<br /><br />I have this same style ring in a different brand. This brand is really comparable to the competitors. Great thing about these rings is you get 4 for the price of 1 competitors.<br /><br />I weight lift, powerlifter and am in the fire service. These rings are awesome and safe. You don't feel them on and when working out they feel comfortable. I like them for my job because of my ring gets caught on something it will just tear the ring instead of my finger!<br /><br />Only thing I've noticed is I've ordered and 11 in the other brands and an 11 with this brand. This brand seems tighter. They do tend to stretch over time but I've noticed in the time I've had these they are right on my finger. Maybe order a size larger?<br /><br />Overall a great set of rings at a great price!"
4.0,Wish it was a little longer though
4.0,the fit was very good but a little shorter than expected.  color was as advertised.
4.0,"I like these coolers because of their compactness and ability to store in my trunk without taking up much space when collapsed.  I did break one of the hinges because i was too rough pulling it out of the trunk.  Easy to fix with some bamboo skewers and some silicone glue.  This is a very effective and simple cooler that holds it coolness well when packed full.  ""Blue ice"" and dry ice are effective for longer periods of travel and storage."
4.0,"Ordered a size up and it was still almost to small. Looks just as pictured, Nice feeling fabric. Bright colors on the imaging."
4.0,Fits great it just sometimes pinches me under my arm but it's not a big.
4.0,shirt sized just right love it! i would say the only negative thing was  that shipping was too high .
4.0,"I got this snap for Christmas, I like the concept of interchangeable jewelry, but indeed the word ""Believe"" does not represent anything about the season, I rather prefer the trees stars and everything related to the season except that a word with not meaning that all."
4.0,"This is VERY form fitting! Still flattering for me though. The material is very giving so I ordered an XL and it fits more like a large, but not TOO small. The color is WAY different from the picture. I ordered pink and while it is pink it's more of a light pink than the peachy pink shown."
4.0,butt too  narrow for my hand for comfort
4.0,Interesting item to play around.
4.0,Very comfortable and pretty top. Won't hold up forever (fabric starts to pill a little after several washes) but great for casual/lounge wear.
4.0,Good quality<br />A little narrow at the temples but fit tightly
4.0,"These we very nice quality and I would have been really happy if they would have fit better.  They fit very tight around my rear, unfortunately, they didn't have a bigger size range.  I have debated returning them or seeing if they stretch after I wear them awhile. Usually I take a 1X through other women's catalogs but sizing is not equal so sometimes you get lucky and sometimes you don't.  As I said, these leggings are very nice, warm and cozy and look great.  Good buy if you can fit into them."
4.0,"At first the adjuster made it feel really tight on my finger. After a little bending of the adjuster to get it in shape, it fits much better and more comfortably. I've got my two rings on one large adjuster instead of getting two small ones for each ring."
4.0,"Loved this blouse and went on to get more in my size, but unfortunately they didn't have. It looks exactly as the picture and is quite comfortable and charming. I was guided by past purchases to buy a size up, as they fit small. GLAD that I did!"
4.0,"Besides this robe being a little to big, my father loves this robe! It's so soft and comfortable and makes him feel like a million bucks!"
4.0,The first time I ordered these I bought an extra large thinking that would be the right size for my height then wait but when I got those they were too big and they didn't fit as form-fitting as I would have liked so I returned those and bought a large. The gray pair seems bigger than the black and blue pair. Overall they're comfortable and seem like they are made of quality material. I wear leggings to work everyday as I am a janitor at a school which is always extremely warm. These seem to keep me cooler and they are definitely worth the money. I will definitely buy some more
4.0,"I like the rings a lot.  They are very nice looking and fun type style rings, but once on, they are a little thick for me to wear comfortably.  I gave them to my daughter and she has no problem with them, so it might just be me."
4.0,"The lower ""diamond"" ring pendant is very pretty and expensive looking, but the upper sing pendant and chain in general are much less impressive.<br /><br />From a distance this necklace looks great but up close, and definitely when you feel the chain you can see its not as expensive as it looks.<br /><br />Overall I still think it's very pretty and would make a cute gift, but definitely the quality you would expect for a necklace around $20."
4.0,"Super cute,  it does like like the pic, would've given 5 stars but it's just VERY thin but the print is very nice"
4.0,I'm giving this dress a 4 star only because of the color  looking a little bit  lighter  than it looks in the picture I got the burgundy color that I thought would look like the one in the picture. For the quality of the dress I can say it's great I'm just so glad I didn't have to spend 150 for a bridesmaids dress this is my second one another you're  bridesmaid dress.
4.0,love the way it fits and the feel of the material.  only issue is it faded after washing in cold water.
4.0,Fit a little tight even with cushions.  Can only wear for short period of time.  They are pretty.
4.0,looks just like the picture and works just like a pandora bracelet. great buy.
4.0,"They are great alternatives for the real thing, comfortable.... I'd prefer gold but other than that, great shipping and the product is exactly what's shown.."
4.0,Beautiful bathing suit; by now I have learned to order a larger size when ordering from China but it can be hard to guess sometimes. My advice? Order at least two sizes up. I am typically a Medium and a large was too small..needless to say I ordered an identical bathing suit from them again this time in a XL and it was a much better fit. Ordering so much bigger doesn't exactly help out your self esteem but this bathing suit was so beautiful that it was worth it! (Just rip out the size tag..lol)
4.0,cute bag .
4.0,"If you have problems breathing I would not recommend,  but does work fine."
4.0,I absolutely fell in love with this Retro skirt!<br />It arrived on time and with no hassle.<br />However it was a little bit too big.<br />My waist is a 25 so that was expected. I did some alterations and now it is perfect!
4.0,"I LOVE this top, but if you have a bigger bust/a longer torso size up. I highly recommend!"
4.0,"I recently needed more underwear and had time to really make a proper choice, but tried with reading the reviews and navigating in that way to order something in a rush. I ordered this and another one from amazon which was I think Amazon’s choice (the other popular one),that one costed 12 dollars and was cotton.<br /><br />I usually wear medium size clothes so went with medium size underwear and it fits perfectly. I am very satisfied with how it feels and looks, but I must say that they definitely do seem to have lower quality the/feel worse than the cotton ones.<br /><br />I have washed tem one time so far and they seem to not have changes at all, so in that sense its all good. The price is a bit high if I compare to the cotton ones and if I compare quality wise.<br /><br />Will update my review if any of my opinions change."
4.0,"Cute costume, well made but the arms were too short for my 12 year old who is about 5’2."
4.0,"Definitely not for use in the daytime. I did notice a small difference my ability to see things at night, which was my intent. There was also a small reduction in glare from other vehicles as well. Glasses are heavy and they feel very sturdy, definitely not cheap like they will just fall apart in a few months. They fit a little bit big on my face but still feel comfortable and snug."
4.0,"Very pretty belly button rings, but I was hoping the silver prongs around the stone wouldn’t wear away to expose the true color of the metal. Other than that they're great belly button rings, I always get a compliment when wearing the turquoise one to the beach or pool."
4.0,"I am specifically searching for 100% rayon dresses as they are great for the Texas heat. This dress's fabric was great. It's very lightweight and has a cottony feel. It's not jersey or t-shirt material, and it's not stretchy. I know from reading reviews that some people hate the rayon fabric when they get it, so be aware this is not a glossy fabric such as a polyester crepe. I'm 148lbs, 5'6"" and 38DD. I usually need a large in a wrap dress so that it actually covers up top. This dress had more fabric for the chest and fit my chest better than almost any dress. I didn't keep it because the skirt was very wide on me, flaring from the hips down. I felt like this made me look heavy in the hips. If you like a 50s silhouette, then you might like this cut of the dress. Alternately, this aspect of the fit could have been due to the dress simply being too big for my bottom half, but I needed the large to fit my top half."
4.0,"These cycling shorts are the ones I kept after orderIng a few others and returning. I wear them under my shorts and over panties. I ride an outside bike 6 times a week, when it’s not raining. It was painful, in the beginning. Now, wearing these shorts makes it less painful. Pain not completely gone but much better. I Wish they had a little thicker padding. I wear 18/20 in pants. I bought 2x. I wish they came higher on the waist. They are very comfortable, not tight on thigh, or waist. I will probably buy another pair. Oh, before I bought these I could barely ride 30 mins because of discomfort. Wearing these allow me to ride 45-55 mins. All in all, a good purchase!"
4.0,Pleased with these pants.
4.0,If you are looking for a real scorpion inside a necklace look no further. It also glows in the dark and is of good quality. The only con was the size else its exactly as pictured.
4.0,I love product but The beats are pretty lose and i keep losing this tags when I’m jumping or dancing. I lost 2 of them. I’m looking for black one again. Please let me know when it is back
4.0,"Both of them were different sizes. But good cloth, style is not good but no color came out. Good so far"
4.0,ARRIVED ON TIME AND AS DESCRIBED
4.0,"I like these, but since I wear them almost everyday, they do seem to develop holes at the toes."
4.0,"Fun and stylish floppy straw hat with wide brim. Versatile enough to wear with your best dress, or your bathing suit at the pool or on the beach.  The hat is made of flexible straw so if you if you wear &#34;big hair&#34; it will stretch just fine over any hair style. The band is strong enough to hold on with slight wind, and the brim is large enough to protect face and neck from sun. The top can be worn rounded, or creased in the middle like a fedora. The brim can also be bent up into place. Find your best style and have fun with different looks. This is definitely a five star product, but the price killed it for me. I bought a similar hat at my local &#34;superstore&#34; and paid half the price. The quality is the same."
4.0,"5’1 and 130ish before pregnancy. Bought to wear home from the hospital when we have our babe. Got a medium in case i gained a bit more but am now 7 months pregnant and its still big on me. Shirt is super cute though, and good quality material."
4.0,"These earrings are very nice, feel very solid and look great. The only complaint I have is that they so tiny on your ears. They are very unique in how they look though. Shipping was pretty good except the fact that I never got any tracking info, luckily I was home on the day the arrived."
4.0,"Extremely comfortable! I’m 5’1” at 160 lbs. and I got a large, it’s actually a little bigger than I usually like my tops but not horribly oversized. I usually hide my belly and this does just that! Will be ordering more. The only thing that I personally didn’t care for is the strings are soooo long, but I tied mine off and cut them shorter."
4.0,Fits a but loose like pj’s should. Colors are not quite as sharp as shown. My little Wonder Woman loves them just the same!
4.0,"I haven't worn a bikini in years so I was a bit skeptical about how this one would fit me. I used to be 250 pounds and now I am 165 pounds, so I have a bit of extra skin and fat left over from that time. I expected this bikini to fit very tight and to squeeze my fat until the rolls flop over unflatteringly. However, that wasn't the case. The bikini wasn't as tight as I was expecting and hid all of the spots I'm insecure about. It's cute, soft, and stretchy! I liked how this bikini fit me."
4.0,"This is an interesting concept, and I'd like it if I did dishes by hand, but because I don't do many dishes by hand, it doesn't get all that much use.  It is sort of a quick and easy solution for something like a dutch oven that shouldn't go in the dishwasher, but just getting the gloves on sort of uses up some time relative to how long it takes to actually wash said dish.  And that dutch oven is usually oily enough that I want more of a stiff scrubber.  A dish is so small and quick that I'd just use my hand and then wash my hand.<br /><br />But...maybe it would get more use should I relegate it to bathroom cleaning.  However, if I do that, there's no going back...<br /><br />Nice product, but I have not yet realized its full potential."
4.0,"To meet mask requirements and it is stylish.  It fits well.  You may consider using a darker colored fabric on the inner covering,e.g. black instead of white"
4.0,I liked the top a lot. Its really pretty and you can wear it to office too. i suggest this top to other.
4.0,"The pattern on these swim trunks are nice.  And they're long enough that you don't feel like you're wearing short shorts.  The drawstring goes all the way around, and has two pockets - one on either leg. There's no metal on these, which is nice because the local water park doesn't allow metal grommets on swim trunks if you're using a slide.  The fabric is a little on the thin side, but that just makes it quicker to dry."
4.0,Good pants. Will be good for workout
4.0,"Not completely waterproof, but otherwise very good garden gloves, definitely recommend."
4.0,Fits great! Very flattering.
4.0,these are a little snug so I would buy a size up. they are pretty stretchy & as long as I expected from other reviews/product description.
4.0,"I like the look and feel, and I'm trying to keep the amount of cargo I carry in my wallet to a minimum so this looked like a great fit for me.  Unfortunately, the credit card slots are JUST BARELY big enough to accept the cards...it's a bit of a struggle to get them in or out.  I'm hoping that, since we're talking about leather, they will loosen up with time.  I find the front-mounted ID pocket handy.  I'd give it 5 stars (maybe even 6) if it were a little easier to use right out of the box, but I live in hope that this will work itself out."
4.0,loved the shoes but they were just to small. and to tight. very narrow show and i don't have a wide foot.
4.0,works great collecting sweat before getting in eyes
4.0,kind of cheesy but my dad really loved this as a gift and wears it all the time.
4.0,"This dress totally exceeded my expectations- beautiful emrald green color and durable, thicker cotton fabric. The high waistline has built in elastic- the strings that tie in the front don't adjust the size of the waist, which was a little disappointing. I'm short, 5, 2 , and this dress is short on me- taller girls will need leggins. No brand or label, just a size tag. Super cute and fits perfectly to size. Will order again from this seller"
4.0,I love the bag!  I get Travelon bags often and appreciate the RFID pockets and anti slash.  My only complaint about this bag is the pouch is a bit small.
4.0,Good buy and versatile
4.0,"Bought these for my husband, who loves colorful socks. He says they are comfortable and cute. I've  tried them too, and I like them a lot."
4.0,Small in the shoulders but overall as described
4.0,"Cute, they are a little larger"
4.0,"It’s a cool keychain, definitely unique. The helmet does twist around and the visor came off in my pocket but overall nice product."
4.0,nice vest
4.0,"I LOVE this little black dress.  It is just perfect.  I am 5’8 so it comes above the knee but not too risqué.  The only parts that were sheer were shoulders, sleeves, and around the midsection.  Fit perfect."
4.0,It was about my expectation<br /> Thanks
4.0,Tell you the truth since I gotten these straps I haven’t used them once. I put them on my glasses but I never hang them. My glasses are on my face or on top of my head. Need to start!!
4.0,"Expect to fit i got small and is to small does not reach velcro so is not right to sixe , didn't want to go through the hasle of returning back<br />Good quality but go xtra sixe up"
4.0,"I  love this bag. It is roomy, lightweight and stylish. It holds everything from water bottle to tablet and all of the extras that you need to carry around with you. Great bargain as well."
4.0,"My boyfriends son liked it, he just turned 14 yrs old. He thought it wasa cool design."
4.0,"I really like these shorts. I bought them for a casual, all-white attire party, and I got a lot of compliments on them."
4.0,I ordered several of these in different colors/sizes and found my regular size was best. White was somewhat sheer and would require a cami underneath.
4.0,"Great shorts for the money!  I ordered medium, but the tag says US Small. That might be a good thing, as I love the fit. And love the lower front pockets."
4.0,"Size 3 (35) is big for my daughter, who is 8 and normally wears a 3. Otherwise very nice, for the price."
4.0,"Badass for not even $2. You have to cut the band to adjust it. The clasps slide right off and on through the grooves. In order to set the time, hold the button down and follow through."
4.0,Just order a size down. Its lovely
4.0,I like that it doesn't roll up however I wish it was a bit tighter. Flexible but tighter.
4.0,They are comfortable and well made.
4.0,"It fits much larger than expected. The sleeves are much wider. I suppose, it could be warn on top of a turtleneck."
4.0,"Slightly low rise, but other than that great fit!"
4.0,"The only issue I have is my grandson lost one of the cars of his clog already.  Other than that,  he loves them!"
4.0,fit and look fantastic. would recommend
4.0,"These panties are very comfortable, stretchy so movement is easy they did roll up around the thighs as the day progressed but the fabric is light so it was bareable and did not constrict circulation"
4.0,They are cute and great but u can tell there cheap but haven't broke and they work so it don't bother me
4.0,Cute little variety of my teenage niece. I think she will like them.
4.0,Great shirt! Good material. I get compliments every time I wear it out. Would have gave 5 stars but it fits a bit snug for a large and I’m on 5’9 170. Solid purchase tho.
4.0,Very pretty for the price. Just be careful where the chain connects because it can slide out easily. It has unhooked a couple times for me but never fell off my neck. Still very much worth the price..
4.0,Super hard to knot like in picture. It’s just a regular t shirt. Not even sure it’s maternity cut. Cute color though!
4.0,"I really like the top and it fits well.  However, mine came without the nice buttons on the collar.  Seemed too much trouble to return it, but for the price I would have liked the buttons.  I have gotten compliments though when I wear it."
4.0,Very nice and sexy on me.
4.0,Snug and comfortable fit.
4.0,The color is as pictured the shirt is fitted but not too tight.
4.0,Cute dress and good quality but not really meant for tall girls. I’m 5’10” and sleeves and front hem were too short.
4.0,"Love the way it fits but scared to wash it! The fabric is not great quality, it already started to pull as if it’s a yarn & I don’t think it will hold up the wash"
4.0,"I like these sunglasses, but I haven't worn them yet.  Saving for my upcoming trip and I'm sure I'll enjoy wearing them!"
4.0,"I love the material this is made of, so cool. It’s comfortable as well which is a huge plus for me."
4.0,Love the material. I wear a size 8 and after reading reviews bought a medium. Prob should have gone with a small. They don't t stay up. I bend down and they slide down. Always hiking them up. I bought a blue and black pair and have worn the blue several times. Wearing the black for the second time today and noticed that the stitching is coming out on the leg. I like the fact that can wear these as an all day pant and then to the gym in the evening.
4.0,daughter loves it and was excited that it was a functional watch as well. I would give this five stars but the battery that came with it was dead. We had to go buy a battery for $6.00.
4.0,"Comfortable fit , feel good  and controls edema but just a little heavier than expected, Good now but worry about summer time comfort."
4.0,"I still haven't decided whether to keep it or not.  It is much bigger than what I had in mind.  I know I would end up loading it up and making it too heavy for travel.  It does have lots of compartments and is plenty roomy, so it that is what you are looking for, then I think you will like it."
4.0,good replication of the stone.
4.0,I love these pants! It’s hard to find a good pair for the office that fits well and is flattering. These pants hug you in the right places. I’m 5’6 and 120lbs. I ordered the small in 32”. I would’ve been better ordering the 30” cause the 32” are a little long on me. I will be ordering another pair when I can.
4.0,"I like the size of it. Not too small, not too large. It feels accurate to the show. The box and display for it is great as well. Comes with an extra courage tag, which is nice bonus. The magnet is in the tag, and it feels like they grab the crests very well. They will stay in all day, but come off very easy. Wearing it it's pretty lightweight. The chain seems the right length it needs to be.<br /><br />My friendship crest (the one with the circle with the two side waves, for those unfamiliar with the show) didn't fit in as well as the other crests. It's slightly too tall. Also, I was a bit sad to find out the back of the tag is just the shell of the front. I was hoping for a flat back. And since everything's alloy metal, it tends to collect fingerprints easily.<br /><br />Still, I'm happy with this purchase, especially since the other sellers were selling just one crest and tag for more money."
4.0,"Soft and comfy. Light weight but not see through. Fits about a Juniors Medium, I'd say about size 4-6. The under arms are a little low, shows about 2-3 inches of bra, My daughter wears a sports bra underneath. We haven't washed it yet so we don't know how much or whether it shrinks."
4.0,These were perfect to go with a 50's costume my 6 year old daughter wore to school for the 50th day of school celebration. They are a little big but it didn't bother her
4.0,"These are very well made and pretty. The only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is they are heavier weight than I expected, but I do like them."
4.0,"The socks stay on longer, that is for sure. But my baby still gets to take them on at some point. I think, however, that it will get better when she grows a little more, as the Socks Ons will fit narrower. Overall I like them and I'm glad I bought them. I'll continue to use them."
4.0,"Lecieldoisir makes women’s garments in a variety of designs, and my wife has ordered two tops and is looking for more.  She likes the quality fabric, warm looks, and the roominess of the sweatshirts.  This LS sweatshirt with a polo shift type collar was just a bit oversized for her.  She will certainly use it when it gets cold enough outside as the top layer in a series of layered tops. The placement of the pockets, even if it is oversized for her, is perfect, and she can skip the gloves for her long walks (all bundled up)."
4.0,"These shoes are adorable and stay on little feet. The only problem is that they bleed pink dye quite heavily if they get wet. They aren’t meant for the rain so it’s not terrible, but just expect that if your little one finds a way to get her feet wet, her socks and whatever you set the shoes on will be turning pink."
4.0,Offers good traction. All in all a good pair of sandal.
4.0,Had to return because the color was not as described. But it was a very pretty dress and fit very well.
4.0,"Works great. A little hard to get used to feeling for and finding the release, but once you find it on the bottom side of buckle, it releases fine. I love the adjustability of it.<br /><br />It's no problem for me, but a couple of men have asked me if it was a military buckle from a military uniform.<br /><br />Be careful. Buckle scratches fairly easily."
4.0,"This shirt is comfortable and has held up well after several washings.  I gave four stars because the sleeves are a little too billowy, but it is still a nice everyday shirt."
4.0,Much nicer than I thought; the pictures didn't do this necklace justice! 4 star rating due to very long delivery.
4.0,"I like that the  hat has large brim, but it fits tight to wear."
4.0,The color is slightly off from what I expected.
4.0,"Love the material you can roll it in a ball pull it out and wear them.  They are long which I love, being 5’10”.  Great colors.  Definitely keeping them."
4.0,Wished it fit better!
4.0,"Very cute, little small though"
4.0,good price and stylish
4.0,"Beautiful shoes, but size ran somewhat large.  Had to return them. So sad.  Did not have next size smaller available."
4.0,Loved it.  Bought as a gift so don’t know about fit.  She loved it as well.  Hope it last and don’t fade
4.0,"Very cute. My only complaint is the green one is a very vibrant/bright color, so it’s not as depicted. I will exchange for a different color but keep the shirt. I got a S and I am 103 lbs, 5’4in"
4.0,"Arrived on time. The quality is as good as I thought it would be, nor, is the dress as long as it looks. But I love the style and color of the dress."
4.0,"Like the hat, but came crushed. had to straighten it out."
4.0,"Very comfy, a little big"
4.0,"Love the bathing suit. My boobs aren't big enough to fit the top though. 34C, bought the small, but the top would probably require a D or bigger to properly secure everything"
4.0,"I got this for my wife for anniversary day, I couldn't wait to give it to her lol so I gave it early, she loves it :) I was very impressed with it myself, it is bigger than I thought it would be and very nice looking。"
4.0,"This jacket was really cute ,although the arms were a little bit too short which makes me not want to wear it as much as I would have if the arms were longer overall this jacket is everything."
4.0,"Gloves were great. Kept hands warm. Used gloves for the snow.  The only problem with gloves is that once the gloves get wet, they take a long time to dry."
4.0,"Fits well, I was just a little disappointed that the lace around the neckline was not trimmed very well. I had to trim the straggling unfinished lace myself bc it made the blouse look cheap...it's very nice other than that."
4.0,"Petite, cute bracelet. Had it for a little over a week with no issues"
4.0,I'm 5'5 190 lbs the slow fit perfect
4.0,Better in picture. Thin material. A little large for my arms.
4.0,"Folds up nicely, keeps hair out of cloths/neck."
4.0,"I love how the dress flows and feels. However, it is somewhat see through but a slip fixed that issue for me."
4.0,Great for price! Would be a little short in the torso for someone tall but small.
4.0,"Not bad. The lock combination did get stuck, I had to break it to open my luggage... still usuable."
4.0,Decent shirts that definitely run a little small. Order a size or two up and you'll be OK.
4.0,Works great for sterling silver jewelry.  I haven't tried it for anything else.
4.0,"Purchased as a costume for school event.  Nice, but not an expensive dress so I think I got what I paid for."
4.0,I liked it a lot. The skirt is perfect for outings and everyone liked it
4.0,This works especially well if you use glasses.<br /><br />The only reason i have given 4 stars is because we cannot wash in the laundry machine as the wire that holds the bridge gets bent.
4.0,"Runs small. For perspective, I’m 6’ tall 185lbs and ordered a xxl to have extra room for a pillow belly. The outfit fits like a x large on me but i was able to fit a pillow pretty snug under the fabric,<br />The material is thin bit the price is good. I recommend this but definitely order a few sizes up."
4.0,"Love it! Very pretty in person. Quite long on me (5'4“), but good with heels. The sash would be better if it had loops to hold it up. Fit is flattering, loose and comfortable,  hides my belly very well. I am 240lbs and the 2x was just right."
4.0,"The Flase & Shade LED Patio Umbrella 11' umbrella spears to be a good buy.  I cannot speak for durability or sturdiness since I just purchased it.  I love the size though because it shades the entire table and the chairs.  At first I didn't think that the lights on the spokes and the pole had an on/off switch because the switch is usually on the pole.  This umbrella has two switches (side by side) at the end  one of the umbrella spokes. So, if you buy this umbrella - look up! Please heed the warning that states that it is important to secure the umbrella using a correctly weighted base; for this model we recommend a minimum base weight of 50 lbs."
4.0,A little bigger than a usual size 3. Daughter grew into them and wears them often. Good shoe for the price I paid.
4.0,"The slippers and mask are very cute and soft. I've been using them for a month now and I still like both of them. The mask is adjustable, but it is difficult to do so. Also, from using the slippers I can already feel them becoming this squishy, but that happens to most slippers :("
4.0,"I normally wear a large, but I used this one for cold-weather photography, and so needed a larger size. Good fit. Only problem was that the zipper doesn't go close enough to the tips of the fingers."
4.0,"Basic apron and hat, I was looking for reasonably priced sets to go with play kitchen, this isn’t anything fancy and fits the bill"
4.0,"I wanted to like this and the bra itself was nice but it was too snug. I’m 5’6” and a 34B, and the medium was uncomfortably tight, but I think the large would have been too big, so I had to return it. Others may not mind a tight fit, but be warned about how small it runs compared to traditional sizing. Check the size chart before buying. I rely on size specs from other reviewers so I hope this can help someone."
4.0,I was under the impression that the doll was included but it’s NOT. I repeat THE DOLL IS FROM YOUR OWN HOME. CUTE MATCHING ROBE SET THOUGH.
4.0,I love this grill... I told people I had rose gold melted on my teeth and they believed me! They are very delicate and tricky to fit.
4.0,Very nice a little bit bigger than expected
4.0,Seams need to be trimmed. Pinkie and index fingers are too long. Like the snugness and finish on them. With a tiny bit of work on my part these gloves are well worth the price.
4.0,"Cute and seemed like a good quality! For the price I honestly expected them to be much thinner and cheaper feeling. The only loss of one star is due to the fact that they are packaged and folded up as sets of six. So it was a bit of hassle to have to pull them apart to be placed out for a party. Other than that, I would definitely buy again!"
4.0,"Tough soles, nice material-easy to clean. Price is great for the quality."
4.0,Good fit. Wrinkles easily
4.0,loved it! my husband uses it everyday. good quality
4.0,"Love the look, size, clarity, but disappointed because they do not come with the back they show in picture.  They come with the clear rubber domes and those are not a good fit for everyone."
4.0,"Good bag for the purpose it's needed. Not something I would use everyday, but cute, functional, comfortable, and secure for use at an all day music festival. Fit my phone, wallet, tube of sunscreen, pit pass, keys, gloss, protein bar, etc."
4.0,I would get a size bigger especially for the bottoms
4.0,This dress is pretty and unique. I would say that it is a bit itchy though.
4.0,"Material is really good but size is too small for what you will be ordering. If your kid is 10 size, please order the 12 size.....Refund will cost you about $5. (16% of the cost of the t-shirt). Beside that all is great."
4.0,"Cute shoes, but the smell is so strong of like rubber. I hope it goes away with time. They are very light weight and good for my child to play outside. Good shoe for the price."
4.0,"This is too loose around the ribs, but also too small to cover my chest. im a 34 D"
4.0,Nice looking low price watch. I'll wear it for motorcycling and other fun stuff. Build quality seems solid. Black leather band is sturdy and has a good vintage look.
4.0,Very comfortable! I wear them to yoga or around the house. Fit as expected.
4.0,I bought because of the color and as gifts to a friend
4.0,"Great quality, except for the bow... it's made a very cheap fabric, seems as if it's made from a liner for dresses and a very thin one at that. I also had a hard time understanding the sizes between the one that's in the pictures and the one in the description; so  it being small for me is most likely a part of my fault for not reaching out for further assistance. Fits everywhere else nicely except in the mid section... so i decided to keep it for motivation and a goal to fit into!"
4.0,Love the shirt. But it took 2 months exactly to get it from the time I ordered it.
4.0,Get a size up if you want to be so they will fit well with 38dd
4.0,She says they are very warm
4.0,"Price is good, but quality is not as good as before, and running small compared to same medium size I ordered before for the same jacket with different color"
4.0,"They work well for travel, with only a faint amount of light leaking in from the nose (some people with a different anatomy may not have this). I have owned these for several months and started using it daily in bed. I would not recommend for use in bed if you are a wild sleeper (I sleep like a tornado) unless you have black sheets because if they fall off your head and you sleep on top of them and sweat, the color runs off the black and stains your sheets."
4.0,The fit isn't perfect with the watch but after alittle but if working with them they finally lines up. Once lined up and screwed in there is a slight gap but other than that they are sturdy don't feel like it will break or tear and very comfortable. No discomfort or issues
4.0,i love these but the backs need to be stronger. these earrings are a lil bit bigger and need a heaver back than the clear rubber ones.
4.0,I really like the watch. Looks good and keeps time well. The face is a little big but still looks nice
4.0,"These are nice, sturdy shorts. However they are rather clingy and snug, and they seem a bit revealing if ya know what I mean. I tend to kind of pull them down a bit if I go out with them to keep them as loose as possible."
4.0,"I purchased medium pairs of the long rainbow striped pants and the short double white striped pants. I love how the rainbow pair fits while the other pair fits more like leggings. I am 5'6 and 135-140 LBS, I have wide hips and a small waist and these sweats are very flattering to a more hour glass figure. However, if my waist was just an inch wider the waistband would be too tight (which could be problematic for square or apple shaped figures). In general, I suggest sizing up, especially if you want a baggy fit or if you carry more weight around your tummy rather than your butt."
4.0,"I like it, very comfy. Only problem I have with it is that the top is a lot shorter than expected, almost a crop top."
4.0,Love it !!! 🥰
4.0,"I usually wear a Small (5'5"" tall, 25"" waist). I ordered Small, and they fit like a large. I retured them for XSmall, which still fits baggier than a normal Small, especially through the calves. I push them up at the calves and they look like capri pencil slacks that are ruched at the bottom. The material is heavier than leggings, with a weave like slacks, so it doesn't look bad that they are a little loose. They are dressier than leggings, but just as comfortable."
4.0,My sister lived this necklace and wasn't even expecting it.
4.0,"This is a very pretty sweatshirt.  It is very stylish and has beautiful lace crochet detail on the side.  It fits well, as expected, and the color is a beautiful mint.  I only give it four stars because it would be a little difficult to wear in any colder weather - my arms were kind of cold, but that is to be expected when they are largely exposed."
4.0,It's blue. It doesn't scratch easily. It spins nicely. Only downside is that 1% of the time it squeaks in a high pitch. Will try WD-40 on it.
4.0,"Would have given this 5 stars if the pins had been longer.  The pins that came with the band were slightly shorter than the pins in the original Fitbit Blaze strap.  Using the pins that came with this band, I could not get the band to stay attached.  However, when I took the pins from the original strap and used them instead, the band stayed firmly attached.  I love the look of the band, and I love the magnetic closure."
4.0,"Works great for the price. Only dropping one star because of the false rfid blocking claim. To everyone out there, this is never true! I don't understand how companies get away with this. The wallet would have to be a completely enclosed Faraday cage."
4.0,"The material of these leggings was a bit different than expected, they're a cotton feel but they almost have a bit of a coating to them. I suspect the coating will break down with a few washes though. The band is seamless and comfortable, mid rise. I'm 5'7"" 125lbs and a small fit fine although the ankles are quite loose.<br /><br />This is more of a lounge type legging than working out since this would definitely show sweat."
4.0,"Good value for the price and soft to the touch, but I found the cut to be a little boxy and matronly on me (5'3"", 135lb, 34A). It's basically cut straight and not tapered in at the waist. Fine if you don't mind that, but I ended up returning this and spending the extra $10 on the Columbia Tamiami shirt."
4.0,Fits perfectly.  Looks as nice as a name brand jogging. Loved it.
4.0,Nice hat.  Fits me well and I like the pattern a lot.
4.0,They  were  to small  because I was to  big  i love  the  Bright colors  i was very  sad when  they  didn't  fite
4.0,It's quite nice even though the ribbon does come out quite easily it's very nice for the price
4.0,Both shirts wear well. They fit good. Color was not exactly what i thought but still very nice
4.0,adorable.  best to buy .5 size smaller as they run a bit large
4.0,"Great quality! Fit perfectly. LED rgb was nice touch. Motion sensored btw. Would be ultimate swrater if back had reindeer back, ass, and tail. 😁"
4.0,"These were a great price and my boys just loved them and had fun with these with their friends,"
4.0,"I love this cap, the material is smooth and silky, and comfy. But the elastic was most likely sewn in the cap rather quickly, because part of it is sewn to the cap, rather than the elastic casing, so I can't tighten it properly. I'm going to have to take out some of the stitches to allow the elastic to do its job, and sew up the casing again. A bit of a nuisance, but otherwise the cap is very cute!"
4.0,"This was purchased as a gift. Seem well made. They are not a thin glove, so will be warm. Dressy enough for date night, yet casual enough for every day use."
4.0,"Nice, still haven't worn."
4.0,Good price but some stitching is sub-par. Quick disconnect is a benefit.
4.0,"I've used this glove for over a year now in a bunch of roles. It's a solid performer overall. Here is some of my notes:<br />-durable material<br />-affordable price<br />-affordable to manipulate (writing, loading)<br />-heat resistant, can melt the outside materials<br />-only good for 30+ degree weather"
4.0,Love the color!  Love the style!!  But it is just too small!
4.0,Fits well but top is thin
4.0,Think they were miss sized. Previous purchase of polo sweats were comfortably lose. These are almost double in size.
4.0,These are absolutely adorable. The little girl I bought them for loved them. They run a little small. Don’t let the outside size fool you.
4.0,They are okay for thexample money.
4.0,"I love this purse, it just doesn't hold very much."
4.0,I really like this coat. It's nice and light. Only this is I am tall and the sleeves are a little short for my liking. Other wise great coat.
4.0,"I love the shirt pattern and material.  I ordered a size smaller and it is still too large.  Not much of a problem for me, since I can easily sew a tuck in the side seams, and I would rather have it too large than too small."
4.0,"Materials seem cheap and light, these shorts might be the lightest I own. They seem cheap, from the zipper to the fake out button clip. They will wear out quicker than other brands with better zippers and buttons. But thus far these shorts have served admirably. Suprising as I've had crashes in these shorts and they are yet to rip or tear. After 10 or so rides I'm pretty happy. And the chamois that comes with was surprisingly comfortable. I got these winding what the lower priced riding shorts had to offer and I was pleasantly suprised."
4.0,"Bag was nicely constructed, just didn't like that it felt very stiff and hard to get into. Had to return it due to that. Also it looked more squared than I thought it would be. Other than that, it was a very pretty bag."
4.0,"I love the shirt, just not the fit. After reading reviews I ordered one size larger and assumed it would also shrink some with a wash and dry. It did shrink some but is still pretty big."
4.0,"This skirt is so cute and the cut is extremely flattering. I was a little nervous with it not having any reviews, but I’m glad I took the risk. I only gave it 4 stars because there is no hole for either string to go through so it just wraps and then peeps out on top, but it looks fine.<br />I’m 5ft 7 with a 28in waist and was able to have the wrap start from one side of my waist, go around the back, go past the start point and end on my other hip. The length goes just past my knees almost mid calf.<br />I can’t wait to make this a staple of my wardrobe this summer!"
4.0,"Well, I'm catholic, but I still enjoy these talismans and such, even if they don't work, they're still fun to collect and such.<br /><br />Anyways, The only complaint I really have is that the necklace does not come tied together, it would be really cool if it had the sliding adjustment knots, but luckily those are easy to tie.<br /><br />Anyways, I still love this necklace, and the best part is that it is made in the USA. which is the best part for me.<br /><br />I WILL recommend this product to others."
4.0,Purchased this shirt last minute for a concert I was attending. The material is great and very breathable. Very happy with this purchase. The shirt for very well I'm a smaller woman with a small bust. Great buy!
4.0,"I like the shirt, however it’s actually different than the sellers photo. Not army green. And the straps are a little bigger than photo. I still wear it and i am happy with the purchase"
4.0,"They are great, i don't give 5 star because the zipper on the poket broke the first time I used it  ."
4.0,"Fits slightly large, size down for a more fitted look. Was pleasantly surprised with it! Bought  one for each of my girls and was concerned it may be slightly see through but it wasn’t. It’s definitely a lighter fabric but couldn’t see their undergarments or skin through it. Nice stretchy tee!"
4.0,"Great dress, looks like material will snag easily. I didn't realize it was pink until I received it, was hoping it was white but I kept it."
4.0,"Love this skirt. It is a bit see through. I ordered a large in the apricot color. It is long enough for me (I’m 5’11). It did run just a tad big. I had room in the waist but I don’t like my skirts super tight, so if you do order a size down!"
4.0,Super cute dress that fits great on bust however the dress is super short for my height.  Luckily I have a relative that the dress fits perfect on!  Material is light weight with a flutter sleeve that falls about mid way on the arm.
4.0,Other than just a little small nice shirt. Quick delivery.
4.0,"Teal: fit as expected but really thin material<br />Beige plaid: slightly smaller than the teal but I preferred the thicker/stiffer fabric<br /><br />I ordered this dress in two different prints (the beige plaid and teal) both in an XL. Unfortunately, I had to return both. The teal was true to size and the material was really soft and stretchy. While comfortable, it was really thin and not as structured as I had hoped (with how obvious the outline of my bra was, I would have wanted an undershirt). The plaid material was different. It was still soft but much stiffer (and a bit thicker) than the teal, and it did not have much stretch. I also felt like it was about a half size smaller than the teal, and while it fit, it was a bit on the snug side. If it had fit just a little looser, I would have loved the plaid version of this dress (it had the structure the teal did not). Also the beige color is light enough, you'll want to make sure you're wearing nude-colored undergarments or an undershirt or slip of some kind."
4.0,~Very pretty and nice for the price)..THANK YOU!!
4.0,"Beautiful, comfortable and well designed. Only 4 stars because some of the leaves and flowers did fall off, but even with that it looked beautiful"
4.0,I struggle with sizing on bikini style swimsuits. I have a body type where my top is smaller than my bottom. This swimsuit top was wonderful. The material is soft and well made. However the bottom would prob fit a teen more so than a woman. It sits lower on the stomach than I thought. I was hoping the cut was more around the stomach.
4.0,Very cute slippers.
4.0,"The fabric is great. It's super comfortable. I purchased it when I was 7 months pregnant and I've worn it throughout my pregnancy. It will be a tad big and long afterward, but I'm sure I'll be able to wear it after also."
4.0,A little snug but will stretch
4.0,"Interesting construction. It's definitely a statement piece, so wearing this with a plain top is best."
4.0,"I bought a pair of these to go with my Halloween costume and I was super impressed with how well they stayed up! The silicone is very sticky and they stayed in place all night. They are well-made and pretty thick... The bows on the back are SO sexy (everyone loved them)! Unfortunately, the pair I got had a run in the bottom on the foot when I received them and I needed them that same day for the party. So I didn't have time to return and ended up wearing them anyway. 💁 I had to put a little nail polish around the run and tuck it down in my heels. They held up through the party but when I got home and took them off, the run had gotten pretty bad and I had to toss them. But I'll definitely be ordering another pair! So comfortable, so sexy and I love that they don't roll down! You definitely want a pair - trust me! 👍"
4.0,really great plugs! not waterproof though!
4.0,Great price and cute.
4.0,I really like this top. I usually wear and large. I ordered a large and was happy with the fit. My bust is a 36D. I subtracted a star because I was expecting a blouse but the top is made of t-shirt material. The material dresses it down a bit for me; but I would still probably wear it to work.
4.0,A wedding but the color is more purple then blue
4.0,"I wasn’t expecting this to actually do much, but it’s turned out to be very effective! The shock isn’t harmful, but it definitely gets your attention. I was having trouble hearing my alarms in the morning, but this will get you up for sure! It’s also very easy to set up with their app. This is an overall great product."
4.0,Not particularly durable feeling but pretty and will make a nice cover up.
4.0,Love my new kitty purse!
4.0,I liked how they felt but they seemed pretty cropped
4.0,I’m 5’3 & weigh at 140lbs...ordered a small. Fit was great and I liked where it sat on the waist. I just couldn’t give a 5 star bc there was no lower stomach compression. I have loose skin from weight loss and I like my leggings to compress and it just did not do that enough for me. Loved everything else about them.
4.0,Four stars for now.. haven't used it yet. But the workmanship seems solid.
4.0,I purchased these as a grift for a family member just for fun and he really likes them.  Says the Superman ones make his feet want to fly!  Hahahaha
4.0,"I like this dress. It is comfortable, with pockets, and fits nicely. A little thinner material than I had expected but doesn't have a negative impact. Great for the price."
4.0,"Nice quality footwear for my grandson, but a little small inside and this makes them difficult to put on and keep on his feet."
4.0,"I really liked the print and shape, but unfortunately I was too chesty and the fabric did not have any give in it.  It may be perfect on a smaller chested person."
4.0,I wish I would have ordered a smaller size...
4.0,The shoes fit true to size to me. I didn’t realize they were fabric but my daughter loves them. The yellow is also darker than I expected but they are really cute!
4.0,I bought this for my best friends husband. They loved it! He can fit all his cooking utensils and his beer in the front lol
4.0,"Was a Gift, looks good, i do not know how efficient it will be?"
4.0,Material was just a little thinner than I was expecting
4.0,they squeeze their ends good
4.0,My grand son loved it
4.0,"I usually take a small, but these are quite tight. Cute though - as my boyfriend is a big batman fan."
4.0,"Very confortable, nice for casual wear"
4.0,i love how soft it is. but it was a bit too large. my hips are 38 so i bought med. so i guess next time i would buy sml. but for sure i would definitely buy again
4.0,NICE DRESS JUST DIDNT WORK FOR MY OCCASION SORRY HAD TO RETURN
4.0,"This is not a heavy jacket. I'm 5'8"" and 170 lbs, ordered Medium it fits perfectly, sleeves a little long but would fit a taller person as well because of the longer sleeves. This is a good foul weather windy rainy day jacket. This is an upgrade from a simple wind breaker but it is not a heavy winter jacket, would work in colder weather as an outer layer. Overall I am happy with this jacket"
4.0,"Most my tops are just a large in size, so I ordered an XL thinking it would fit and it's a bit snug.  It is also hard to get in and out of, but once it is on it looks fine.  Nice fabric, pretty thick.  I would say the hemline is three inches above the knee."
4.0,It's very fashionable and nice with any outfit.  It hasn't changed colors.  I like the different looks to the bracelet.
4.0,"I found Dezzal last December and I've been a huge fan of their floral dresses. I've seen them increase in quality over time and I'm excited to see how they continue to develop their product line. I'm 5'2&#34;, usually wear a 0/2, 30-32A and around 110lbs. This size fit me tightly (the slip and at the shoulders, the waist had some room). The dress itself hit around my ankles, while the slip hit about mid-thigh.<br /><br />Loves: The color of this dress is absolutely beautiful. While I took photos I had an elderly woman come up to me and ask me if it was a wedding gown, it is legitimately that gorgeous in person. I love that the sleeves are 3/4 (perfect length for this kind of dress) and the slip is made of a material that feels soft and glorious (I wish I could wear the slip as it's own dress, in the past the slips have either been sewn in or are a body con kind of camisole, this one is like a delicate dress or nightgown all on its own). The slip also color-matches the dress exactly, which gives a beautiful effect. This dress is perfect for anyone who wants to feel like a bohemian/fairy princess/bride. With the appliqu&eacute; it makes it look like you're just wearing a gown of flowers.<br /><br />Eh's: This dress departed from the &#34;embroidered on lace&#34; look and combined the appliqu&eacute; with the lace, so the flowers are sewn on only in the centers. This means that sometimes the placement of the flowers can be a little inconvenient (like right over the zipper, I needed a little help zipping it up without getting the flowers caught). Also, while I love, love, the material on the slip, something about the stitching and/or cut of it was inconsistent (which is why I can't wear it on its own) so it hangs a little &#34;off&#34;. It wasn't enough to look weird under the embroidery, but it's noticeable on its own (pictures included). This probably isn't true of all of their slips, I might have just gotten an awkward cut."
4.0,They run a little bit small
4.0,"Not the best quality product, the stitching is horrendous around the thumbs.  But fingerless gloves like this are not that easy to find, particularly the ones that have one big opening for all your fingers as opposed to individual spaces for each of your fingers.  I was looking for a pair of gloves that was made of thin material and stayed closer to my wrists (as opposed to going up toward the elbow) and this one fit the bill.  While the price was right, I'm not sure how long this product will last....but I'm certain the crazy stitching will unravel in the not too distant future.<br /><br />If these were a little better made, slightly shorter and made of some nice thin wool, they'd be absolutely awesome."
4.0,Very nice heavy quaility fabric sewn well. Cute bright print. Nice cut. Very cheeky and very low cut in the front (make sure you shave waaay down) Lol. Runs small. I normally wear a large or womens size 8. These are very snug. An extra large would have been better.
4.0,Nice bag. Decent quality for the price
4.0,"Arrived within two days as promised/guaranteed.  Beautiful dress, but very tight around the empire waist.  Will have to return."
4.0,"It’s still cute but it’s almost an empire waist which is not slimming.  And I do not have a long torso, very average"
4.0,The color is perfect and it fit my daughter wonderfully. We ordered a large which looked big until she had it on. She is normally a junior size 9 or 11. The collar is made of lace. We are using it for an Alice in Wonderland cosplay. The skirt was much longer than expected. The material will need ironing before wearing.
4.0,True to size. Very comfortable. Easy to walk in.
4.0,"I purchased the size 12-14. I am 5ft4 and 160lbs. My bottom half is between a US 12-14 and my chest is 36D -34DD. My stomach doesn't completely match the sizes of my bottom and top so the swim suit is a little loose in that area, but it is very comfortable and I am very pleased. I do think there will be a few spots I will need to reinforce stitches  but no biggie!"
4.0,I couldn't believe how pretty these are! Especially for the price! Excellent price and quality!
4.0,"I was a little surprised by the anticipated ship date being over a month.  However, this product comes from China and I actually got it within two weeks.  The quality is good.  Only complaint is that it is a little difficult to adjust the size.  Otherwise very happy with this product."
4.0,She loved it  I thought size ran big but she said thats how she wanted it
4.0,The glasses are little bit big for my face i prefer them to be smaller
4.0,"Amazon had to replace our first mask, the one eye didn't light as well. The 2nd mask was fabulous and very creepy.<br /><br />Just remember to add batteries"
4.0,"Good for mild winter in Ottawa, Canada"
4.0,Fit as expected..nice maternity dress.
4.0,"This sweater is cute and comfortable. It fit well and the material is really soft. It is a slight, small turtleneck, which is slightly uncomfortable to me, but I absolutely love the burnt orange color! It's not super thick and perfect for a warm fall day!"
4.0,"It’s tightly knitted so it’s nice and warm. Fabrication is thick and not as stretchy as expected, but I still love it. The design is so adorable."
4.0,Socks are cute & seem to wear ok as long as washed in cold water inside lingerie bag & hung to dry. Lace won't last otherwise. Granddaughter loves these frilly ankle socks!
4.0,Arrived very wrinkled. Let it hang for a week but stayed wrinkled. Had to use my steam machine to get it smooth. Hangs nicely but really thin fabric for a winter dress. Feels like a comfy nightgown. Wore it on Christmas day with a blingy necklace. Beautiful color that I would describe as emerald green
4.0,It’s comfortable but the elastic  around the arm is a little annoying . I’d prefer just regular short sleeve but looks cute
4.0,The slippers fit true to size. Quality made product. They are not for any type of rapid movement. Great relaxing fit.
4.0,Super soft leggings. I had to buy another pack. A touch see through but not super noticable. New favorites
4.0,Good---would give 5 stars if made in the USA!
4.0,"I thought this would be more of a cotton material, but it is definitely a polyester, stretchy material. You can see your nipples through the top."
4.0,"These are a must have for long flights!  After suffering with swollen feet and legs during a vacation, someone recommended compression socks.  I purchased these for my next trip and put them on for a 16 hour flight. No swollen legs or feet!"
4.0,"I really like this shirt, it is very comfortable, but xxl is somewhat big, I think xl would of been fine, but ordering online when you can’t try it on ya never know."
4.0,Cute and little one loves it!
4.0,The earrings are cute and affordable
4.0,This is a fun little trinket to give as a gift. I bought some for my traveling buddies. They made a great Christmas gift. Item is exactly as described.
4.0,"It's very cute, but small, so made more for a child than an adult.  My sister wore it and it fit fine, but the tail is short and ears small for an adult."
4.0,"Other reviews aren't kidding when they say this runs small. I'm 5'5&#34;, 120lbs and am usually a 2/4 in size but I ordered a medium 8/10 due to other reviews and that is pretty snug on me. I actually just ordered a large to see if it's more comfortable and if so I'll return the medium. Otherwise the costume looks great! Like others have said the accessories are pretty cheap. Boot covers are for heeled shoes and the tactical belt is cheap and flimsy so I scrapped them. Picked up a swat belt and thigh holster on Amazon to complete the look. The gloves that come with the costume aren't the best either, but they'll do in a pinch if you don't want to spend the money to get another better pair."
4.0,A little stiff out of the package but it fits great.
4.0,Love the extended sized. I like my pjs to be nice and baggy which is hard to find when you are already a plus size. I do wish the fabric was softer to the touch.
4.0,Comfortable fit for a flip flop. The part between the toes is ribbon material - not sure if this will hold up but for now I really like them.
4.0,It was a gift for someone going to Italy she liked it alot
4.0,Great color/design. Just run a little small. The stitching around the waist has already started to fray and come apart.
4.0,It is pretty but not dainty.  I like that it holds four small pictures.
4.0,"Just a little big and didn't stay in , had to squeeze it together to fit in my voice and stay for the day"
4.0,Which it was as Shiny as the Pictures.
4.0,This is beautiful and comfortable.  I am large on the chest (34f) so it comes down to just under my breasts and then makes the transition to the skirt.  I wish the top part was a little longer.  It is a nice soft fabric and very comfortable to wear.  It has a good amount of stretch and the colors are true to the picture.  It comes down to my ankle.
4.0,"Purchased for my 7 year old boy, they fit snug. Smaller than expected"
4.0,Love these affordable boots. Very fast shipping! Only reason I gave them a 4 star rating is because they seem to be a while size small. I ordered a 8 (I'm usually a 7.5-8) and they were much too small. Sold them to family member that is a size 7 and they fit her good. I reordered a 9 and they fit me. So both of us have the size bigger than we usually are in other shoes/boots. Otherwise great!
4.0,"Bought it for my grand daughter in VA. When they received it. It's cute, but it runs big."
4.0,"Really cute pattern. The material is like a fleece blanket so it'll be really nice for fall and winter. Only downside is the sleeves are a little long for me (I'm 4'11""). I can roll them up, but it would be nice not to have to roll sleeves up for every pullover. Still cute!"
4.0,"I am 34B wear size m. And it fits as expected. I like the zipper design, very easy to put on."
4.0,"I bought the robe for my girlfriend. It is super soft and plush. I am very pleased with the size and fit. It has 2 belt loops stacked on top of one another, so the belt level and be customized. My only complaint is my disappointment in the color. I was expecting it to be bright pink as pictured. It is much more muted and pale purplish in color.  She loves it, though, so i guess that's what counts."
4.0,"As the size is easily adjusted, it fits. The stone has lots of sparkle & catches the light. The setting of the stones is a little crooked, which is a little disappointing, but it is just a bit of sparkle which is fun to wear. Comfortable ring too. It is nice for inexpensive jewelry ($12.99 at time of review). I really like the setting & think it’s a nice ring. I just hope the stones don’t fall out, will update if they do."
4.0,"I had to super glue the strap back to the watch face. Otherwise I live it. Perfect size for my small wrist, I don't have to punch any holes in it, and I live the color."
4.0,"I'm on the shorter side, so I expected them to be more like ankle length rather than capris. My only issue is that it's a bit gapey on the bottom, but that's not an issue with the pants themselves, although I have a pair from old navy that are also &#34;capri&#34; length and they don't do that.<br /><br />The color is also off from the picture, that's what the star deduction is for. It's basically blue, rather than a green."
4.0,I just tried on the dress and it was a nice fit although it's a little bit long. I like that it has pockets and the material stretches.
4.0,"This is a great suit that hides figure flaws and is comfortable but it runs 2 sizes small in the hips. Make sure you follow measurements on sizing chart or go to the Longitude website to check sizing. Very good quality, however more support is needed for those with D-cup breasts. Would be better if the straps were wider so they could help to support the load. Over the years I have found nearly all bathing suits lack proper support and have resorted to wearing a separate underwire bra….works like a charm. The colors are beautiful in this suit and so wished it would have worked. Alas, had to return it."
4.0,"Not as sweater-y looking as I thought it looked in pic, more polyester, but it’s cute!"
4.0,"This is a great buy, and a great watch.  Easy to program, the easy to read dial makes it fast and easy to read both time and the date day or night."
4.0,This purse is perfect for a gal that is 6 feet tall. The crossbody strap at it's shortest adjustment had the purse below my knees. I am 5'2&#34;. I returned and got the identical purse without the crossbody strap and it is perfect. The color is grayer versus the muted pink as shown.
4.0,"Tried to buy the small for a kid..Ran a bit big,but he will grow into it. Nice shirt,material"
4.0,"These sandals are pretty comfy.  My only complaint is the top ankle strap on the left sandal sits a bit too high and feels a bit funny when I walk.  Other than that, the sandal is great!"
4.0,There are no tags on this hat so you can place it at any angle on your head that you please without any weird patches showing. I like the overall style. I wish it held just a bit more shape to it on its own though.
4.0,for my pet....needed to be a little shorted....one pet has short legs...…...lol
4.0,"A lil smaller than I'd like to, but the quality its good,and they look really stylish"
4.0,"This is a cute hat that is also classy and fun to wear. It is made of a thick, stiff felt brim with a softer felt top. There is a velvet trim bow that is not attached, which makes it easy to adjust how/where you want to wear the bow. You can also change this velvet band out for other bands of your choice to add some color or to match a particular outfit. I like the versatility of this hat. It's a decent quality and affordable hat that makes it easy to add some personality to your wardrobe."
4.0,"They were too big, I had to order some for kids. My husband loves them"
4.0,Great for office and occasion.
4.0,"Definitely works as intended. I do see what other reviewers mean by too much flexibility where the Up MOVE actually sits. I have been wearing my band for about a week- all day at the office, during the gym, and sleeping, and I haven't had any issues but I am SUPER conscious of the band because I don't want to lose my tracker. The watch clasp is great and has a little slider piece to tuck the excess strap in against the wrist so it's not catching on things."
4.0,Mi hijo los siente muy comodos!!!
4.0,The only thing I was not completely satisfied with is the color. The photo has it as a bright deep pink but it is really dull but other than that it fit exactly as I had expected it too.
4.0,For about $1 each how can you complain? I purchased an expensive anklet that I had to return because it was too small. I liked that these had more flexibility to the sizing. Some look very flimsy but again for the price I’m satisfied. Good mix of designs.
4.0,Not see through when you actually do yoga.
4.0,"Love my hoops. can't wear them to work, but everywhere else, they are banging!!"
4.0,"Bought this intended as a lightweight raincoat. Well, it’s fleeced lined, so it’s gonna end up being more of a late fall, early winter coat down here in Florida. But I’m happy with it. I just had to buy a lightweight raincoat on top of this. But I will be ordering one for other child soon."
4.0,"Nice dress, basically as expected except it was shorter than I thought it would be.  Well above the knee, definitely a short dress."
4.0,Toe area seems a little too loose
4.0,Just a little on  the small size would order up one size
4.0,"It was a small, no extra small available. Had to have it hemmed."
4.0,"Arms are a tiny bit too short, but it’s still workable. This was a hit at the Grease movie sing along my family attended."
4.0,This robe is well made and good quality fabric. I think the way it was sized being L/XL attempts to fit too much in the sizing. I needed plain XL and was in hopes it was more sized for XL and it seemed more plain large. If you need a large it is a great deal.
4.0,"For $11, these are great. I got the basic black and red model, and they don't leak. They do fog up once in a while (so I subtracted 1 star), but I don't care as long as they don't leak. The gasket around the eyes really does the trick and fits me perfectly."
4.0,Just &#34;ok.&#34;
4.0,A bit bigger than expected but nice.
4.0,"The sunglasses are great, but the plastic ear pieces can come off."
4.0,"somewhat difficult to open because its so dang small, and my efforts caused me to bend it a little :(  any slight bend makes the earring difficult to open/close.  my husband did a little surgery with some needle nose pliers to make sure everything lined up and it now snaps open/close without issue.  The earring functions so well, doesnt get caught; i dont have to worry about seams.<br />4 stars only because you will probably need a supplemental tool to get the smaller sizes opened"
4.0,"Sleeping, of course.?it’s a nightgown!"
4.0,"Very pretty and sparkly. Looks great. It is a little smaller than I thought it would be compared to the picture, but I still love it."
4.0,"The purse has served it's purpose.  I wanted something tiny, lightweight and something that can still hold my phone.  The clasps that hold the strap to the purse is a little cheap and I was afraid they would break but I wore it at a concert and several times since then and it's still holding up.  It is super cute I have to say and I was able to text with my phone inside.  That was a bonus :)"
4.0,So cute! We rocked the Pride parade.
4.0,"It's very nice, but sheer- needs an undershirt.  I went a size up and it's loose fitting.  A little  too loose."
4.0,"Dress is beautiful and comfy. I ordered a large in hopes that the length would be long enough. I am 5ft 8 in, athletic build and the length is perfect, but the width is a little large. And i feel like the thread work isn't done well/they rushed their work. I would suggest go up one size. Not 2!"
4.0,i dont like how it fits for the back pack ...way to high..strange fit... besides that i like it
4.0,"Very cute, fits as expected, and the picture is a good representation of it. The undies were slightly tight but not too tight that they weren't uncomfortable, if they were a bit looser they'd be perfect. I ordered size medium, and I am 5'3 and 125 pounds and it fit good! I am also 34B and the top fit good as well. Slightly cheap feel to this set but hey not a bad price if it fits!"
4.0,Bought it for my daughter a size Small and fit perfect.
4.0,"It' a comfortable, good looking sweatshirt that is also durable."
4.0,seem alittle wider than normal coach sunglasses
4.0,Comfortable and sizing is correct.
4.0,Love this dress. It has just the right amount of peek-a-boo to be sexy but still enough to cover my tummy. I’m 5’11” and 189lbs - the dress is not quite as free flowing as it appears in the pictures but it still has a good fit and is long enough to reach the top of my feet. I wish I could order it in every color.
4.0,love it just perfect for my gown!!!
4.0,"I use this for work and anytime I go out. The product works well enough, although I think I would've preferred the 4 separate bands rather than the y-shaped ones. I gave this a 4/5 because it feels uncomfortable where attached to the sock and rubs irritatingly against my skin. Sans the discomfort I'd recommend this product."
4.0,"The elastic on this stayed well until I washed the cap and I washed it by hand. After washing it, it seemed a little stretched out but it was nothing that I couldn't deal with. I have a cat who likes to lick my hair when I am asleep so this works well."
4.0,ok quality for price
4.0,great color and fit.
4.0,"I purchased the costume for a fundraising event. The theme being Super Mario Cart, the costume was PERFECT! The costume ONLY included the vest. The person wearing vest is 5'10"" 200lbs and normally wears an 1X.  The vest stopped at the waist. The hat was purchased seperately from another vendor."
4.0,"Though bag is small, still good for small notebook for kids."
4.0,"Rings look very nice. Fit well and are decently comfortable. The problem I had with them is the 2 piece design. When using your hands a lot and doing work the pieces will seperate and before you know it, it looks like you are wearing 2 rings.  Other than this, it's a very nice product for the money and if you are looking for a casual silicone ring this one will work well for you."
4.0,Looked beautiful. I mean quality is what u pay for but still pretty
4.0,I absolutely loved these. Only reason I returned them is because the strap is to small to go around a helmet
4.0,Great work out sleeveless hoodie
4.0,I'm glad I ordered a size up.  They fit a little snug.  Great quality....and really cute style.
4.0,This is a nice hat but I wish it was a little bit bigger for people who has full hair.
4.0,"I little bigger than I expected,but cute earrings."
4.0,"This is a great glove.  I bought it for my 11 year old daughter for her school talent show.  It was big on her so I found a white cotton glove which I then took this glove apart and sewed it to the cotton one.  I believe it is made for a mans hand but it is a quality product.  The rhinestones are great and none have come off.  It is not a cheesy, cheaply made product.  Overall, I was pleased with it."
4.0,It was to large. If the event wasn't that weekend I would have exchanged for a dress two sizes smaller. Very cute!
4.0,More for the look not for comfort. They slide off easily
4.0,Hard to put on child’s foot
4.0,It is a classic Casio. The band will probably not last very long. You can tell the plastic buckle and strap are.not that good. But the price was great. Under $10.
4.0,good value/price
4.0,Very useful if you only need readers or computer glasses.
4.0,"Used these on the bottom of a storage box. So far they working great.  Some of the adhesive pads don't look like they are sticking very well, but so far they are staying put."
4.0,"Nice colors. Didn't realize it til I got it, but it seems to be geared towards the Alabama Crimson Tide... I noticed the 'A' on both the inner and outer sides of the beanie after I got it. Not a problem tho. It still goes good with an outfit i already had. Not an Alabama outfit, but the same exact colors. How cool is that? Great purchase!"
4.0,Very nice bracelet. I really liked the fact that it was flat and felt good on my wrist. Seems to stay tightened when you tighten it to your wrist.
4.0,"If u just want to carry your phone, some charge cards, cash it’s ok but I haven’t tried putting my glasses in it yet but I think my small cheaters will fit also. It’s kind of stiff but it works for me. I’m happy with it. Just know you can’t pack a lot in it."
4.0,"I bought this bra (if you can call it that) to wear with a halter top dress.  I haven't worn it yet to the event but I tried it on.  I have very small breasts (less than an A cup), and this in size A fits well but it's not very supportive.  I think it will work well for what I bought it for but I wouldn't wear it unless I have to."
4.0,"This is not the same type of strap as the Zenwatch 2 uses, but its the only one I found. It seem to wiggle still and those pins are nigh impossible to put in when you first install it"
4.0,"I purchased this tank in an XS for my 11 year old daughter. She is 5ft, 75lbs and wears a 10/12 in girls clothing.<br />The tank hits right below her hips and is very form fitting.<br />So, with that information, I suggest on sizing up- especially if you have anything over an A cup ."
4.0,"Gorgeous dress, other than the wrinkles from packaging. I've tried to get the wrinkles out, but have had no success."
4.0,"Very colorful. Everyone comments on my Fitbit bands. Loved that I got a variety of bands. One thing that disappoints is the nub on the pastel band that determines the size, the color rubbed off.  But that was just recently and I have been wearing it daily for 5 months. The paws is adorable!  But with anything white, it gets ""dirty"" looking.  But if you didn't know how white it was when I got it, it still is very cute."
4.0,They are nice and easy to open but... I ordered the 8MM and I can not put it on because they are too thick for the hole in my nose. I tried to go in and see if I could but it hurts a lot and I definitely think that it's not for a regular nose hole. 😕😟
4.0,They are a copy of the origianal UGG but they sure look nice. love the price even better.
4.0,girlfriend liked the design.<br /><br />looks nice and fit was pretty good.<br /><br />you get what you pay for but not too shabby
4.0,This sweater was a pleasant surprise.  I have not purchased many personal clothing items online but am pleased to say this purchase met and exceeded my expectations.  Good job Amazon on offering a quality product at a great price.
4.0,I bought this watch for my niece and she loves it.
4.0,"So I’m 5’9 and I read the reviews. I was really worried it would be too short. Now I will say I’ll have to wear some shorts under it because it’s perforated and it might show your goods if you are tall and bend a weird way. It says it runs small and it does, I sized up. Normally a medium and I ordered a large. There’s no lining under it so keep that in mind when choosing a color."
4.0,Fabric is very soft and looks pretty.
4.0,little snug but works and looks good
4.0,Great necklace very cute and pretty. The chain broke as soon as I got it though so make sure to pick up another chain.
4.0,I got this for  alittle over $5. Buying any item in that price range you expect it as not many uses type of wear. It is a beautiful design and close to as pictured which surprised me. It is a good size for many average size necks. I am 31 average weight for my height and it fits great on the tighter settings. The design is cute very goth but also girlie. The gem was tilted a bit not perfectly straight for those with ocd I took off a star because it had that small defect many cant notice but I do . It is costume type jewelry I don't expect many uses out of this but it would definitely last at least three wears. Mine came packaged fine with no damage except the red gem tilted. I will add photos and I hope this review was helpful to you ! It is lightweight and you do have the option to make it tight or loose which is great !
4.0,"Was looking for small huggie earrings and these are normal sized, reviews and pictures from people who bought them are missleading"
4.0,"You pay for what you get with this product, it is basic and serves its purpose well. My husband wrists it about 7 inches and it fits comfortably."
4.0,I liked this costume. It seemed like the real deal. Even though it was just nylon. Only issue is home does one use the bathroom? I had to have someone follow me into the restroom every time to assist the 10 minute removal of the costume.
4.0,"I bought these as a gift for my boyfriend for Christmas, they're excellent quality! Very soft leather, and very soft insides. He wears them when driving. I definitely wouldn't be rough with them - no snowball fights - but they held up for the whole winter and they have worn very well. They don't crack like some cheaper leather gloves do, and they're still soft and smooth."
4.0,i like it and fit great .
4.0,Great product at a good price.  Super quick delivery.
4.0,Yes it's a sturdy bag.
4.0,extremely cute but very small
4.0,Fit as expected. loose. flowy. Flattering. It had a hole in it so I knocked off a star. I am sick of returning things so I am keeping it.
4.0,"I live in a very high elevation clear sky area. 5200 ft above sea level in the city. This hat blocks UV really well. The veil is perforated and seems to allow air to flow adequately. If you need UV protection you can use the hat with all the veils, if not you can remove both the perforated veil and or the back neck veil. I have used It for yard work. Hiking is at 7k to 10k and the hat is very good at blocking the UV. Only one complaint is the perforated veil sometimes blocks breathing slightly. Overall a good buy."
4.0,"Tools for standard sizes of watches, big watches can not be opened using the wrench."
4.0,"I can't really offer a review because it was sent to someone else as a gift. But they haven't said anything except, thank you."
4.0,"Beautiful and fits perfectly! My only complaint is with the description of the product. My bracelet has 115 beads. To be honest, it doesn't matter that much to me, but 108 is a very important number for meditation in some cultures. I just don't appreciate the false advertising. Still a pretty beacelet, though."
4.0,Wish top had more support. Fit is flattering though.
4.0,"Very average quality, however I was glad it was not quite as bulky as pictured. I does fit TTS, however, a bit shorter than in photo on my (5'5&#34;). For he price I will keep. A nice, quick sweater to throw on with boots and denim. A must for the NW."
4.0,"I love these leggings although they are plus size they fit fine if you just want to slip on a pair of leggings. I do wish they were a little tighter, but are very comfortable. The length is right for me. Long enough. I'm 5' 8&#34;."
4.0,"They are lightweight, which makes them ideal for working out.  The neckline and arm holes are not so big that a bra would show.  I would recommend them as great workout wear."
4.0,I like these slippers.  They fit just a tad small.  i am sure they will stretch a bit and will be fine.
4.0,love hoop earings and i'm always wearing black so that's a plus. i have three holes in each ear so this too was definetely a plus.  the only thing is they aren't very sturdy...i have a feeling after a few times taking them on and off they will break.
4.0,I was actually surprised when I opened it. What a treasure! I bought it as a gift and now thinking of buying one for myself.
4.0,"I bought these socks prior to a 3 month backpacking trip. Now obviously these are not 100% merino wool so I did not expect them to be the most amazing socks ever. However, I was pleasantly surprised. The socks are comfortable and I was able to wear them for a couple days at a time before needing to wash them. They did start to pill a bit after the first wash, but not so much that I couldn’t wear them. I’d recommend these socks if you need something budget friendly that will still hold up after heavy use."
4.0,It fits perfectly and matches my watch ..
4.0,As always good quality and fast shipping However these are a bigger 11.5 than my previous 3 pairs were. I wear braces on feet/legs so not a big problem.
4.0,"Super Great Quality!!! However, dimesions is not exactly 22mm. A drop less. See picture.<br />But much better then my orriginal Skagen quality. Nice!! Piece!!"
4.0,"well made, excellent price, but they run about 3 sizes too small. I wear a size small and a large in these was too small."
4.0,"warm, not so soft BUT really comfortable to wear. thank you"
4.0,"I love the earrings, but I am not fond of how the earrings are attached to the ear hook.  The 2 pieces can separate and you may lose the earring part."
4.0,"I wanted a mustard toggle coat. The quality of this coat is excellent, the price was excellent, and the fit is excellent. I am very pleased with the purchase!<br /><br />Update: Downgraded to four stars. I have worn the coat maybe 10 times for more than 15 minutes. The sleeves are piling significantly. Disappointing because I really love the coat."
4.0,Definitely buy two sizes up.  I normally wear a medium in shirts and I bought an extra large.  The shirt is really sheer and see thru so you will be wearing a shirt underneath.  The price was perfect which is good because it takes a long time to be shipped.
4.0,"It's a nice handbag made of good leather.  It is a little more boxy looking than the photo and the color is between an oxblood red and wine.  It's not as trendy looking as the photo, a little on the matronly side.  Therefore the 4 star rating."
4.0,They fit as expected. The material is a little more silky on the outside then I thought but.. it's ok. They are pretty comfy.
4.0,"I feel we paid a fair price for a very good product. We're very satisfied. Some people think that a product is bad if it gets fewer than 5 stars, but I don't feel that way. Very, very few products deserve 5 stars in my mind."
4.0,"Cute, but it's way too big for my 12 month old. Looks like it would fit more like a 2T T-shirt.  Looks like this will be her outfit for next year.  Wish I would've gotten a smaller size."
4.0,"Fabric is ok, I  thought fabric might be a little more soft. It runs larger than some of the reviews ."
4.0,Im not sure if this cuff is in fact real leather. It had the cloth backing wich typically means no. But the cuff fits well and looks good.
4.0,Looks great and thick Mayer but it is not forgiving as it doesn’t stretch much. I got a large and had to give it my daughter as it fit more like a medium. Size up and you’ll love it.
4.0,Too small fits like a pantu
4.0,"These are some pretty cool sunglasses! They have an all metal frame which gives them added durability. The geometric design makes them a great accessory, as well. The only drawback I have with them is that the nose bridge rests are also made of metal and hang down, so when I put them on top of my head and then go to put them back on they usually end up pulling my hair. But they're not bad for I think the $5 I paid for them. I'd probably spend $10-$20 for ones of similar quality."
4.0,"1) Light Pink with flare sleeves - Lovely fabric, cute design....sizing off! I bought an XL (my size) and the dress can barely go over my shoulders.<br />2) Fuschia with frilled hem - colour was not as dark, but very strong fabric, fit to size (XL), looking forward to wearing it!"
4.0,"(A photo w/ flash and one w/o)<br /><br />Got my pins delivered and they look great! I really like how they came in a small dark purple bag that I can use as well separately. The pins are bigger than I imagined but aren’t overly big either so they’re nice. Only the Tanjiro pin likes to flip itself around and hangs upside down, but all pins eventually move from its original position so I don’t exactly mind…Would definitely recommend them."
4.0,Very happy with the shirt!
4.0,Clasp is near impossible alone and chain is too light for most activities. Does look nice though.
4.0,"Bought these over a year ago to use as driving sunglasses. They worked great and looked even better. For the price, you can not of make a better decision They recently met their end at the hands of a new puppy, but during the time I had them they where my go to sunglasses."
4.0,I purchased this as a workout headband/sweatband. My biggest hope for this product was that it would not slip and slide during a strenuous workout. This headband delivered that. It was a little lighter weight than I expected. The headband folds over on itself so you can make it a narrower width easily by trifolding it or wider by folding in half. Colors are vibrant and accurately portrayed in the product pictures.  Overall a good workout headband.<br /><br />I received this item at a discounted rate in exchange for my unbiased review
4.0,I was very satisfied with the product it is durable and metal. Looks like it does in the picture. The only thing wrong with it was the fact that some of the rings are different colors which isn't big of a deal since it is a great product overall.
4.0,Love this hat. I ordered it for a tea party I was attending and it looked really cute. I think the quality is great considering the inexpensive price tag. This hat is a great choice for a novelty type of event.
4.0,Purchased one for a gift and one for myself. I think it's very cute and colors worthwhile
4.0,"For the price they look really nice, i got 2 for my mom on Christmas. The thing is that she carries A LOT of things like heavy duty weight, so the straps suffer a little and i think one of then couldn't take it no more. But overall they are great for the price and don't look cheap at all"
4.0,Really love this scarf. It’s super soft and the colors are really flattering. Can’t wait for the cold weather to come so I can wear it!
4.0,Was very pretty but it broke the first day I had it on.
4.0,"Feminine, low profile; nice detail."
4.0,Ok but gave better.. wouldn't buy again
4.0,Little band to hold back the strap broke but for the price a great little watch
4.0,M’as o menos
4.0,"Very pretty. Just as pictured. Just the right size...not too big, but large enough to appreciate the design. These do have a black coated backing, but it doesn't take away from the design. Giving as a gift, I think she'll love them! I do!"
4.0,"This was great when I first got it, but now that I've had it a few months, the elastic is starting to stretch out and I need another hole (I am a pretty small size). It's not a huge deal now because I can add another hole myself but if it continues to stretch out, I will have to replace."
4.0,Guyana
4.0,Quality is better than expected and good looking sunglasses.
4.0,Gift for my Husband he loves it! Nice quality. Good price.
4.0,"Perfect, exact description!! Lost mine in a river after 2 weeks - wasted no time and bought another one!!"
4.0,"I love my sister, she is very special to me!<br />I got her this necklace as a Valentine's day present and she loved it!<br />The chain is 18&#34; long and the charms are no bigger than 2&#34;. The overall piece is very shiny and very close to what the picture shows, with some minor differences on the clarity of the &#34;sisters&#34; faces.<br />Nevertheless, for the price you pay, you get a nice detail for a special sister.<br />Remember it's not an expensive thing so do not expect Diamonds and Gold! Take it as is and enjoy the beauty of the meaning more than the value of the materials!"
4.0,"These are so comfortable! I noticed however the stitching in some spots aren't that great and at the bottom one side is longer than the other but its not noticeable if you're not really looking. I haven't tried wearing them when it was cold out yet, but I'm sure they will keep me somewhat warm!"
4.0,my daughter like this blouse
4.0,These socks are pretty cute for the price. It came from China so delivery was lengthier than one would think but not so bad. My child is a tall 2.y.o. so it fits just fine. A warm sock for cooler weather.
4.0,I thought it’d have a longer back than it does
4.0,"I have been looking for a reasonably priced coral bead necklace. I never knew coral was so expensive! I really wanted a salmon orange color with pinkish marbling. After a few weeks of searching and finding nothing I discovered this necklace on my wishlist. I wanted an 18-20"" necklace and it had to have a lobster claw clasp as I can't reach behind my neck so I use magnetic closures. I love the color of this necklace. It says pink coral and it isn't the marbling I wanted, but it is a soft pink salmon color and it's beautiful. However, the lobster claw clasp and the ring it fastens to are set right into the beads and it was impossible for me to open the clasp because the beads are large and got in the way, there isn't enough room to grasp the clasp and open it. All that's needed is to add a single ring on one, or either, side to make it easy to open. I'm sure those rings come in packages of hundreds for a couple of bucks. I took a star rating off because I had to get out some tools just to get the clasp open. Once the necklace was open I put the magnet on and then it was fine. I can't imagine why someone would go to the trouble of making these necklaces and make it so difficult to open the clasp. That seems more than a little cheap to me. The necklace itself is NOT cheap, it has the little holes and texture that identify the beads as genuine coral. But the beads are quite large, they are 12 mm, and I didn't notice that. With arthritis in my neck and shoulders it's just too heavy, so I'll be returning it."
4.0,great value  well made
4.0,"This mask worked for a little while, all the kids knew who my son was. However, he said he couldn’t see very well and it was hot. So eventually we bought a mask (for Covid wear) and put this one on his head to still show of costume."
4.0,5'8&#34;<br />160 lbs<br /><br />Purchased the small and it fit way too big.
4.0,I returned it.  It was not flattering on me
4.0,"This is a nice shirt, but was a bit snug at my usual size. I like things a bit more loose though."
4.0,In person it doesn’t look as tie dyed as it does in the picture. Super comfy though and perfect for what I wanted it for which is lounging!
4.0,Really great quality but the top portion was a little too big for me.  If I had the time I would have had it taken in.
4.0,Good product for an inexpensive price.  Keep them in the car in case you forget the Maui Jims.
4.0,Good price for both.  If you don't need the wrench (look at the back of your watch) then just buy the 16 piece set.  ADVICE:  Look at YouTube for how to.  Some good videos.  You can actually change a battery and links WITHOUT these tools.  I'm not that brave.
4.0,beautiful. Looks like a quality product. Only complaint is the metal earring backing is a bit small for the size of the earring.
4.0,"Wood arms are wide, supportive and stylish. Yellow tint, blue blocking is helping with headaches I get from regular readers. Only dingged one star for not being very durable, though they come with a nice protective case, but I’m up and back at the computer so often I don’t use it. That star is probably on me, but I wish they were more rugged."
4.0,Even though it was slightly larger then I expected I really like how it fits. The material is pretty comfy and I love how I can go anywhere with it.
4.0,These briefs seem to run a little large so I might have ordered one size smaller if I had known.  I like the cut and feel. Good purchase.
4.0,"This garment would be perfect if it were a few inches longer (I am 6'2&#34;). The fabric is soft, the color is reminiscent of the traditional kimono fabric made using indigo dye, and is incredibly comfortable. At this point, I wear it around the house for a little extra comfort and warmth with an Asian twist. I would highly recommend this for someone a few inches shorter than I am."
4.0,The material is a bit course but it is a cute hat. It does wrinkle.
4.0,"These are surprisingly fun. If anyone gets close enough to look for flaws, well they are in your personal space! At this price, even if you only like one pair, it’s still a win."
4.0,Waiting to wear it when it is really cold and post my comments. For the current temperature it feels comfortable. Good quality jacket.
4.0,"It’s a cute outfit, but the size was way off. The size runs small"
4.0,Great kids jammies
4.0,Love this. Came out perfect!
4.0,Cute shirt but it made me feel like I was wearing a bulky tshirt.
4.0,My friend liked these as a gift. kinda bulky but cute:)
4.0,THERE IS A PRODUCT LIKE THIS AT HARBOR FREIGHT STORES FOR A LOT LESS MONEY AND THEY SEEM IDENTICAL.
4.0,It fits nicely except for the length. Will have to cut it.
4.0,"Nice quality and soft fabric. I’m 5’8 and length was good but tighter in bust than I would like. Would rate a 5 but need to return and reorder a size bigger than usual, plus pattern is not exactly as shown in picture. It’s pretty but pattern was off in the chest area."
4.0,"a very well made man's hat. I have a 7 5/8 "" head size and ordered the large, its a little too tight but I'll use it. There is some strech because its knitted."
4.0,Falls over if very full. Looks reddish brown in color.
4.0,"Stones, etc, are smaller than they appear in the picture, but overall a gorgeous piece. I like it, & my wife will LOVE it!"
4.0,"I normally don't care if piercing jewelry is hard to open/close because that's a pretty good perk, I HATE losing jewelry. But wow... y'all weren't kidding. It's especially apparent in 6mm nose rings- I like a skin-tight fit as I have a small nose, and taking these in and out is a CHORE. Honestly takes me more than a couple minutes, and I'm used to switching out jewelry a lot for work.<br /><br />That being said, this was the only listing for a variety pack of 6mm 16g rings. And also a great price."
4.0,Great fit and comfortable. I’m looking to buy again in different colors.
4.0,"We had to return the first one and get a bigger size.  It was a size larger than my daughter usually wears. She loves the dress, but I hate the color. We cut the sleeves to elbow length, and because the material doesn't fray it was easy to cut a scallop edge like it had before. It worked great."
4.0,"Really, really cute, but really, really short. I'm 5'4"" 150lbs c cup (i think??) just had a baby and got large which fit perfect in all areas BUT its way too short to wear anywhere. I'm just going to have to wear over leggings in the spring/fall. White was totally see through, nips and all so sent that one back."
4.0,Cute ! Thin quality but great for what it'll be used for. Fits 18 inch dolls well. Cute add on christmas gift.
4.0,"I was just sick of getting texts on my watch. Switched to this and never will go back. My only complaint is the light. The light only shines from the right side of the face panel. You can tell time but its a struggle sometimes. Maybe mines broken, who knows."
4.0,Comfortable and  quality.
4.0,"I am 5&#34;5 & 194lbs, I love the color and wish I have gotten another. It's lightweight and stretches well. It's longer than I expected but that's not a bad thing. Very &#34;fitting&#34; on the body and can be easily dressed up. It feels like a spandex material."
4.0,Good quality and the edges are mostly smooth. I got them for favor boxes for a birthday party. Each piece comes with a chain so you don't have to buy that separately unless you don't like what it comes with. A couple pictures were a little off center but that's no big deal.
4.0,I love these earrings.  Scooby is so much fun.
4.0,"I'm 5""6"", 36AA and about a 28 inch waist. The medium fit me perfectly! I bought the tie dye blue. It's cropped but if you wear high waist leggings it does not show much middle. Not too much padding and form fitting but not tight. It fits close enough to my body that I don't need to wear a bra if I wear it with the pads. I do wish this top was about 2 inches longer."
4.0,"SHE LIKED BUT, WOULD HAVE BEEN A FIVE STAR IF THEY HAD SPRING HINGES"
4.0,Beautiful and exactly what they are supposed to be.
4.0,"That is why one of the panels says &#34;Whosoever dies  WEARING this scapular shall not suffer eternal fire&#34; Our Lady's scapular promise. That is from the brown scapular on me right now.<br />That being said, one is not REQUIRED to wear one. It is a personal devotion developed when the laity started to imitate the much, much, much larger scapulars worn by those in religious communities. You are free to hang it on a statue but it is meant to be worn"
4.0,"Based on reviews I ordered a size Large thinking it would be true to size, and I should have gone one size up to an XL."
4.0,"I received this as a promotional item to review:  these do what they say they do, they keep your shirt tucked in and neat.  If you're in a medium-movement occupation it does ok, but there's occasional readjustment required.  They're really good.  The best?  Maybe close."
4.0,"Bought this for my wife, it fits her as expected."
4.0,Doesnt spin alot but thats ok with me
4.0,Granddaughter  loves it
4.0,It's a pretty good items so far
4.0,"This is a high-quality hoodie made of nice, thick fleece. My son loves it and wears it all the time. It has aged well and still looks good after many washings."
4.0,"White around the edges, so not as shown....but they fit nice (and I have a big face) and I love the color."
4.0,"It's cute, but runs a bit small. There isn't much stretch to the fabric surprisingly, so be aware of that when making your sizing decision."
4.0,Nice looking and fit me perfect on a medium size. I am 122 lb and 5 feet 2 inch.
4.0,Quality matches the price
4.0,A little tight.  Great for children.
4.0,I got this shirt to go with leggings for a blousy but casual look. Since it was a one size fits all I wasn't sure what to expect but since the price was so good I decided to take a chance<br /><br />It arrived much quicker than expected. Upon further inspection the material is much nicer than I thought it'd be. Not too cheap nor thin or clingy. I am about 5'8 and wear a medium or large in tops. This fits perfect as a short dress or long top but definitely need to wear leggings.<br /><br />Overall it's a Nice piece to spruce up your wardrobe for just a few bucks
4.0,"Fit was great, the bottom skirt section was tighter than I expected (then again I'm not small in that area) it's also pretty transparent in that area....that was unexpected. Also, the sleeve ends were large and made the sleeves look like parachutes. Other than those easy fixes, the dress's color is great as well as the design."
4.0,Beautiful ! Looks exactly as pictured.
4.0,I purchased this for my brother. To my surprise it’s not cheap looking and every piece is functional. I was figuring about half these would actually be in perfect condition.
4.0,Got tired of my child stealing my shoes.  Now he can wear his own!
4.0,Decent quality for stainless
4.0,Sizes were vague. My daughter wears between 18-25 months so I bought the 1-2 year and the pants fit (maybe slightly big) but the shirt is huge. Hoping it shrinks some.
4.0,I sweat a lot so this is a problem for me but if I were weight lifting instead of doing Hitt or cardio then it would be fine but just something to think about. I love the fit and feel they are overall great but you can see the sweat
4.0,"Simple & comfy, not as long as expected. Size fit as per Seller size chart. Purple is more of a Red Purple not as much a Blue Purple as shown. Washes well in the machine on Cold at lover setting & hanged drive."
4.0,"Great hat, what I saw some of my fav celebrities wear recently, too. Know this isn't a breathable golf hat though!"
4.0,"Nice hat. I had to return it because of a size issue. If they had a medium, I'd have gladly exchanged it."
4.0,"Loved the fabric, wore it to a party"
4.0,"Fits well, padding where u need it. Legs don't creep up. Fast shipping"
4.0,I was worried it might be to small but it fits perfectly. You can dress it up with nylon’s or wear leggings under it. Great fun for Halloween
4.0,"Beautiful necklace, but the layers are not all in line, the beads are slightly off to the side. But for the price, I won't complain."
4.0,I love these belts and they are stretchable ones.  Never used a belt for my top in a loooooong time.
4.0,I really like the style and beautiful pearl and silver qualities!  I would have preferred it was somewhat bigger.<br />I wear it often to remind me to 'go with the flow' and enjoy life.
4.0,"This is a very cute dress. I wanted to wear it for a wedding, but the buttons look a little differently when on vs. the model. I would consider purchasing this for a casual dress in the future."
4.0,"Very warm.  I like the look too, I was thinking about buy a couple to wear as regular shirts.  The sizes run larger than I expected, I'm 6'0 and about 220 lbs., so I bought an extra large.  Its too lose to keep the heat in like the matching pair of pants I bought, which seem to fit well."
4.0,Liked as a grandson gift.
4.0,Mexico trip
4.0,It fits a little tight around the chest area.
4.0,These are nice sturdy active shorts. They seemed to be a little on the large and long side which may be part my fault as I ordered Large thinking it would be better to be a little loose for hiking and comfort. I usually wear a 34 waist and generally a Large fits comfortably for running and hiking.
4.0,"Other than one of the rings breaking, these have been very nice"
4.0,"I ordered true to size and it fit perfectly. Just what I wanted for a casual summer dress! I had to return the first one because there was a slit in the middle of the fabric, but the next one was fine."
4.0,Actually shirt doesn’t match the colors of the pictures. She is still cute but it definitely puts a damper on the review.
4.0,Loved it and was awesome to wear around. However an improvement would be to make it lengthy.
4.0,"My reason for 4 stars rather than 5 - for the size of the bra I'd have expected the width of the back to be as wide as a bra with 4 hook and eyes in the back.  Also in comparison to other bras the same size, the cups are a little shy, BUT, it's comfortable, hooks in front and is pretty much invisible under clothing.  The front hook is GREAT - slips in one way then locks in place with a quarter turn - so no fear of it coming undone while out.  I've had that happen before - YIKES.  ~~ deb"
4.0,Heavy but made pretty well :)
4.0,Size listed says &#34;XL - Men 13-14&#34; but actual tag on the item says &#34;XL - Men 12-13&#34; so a little small but still good
4.0,"I really love this coat/jacket.  The colors are vibrant and I was surprised at how well it is made.  I purchased an XXL based upon reviews and it is definitely one X too many.  I normally wear a L (based upon the manufacturer) but I wanted this to be loose enough to wear over sweaters or thin jackets.  I could have gone down to an XL and maybe even a L.  (For reference I'm 5'2"" and 145 lbs.)  the coat hit me a little below mid-calf.  Something I did not notice is that the sleeves are open and belled.  Since this coat is NOT returnable, I will keep it and it will certainly be used.  I may get another one in a different print and go down a size....or two."
4.0,"A little baggy, why can't we get tactical pants that fit more like jeans? I don't need an 80&#34; inseam on my 32x32 pants..."
4.0,"Fits nice, soft fabric. Washes and dries easily. Order up for a loose fit."
4.0,I really like this sweater. Great dark yellow color. It is pretty light weight.
4.0,"This is a beautiful bracelet! I took off one star because it is very small...it definitely does not fit around my wrist.  I will be giving this as a gift for Christmas and I know they will love it.  The beads and very sparkly and you can tell that it is real gold.  I really wish it was a little bigger, but I still think this is a great product as long as you make sure to measure your wrist before purchasing.  I also appreciate the fact that the company makes a donation to charity for each product they sell...that is the mark of a good business."
4.0,My girlfriend really likes these. They look pretty hot on her. She says they fit her nice and aren't heavy or uncomfortable.
4.0,My daughter doesn't like layers of clothes so she's never worn a housecoat. This houseboat is so soft and the gradient looks beautiful.
4.0,"these are good suits, don't shy away just because they are cheap.  they are nice suits"
4.0,"Cute, well fitted golf pants.  Shape retention is pretty good.  The only thing I didn't really like, is that the back waist pulls down (of course) when you bend over to pick up your ball, or to tee it up, and I'm always having to manually lift the waist into place again.  But generally the fit is great:  sleek and smooth. Quite comfortable too."
4.0,"First impression:<br />Cute, looks like the pictures everyone sent. They're a gift and hopefully my roommate will like them. There was a slight dent on the cardboard part with the image of the gems. If it was just for me it wouldn't be as annoying but this was a gift. She'll be alright I guess. Also the earrings have no backs?<br />Not sure how I feel about them, pretty neutral at the moment. I would love to wear them myself but my ears are too sensitive for fake jewelry:( will update"
4.0,A bit heavy. Plus delivery company smashed the box and I had to glue two stones back in.
4.0,"Fits exactly how I ordered it (to size specifications) Looks great, I just wish the fur was a little fuller, but this is a great looking jacket!"
4.0,These are nice I only wish that they were darker.
4.0,"I love this skirt but I forgot that I’m short, so it sits at my shins. I still wear it all the time. Very cute!"
4.0,The Indian agate I received is beautiful!
4.0,I will be using this soon! Looks great!
4.0,It’s a soft and comfy shirt. I tied it a little in the middle and folded it under. I’m 4 months pregnant so I got this shirt to prepare for a bigger belly but what is nice about this shirt is that it looks nice even without a belly! Double score if you ask me. Currently I am 5’6” and weigh 147. I do really like this shirt.
4.0,Daughter loved it.  She sewed a logo on the back.  The sleeve came apart at the seam and needed to be restitched.
4.0,Arrived on time and as advertised.  Wish they had more colors available and also &#34;short&#34; length.
4.0,Cute but meant for younger people
4.0,"They took a lot longer to get here than expected... about a week late, however, it’s what you’d expect for the price. They do not have the adjustable ear pieces. All are a raw cut fabric, no hemming or stitching on the edges so I don’t know how well they’ll hold up. That being said. The bling is cute. For the price, they’ll be cute to wear."
4.0,"Great hat! But I chose a size large, and when I got it, it said med/lrg on the inside of the hat. My husband loves it when his hair is freshly cut, but if it starts growing out, it gets a little tight."
4.0,"The clip does it's job well. Note that is is not going to cover across the entire width of a normal tie, but will over a skinny tie"
4.0,Have to suck in my stomach to make it fit. Other than that it’s very pretty
4.0,it really shapes you're waist! came in Purple even though it had a black one in the picture and it doesn't really do anything for me. Because I'm already too skinny but I ordered for my sister and she loves it. It might be better for the winter... quite warm....came within a week with standard shipping
4.0,"Comfy, but runs 2 sizes too small. Not everyone is 5' 2"" and 100 lbs...."
4.0,"This dress is exactly what I had hoped for. It's light and airy and elegant, all at the same time. However, of you sweat a lot, like I do, wear it only on a cool day or only to dinner. Other than that is beautiful. The size does run big. I usually order a size L and it's too big on me. Will be exchanging it for a medium. Only reason why I'm giving it 4 stars."
4.0,This is just what you see.  It does keep time.  I personally needed a much smaller version.  This is too heavy and big to hang on the side of my purse.  I thought it was smaller.
4.0,really well-made pant the only thing is I fit into a 10 of the exact same style of pants and a different color but I had to get a 12in this color don't know why but I really do enjoy this pant.
4.0,"I didn't find it too small, a little short maybe but it is a cover-up so it isn't supposed to be worn out as a dress. It is a bit fragile though. Just sitting with it on you can hear little threads snapping. Nothing is noticeable yet but I have only worn it 3 or 4 times so far. It is pretty though and no one else had one like it on the beach."
4.0,I really like these pants!  They are light weight and perfect for summer.  The pattern is fun and they fit well.  I recommend.
4.0,"Great fit through hips and waist, thigh area is a bit loose. Size 12 is a good fit for my 5'4&#34;, 155 lbs, straight body type. The hem hits the top of my foot. I would have given 5 stars but the fabric in the white pants is going to be hot and not suitable for wearing outside in summer. They are not see through."
4.0,i picked this out of thin watch selection and not as thin as expected  however keeps perfect time and the band adjusted for large wrist.  ITS A KEEPER !
4.0,"I gave the 4 little Heart Necklaces to same little girls at Church, the little girls loved the Heart Necklaces"
4.0,need to be hand washed to avoid shrinkage.
4.0,"PRO:  Cute colors.  Well made.  Does the job.  Fast shipping.  Great price.  Washes nicely.<br />CON:  More like a mid rise bikini brief rather than a full waisted brief.  Unless you've got a flat stomach & abs of steel, this might bother you."
4.0,Seems durable. Zipper is a little flimsy but great value for the money spent.
4.0,it is a good quality hat. I don't wear hats as a rule but this one seems good
4.0,"It’s a very warm hat, it’s just a little too big"
4.0,"I liked that this bag arrived quickly. It is made of a nice thick material. I took off one star because the zipper is not attached well at one end and this is something I will have to repair. Otherwise, its a goid bag."
4.0,"It is an awesome necklace. Incredibly sparkly chain!! Beautiful color stone. I find the stone a little large for my taste, but it is a great piece."
4.0,"The tie was too small and velcro, otherwise it was a hit."
4.0,I bought this dress in black for a fun date night. I'm 5'7 and normally a medium so I went with a Large. I love it but it is short and the material does not allow you to stretch it. It's wearable but I needed to go up two sizes!
4.0,The shirt did shrink a little bit in the wash but still fits.  It is soft and comfortable and my son loves it.
4.0,"It's a super cute skirt, however I wish hair and fuzzies wouldn't stick to it as much"
4.0,I got this shirts for my husband. It fits him as expected and he finds it comfortable to wear. The color to me is a bit different from the picture. Overall it’s good for casual office wear. Would recommend.
4.0,"Fast delivery, next time I will order one size up love the comfortable and he loves it on me."
4.0,"With clothes these days seemingly getting more form fitting shapewear is more common and needed even for teenagers. I got this top for my teenage daughter who has a slim but curvy figure.  She wears between a small and a medium but I decided to go with a large/extra large so that it would not be pressing in to tightly. The top is made from 80% nylon and 20% spandex so it has quite a bit of stretch, while the ribbing gives the soft fabric more of a texture against the skin and helps the stretchy fabrics pull in. The shirt fits very tightly even in the larger size, but is not uncomfortable. She did have to get used to the ribbed texture, and was not thrilled with it against her skin. One of the best features is the long length with allows the top to be worn not just under shirts but makes it a nice addition under a dress as well. Overall it is a good piece of shapewear, it definitely gives her a slimmer more defined look beneath her clothes when she chooses, I would definitely size up  when possible, and wear it around the house a few times when you first get it to get comfortable wearing it."
4.0,These hose are banded at the top and cause them to cut into your leg. Otherwise good
4.0,Shirt size was smaller than expected. The shirt is comfortable and material seems to be good quality. Would buy again. But would get a size bigger than normal
4.0,This is almost a great Watch band. It looks elegant and I like the matching color and the fact that it slips right on just like the original band. The flaw in my case is the fact that you can’t get the size just right. It’s either too tight or to sloppy. The clasp is less than desirable but is fuctional. It would greatly help if you could put an adjustable clasp on it for finer adjustments other than that my wife loves it.
4.0,"The dress is pretty. If you have hips, one move and your underwear will be showing."
4.0,"I order a size 38 belt , the belt is several inches shorter than my other 38&#34; belt and probably should be listed as a size 36.  I just lost 15 pounds and a inch plus off my waist and the belt fits fine; however 6 months ago before I lost the weight I would have been on the last notch and probably returned it. It a great belt for the price.  If you are a true size to the belt size I would suggest ordering a size larger."
4.0,Great coverage. Very flattering.
4.0,"1 star off because we didn't notice it was missing an aglet until after the tags were off and the packaging long gone. It's a somewhat unique aglet, so I'm not sure about finding a replacement for it. Also didn't realize the patch on it before buying. It's not terrible, but the shirt would have been far better without it. Other than that, he says it's comfortable, likes the material, and fits nicely. I think it looks good on him, FWIW. He's 6'3"" and we ordered the XXL."
4.0,"Pretty set, but it was shedding a decent amount of glitter. Hardly noticeable when you are wearing Indian clothes though!"
4.0,"way too much packaging for the size of the item, but the watch is wonderful"
4.0,purchase size larger then you normally wear. very pretty just wish it  fit.
4.0,This is cute. It washed well. The only con is that the buttons clink--kind of annoying.
4.0,I do have a high instep so it's a bit tight but I love it Anyway
4.0,"They're beautiful really but it's a 4 star from me for inaccurate website description.  Wanted a large gem for a cosplay and got something less than an inch long.  Perfect for jewelry making,  not so great for bigger projects"
4.0,Fabric is a bit cheap; not real silk. It looks and feels good as sleepwear though.
4.0,It’s cute. Really thin material and it is a lot more crop top than in the pic.
4.0,"I both like and dislike this wallet.  I like that is is small and has the RFID, but I dislike it because it is small.  I just wish it were a bit bigger and could carry more.  Like all women, I have &#34;stuff&#34; I need with me at all times."
4.0,I would not recommend sizing up as some reviews say.  I felt like the length would have been fine too had I not sized up.  Fabric is nice.
4.0,"Delivered on time, great product!"
4.0,This purse has a lot of bling!  The rhinestones are shiny and nice.  I’m not sure how long the rhinestones will last but it does come with a few spare ones to glue on should any fall off. The shoulder strap is nice. The details on the smaller strap are pretty.  This is more for fancy occupations. Use it delicately. This will defiantly make a fashion statement.
4.0,"This top seemed well made, but it is a thicker less stretchy material.  The sleeves did not fit my arms.  I have other tops like this which I love, but they are a lighter fabric with more stretch.  I think this tunic would be lovely for anyone with “normal” arms (no droopy bat wings...LOL).<br />I am returning this since it didn’t fit and the return process was very easy."
4.0,Material has more of a shine than I thought it would. Lightweight and modest fit.
4.0,Item did not come broken so that was a plus. Haven t worn it yet but should be ok
4.0,"Fit as expected, some review said that fit small but what I rec’d fit to size"
4.0,"I purchased two of as stocking stuffers for my daughter. I figured they would be great for for stacking but I clearly didn’t read the description thoroughly enough. These are soft rings. This equates to basically a necklace for your finger. They seemed really odd to me but my daughter absolutely loves them. I don’t expect that they will last very long between being somewhat fragile BUT they are super cute on her, and for the price, that’s enough.<br /><br />These were packaged nicely and came with a nice card about a portion of each purchase being donated.<br /><br />All-in-all, we are happy."
4.0,Great lighter weight short for this very hot days.  Fix well & love the drawstring & pockets!
4.0,These earrings are prettier in person. I would like to get a second pair in another color.
4.0,I’d say it’s true to size. The material is thin but it looks good on.
4.0,Great flip flop for the price
4.0,Wonderful material that will not show underneath your clothing.
4.0,"[[ASIN:B015JHPKS0 Wallet SHARKK RFID Protected Aluminum Wallet with Cash Band Rugged Water Resistant Wallet Card Holder (Gray)]]<br /><br />When I first got the SHARKK wallet, I was a bit concerned about it's size and inflexibility. For years now, I have been using a small leather bifold for a wallet which is now torn up and ready for the garbage. When I first put the SHARKK wallet in my pocket, I KNEW it was there. But just as quickly, I got used to it and it wasn't long before I didn't notice it at all. Since I tend to put my wallets in my front pocket, it was even less intrusive than I thought it might be.<br /><br />I love the sleek design and it quickly becomes a conversation piece when you pull it out of your pocket. I really love the accordion-style card holders inside. It's easy to find the card you need when you need it instead of my old wallet where I had to dig through everything to find what I was looking for.<br /><br />Like other reviewers, I'm not crazy about the cash band on the outside of the wallet (although the band itself is more than tight enough to hold your paper bills). I don't like the fact that your bills are out in the open when you pull the wallet out for the world to see. To keep it low profile, I keep the $1 bills on the outside :)<br /><br />I haven't had a chance to test out the RFID stopping capabilities of the wallet, but I work at a retail store that uses RFID technology so I hope to be able to test it out soon.<br /><br />Overall, I'd say this is a great wallet for the security conscious (and in today's world, that's just about everybody). And for me, it's simple and sleek design work well together in one simple package."
4.0,Bought it for the color
4.0,"I am 5'6"" and 220lbs and have a DDD bust. This dress was very flattering and the fabric is not see-through like other dresses I have purchased on Amazon. I love the black with the orange floral pattern. Very comfortable and would purchase another one. Gave it 4 stars instead of 5 for 2 reasons: the elastic around the waist came up to just the bottom of my breast line which could convey a pregnancy look but I didn't think it did on me.  The 2nd reason was that the dress was short. It hits right about at my ankles. Wore it flip flops and called it good!  I ordered the XXL"
4.0,..
4.0,"I got this with the vintage silver and I love the way it looks. This is wood on the inside and the outside has Nordic rune symbols. It's a unisex ring, with a unique design."
4.0,The dress fits great. However the 1st dress I received had plain white fabric on the flap giving a bib-like appearance.🤦🏽‍♀️ But the 2nd dress I ordered after returning the 1st was great. I wore it to my graduation.
4.0,"At first glance, I thought it was a bit frumpy but once it was on, I was surprised to see how nice it fit"
4.0,"Loved how it fit and the color. I wasn't sure how it was going to lay on my body, but it is really nice."
4.0,"I love these glasses.  They look great...  are of sturdy build &  great quality, &  for what they cost,  the deal can't be beat."
4.0,These medium worked
4.0,"Little difficult to get on at first, but once they are on they are great!"
4.0,My grandson is 8 and yes it was a little big but it’s supposed to be. He didn’t care he Loved it. Made Grandma happy 😃
4.0,Looks great! Wish it was a little heavier knit but still good. Gave it to my boss for Christmas . She’s always cold at work and she is constantly misplacing her phone. Since it has a pocket I thought it would be good!
4.0,"I like the color.  I don't like the interior, but it i ok"
4.0,Yummy. Fits nicely and feels good. One star off for 2 popped stitches on one side from pretty sloppy sewing at that spot.
4.0,Product arrived on time. Large pocket is not as deep as I thought it would be. Purse does not expand much.
4.0,Wore the dress for a wedding.  Do wish it fastened at the back of the neck instead of at the side
4.0,"Oh my gosh, I love this swimsuit! It is the cutest!! Sadly I have to return it because my chest is way too big to fit. I keep popping out - like, all the way out! This is best suited for small chested women. I got an XL and it fits perfectly everywhere and is so well made. I’m super bummed I can’t wear it."
4.0,"Cute white, inexpensive hat... I have matching sunglasses.... I wore it during the spring, so I can't comment on its warmth, however, it could be slouchier!!!"
4.0,This was a cute and inexpensive way to get in the holiday spirit! It's very lightweight which  is fine for me because I'm always hot and not in a good way! I usually wear a Large and I ordered an XL. I'm glad I did because I think if it were tighter it would be a little see-through.
4.0,"I was making pendants to be given as gifts. These chains are a little short, so please note the length."
4.0,Reading the reviews I got a size or two above my actual size and it fits me nicely. I do wish the the bow was so flimsy.
4.0,"I am not really sure what I was expecting but I am happy with the purchase. I like the way it looks and it is less bulky The strap comes out rather easily and that is the only thing I do not like about it. It doesn't come unbuckled or slide up and down my wrist or anything which is nice, but I hate when the strap falls out. The color is really nice and the band is super soft. I would buy again in another color if I found one I loved more than this one."
4.0,I've always wanted a pair of moccasins and finally found a pair that was reasonably priced. I ordered a slightly smaller size so that I could break it into fitting my feet perfectly. After wearing it a couple of times and walking around the house it loosened up and felt like I was wearing socks. Wht I really like about these is the fact that they don't clack against the wooden floors like hard bottom slippers and they don't flop against my feet as I walk.
4.0,"when I ordered it I wasn't sure what size to order and what to expect from the reviews. when it arrived, by some miracle the size Small fit perfectly. Although I am short (5'3) and relatively thin. the quality and fabric was okay it wasn't high quality like a sturdy made to last uniform, but it wasn't as transparent and cheap as I expected it to be. the sewing on the arm cuffs was coming apart a little bit when I pulled the sleeves up so I sewed over the seam to make it stronger. overall I have an obsession with anime-like kawaii uniforms and am very pleased with my purchase! the skirt is a little short so it may have been better to get a size Medium so the skirt would fall lower on my waist. the skirt is about 2 inches higher than my fingertips."
4.0,Hat ran a little small.
4.0,"I ended up returning this item. I'm 5'2"" and around 115 pounds, and bought a size small. The quality and most of the fit was as expected, but the skirt was longer than I thought it would be. Based on the picture I thought it would hit just under the knee, but in reality it ended closer to mid-calf."
4.0,very comfy..i like it but it seems as if its stripping already
4.0,This is a cute set but my 7 year old could not fit in the gloves or shoes.. this set runs small better for 3-5yr old kids.
4.0,"Delivery was super fast and the product is as expected, but I purchased this for a Christmas present and the packaging was a clear bag!  No surprises here for Christmas!"
4.0,Great item as<br />Described the band is slim which is what I like about it. Perfect fit
4.0,"I love the fact that it spins. I already owned another ring similar to it in the fact that it also spins, which is why I ordered this one. It's just something to play with and do when you're bored in class or just need something to fiddle with. The color is also very nice, and I'm glad I came across it while I was browsing."
4.0,These fit as expected and are quite comfortable to wear.
4.0,Cute solid purse. My granddaughter loved it
4.0,The pants are great but I gave it 4 stars because they run very large.
4.0,Nice looking cap but wish the bill was wider.
4.0,"Cute, decent fabric, just a bit longer that most tanks.  And im short so I would have liked it to be a bit shorter but it works."
4.0,Love the color and it fits great but I sent it back because I did not like the material. Wish it was made from cotton.
4.0,"Narrow field of vision and limited range, but overall it meets the advertised functionality."
4.0,We bought it because the picture looks greenish.  But the item is VERY yellow.<br />They have super easy returns though.
4.0,Comfortable with a dope cushion.
4.0,Fits good I'm satisfied
4.0,"Very cute dress.  I was hoping I would have liked it more buy I am partly to blame.  READ THE SIZING INFORMATION!  I would have gone up a size. The material is not cheap looking and it is not see through.  It will take some work to keep it unwrinkled.  It has the feel of a heavy linen.  It will still breath nicely though. The straps are adjustable, which is very useful.  Like someone else posted, it does gap oddly in the armpit area.  I was not concerned about this,  as I am larger busted,  but it did on me as well.  The pockets are a nice touch and are functional.  It is sewn together somewhat cheaply.  Will it hold up for multiple summers,  likely not.  The color was as pictured for the blue.  It did go all the way to the floor on me but I am only 5'4&#34;.  I believe that it was not as drapey as pictured because of my goof with the sizing.  I will be keeping it because even though it wasn't big enough to drape as it should,  it is still fits me well enough to wear as a standard maxi dress.  Okay my specs,  I ordered a large.  I am 5'4 and 165lbs.  I am larger busted at 36D-DD.  In summary,  great price,  watch the sizing,  okay dress for the price,  and I will likely order another one in a large size in a different color."
4.0,Nice quality but shoe fits large.
4.0,I found them kool to have
4.0,"Kind of cheap but overall not bad for first starting to craft,  i won't buy again because I had a few break in use and i would just like them to be absolutely study and well made."
4.0,"I've used this bag twice now with no issues. It makes a great carry on for travel, and has plenty of space (I've packed 6 days worth of clothing so far). If the inside if full, it's hard to get stuff in the outside pockets."
4.0,"the fabric of these pants is way better than expected after going through many different options from amazon.  it's thick, it's solid, there's no option for see-thru - just a really nice fabric, for real.<br /><br />the fit - not as awesome, they are slightly small - i should have ordered a size up but i'm also losing weight right now, so hey maybe new pants when i thinner!  plus i know like them!  the even better part of these pants, they are super versatile.  they look like regular pants - you could easily wear them to work or out or however you like.  they do actually fit right now - with a large sweatshirt, no one would know they were a bit tight in the waist, but i a little more excited about losing the weight and getting into them perfectly"
4.0,Very comfy hooded sweatshirt but wish it had the front pocket. Otherwise love it.
4.0,"This is a really cute sweatshirt but beware, the color is totally different than the picture. It’s a light pink color, similar to pepto bismol instead of the rusty pink color in the picture."
4.0,"This is a really interesting necklace to add to your collection.  It's a nice piece to wear casually to work or brunch.  It does not look high-end, but it doesn't look excessively cheap either.  The interesting pattern allows it to be a more versatile piece because it adds a kind-of artistic element to whatever look you are wearing, more than just a simple ""pretty"" added bling to the outfit.  It does that too, but I think it's the design that makes it more interesting.  It's interesting enough that someone who likes more eccentric pieces can have fun with it, but it's also close enough to a classic design, that even someone who prefers conservative/classic jewelry pieces can still feel comfortable with it as well.  I'm not sure I'd gift it unless I knew it would really fit the style of a person, but it's still a good piece.  Could work well for a gift exchange.  For a very reasonable price, I think it's a neat piece you'll enjoy having."
4.0,Fit my 91 year old Dad and he likes them
4.0,"I love the material, it’s well made. I ordered a medium... 5’4 130lbs 34B."
4.0,"Keeps you warm but the size fit is way off. I ordered an XL and the zipper doesn’t clear my body by more than 5-6 inches. Might be XL for one of the LOTR Shire dwellers, but not a typical homosapien."
4.0,Cute dress. Needs a better seamstress... Loose threads are going to be the reason for a short life for this frock. 4 star rating due to VERY poor stitching.
4.0,I loved the jumpsuitams it fit perfectly but the zipper is very cheap.
4.0,Really the only problem is the hat kind of fits weird and is made a bit badly
4.0,I thought the wallet had a bill divider but it it not.  Had plenty of card slots and nice window for ID.  Happy with the purchase.
4.0,"After a few swims, the scales faded in the rear atea and it looked like stained feces."
4.0,They are nice and feel comfortable but they fit kind of strange. The leg part is pretty short and they often allow things to pop out of the leg hole.  Overall they are a solid boxer
4.0,"I loved the length, It was just really tight in the arms."
4.0,"Fits fairly well, maybe a teeny bit small, but maybe I'm bloated LOL. Dress is nice and fabric is good, just a little thin. My bra can be seen through when outside, so it needs an undershirt."
4.0,I really liked these and have already ordered a second pair. These are a thick material and move very well. The only problem I will note is that they run just slightly large.
4.0,These are cute but the unfinished edges made them look cheap.  I took a permanent black marker and colored in the edges.  (They are unfinished and white.)  I think the earrings look a lot better and not cheap.
4.0,"Great legging for working out! I’ve only worn them twice to high intensity workouts but they’re great because they don’t slide down, very firm fitting. They are on the thicker side but I like that for these types of workouts. I would say they are true to size and have held up after washing twice!"
4.0,Quality is nice.  The patches on the jeans are pretty cool.  I get amazing compliments on them and a real bargain for the price.  Definitely a head turner.
4.0,"Finally, a flannel nightgown that’s not paper thin. A little big but that’s great for a nightgown."
4.0,"Very comfortable and sort.  The velcro straps are nice and thin so that they don't dig into the back of your head.  The velcro could be a little tighter and the eye sockets a little deeper, but they shut out light and are comfy."
4.0,"Soft shirt, good fit"
4.0,"These are pretty nice ties.  I do really like the style, and the quality is completely fine, but I guess I don't wear a suit that much so when I do, I would mostly prefer really fancy ties.  That said, I will definitely wear these simply because they are more in style now than some of my others - and they are nice.  The box is just a box, so not really fancy for a gift.  I don't want to waste money on a box, so it's fine for me, but if you think it's going to be super fancy it's not.  Probably great for a young guy just starting out with a job."
4.0,"I'm 5'7 125lbs and I ordered a medium although I should've ordered a small. The material is stretchy anyway so I would advise going a little smaller than you normally do. Overall, it's a cute dress and I'll just wear a belt to help make it look more fitted."
4.0,"Fits as expected, wish the design was better to match peter parkers spider-man suit when cosplaying as him."
4.0,"I bought this for my two year old and she loved it. She started complaining the waist, that is an elastic band, is too tight and now she won't put it on. It is really nice and flowy and super stretchy soft."
4.0,Wonderful fit for serious Grogu (Baby Yoda) /Mandalorian/Boba Fete fans. What’s not to love?!?
4.0,Dresst was comfortable material is  thin  love the bright colors will need to slip or body shaper I wore a medium
4.0,"The quality of this item is great. The colors of the flowers are bright and the packaging was nice, but it didn’t fit over my hand. It’s for a very small wrist!"
4.0,"I have extremely narrow heels and wear out the back of my inner heels on my running shoes within a couple of months because of the slippage.  While other stick in type of heel pads prevent the slipping, the gap between the bottom of the pad and the top of the orthotic insert end up rubbing blisters on my heels.  With this product, I can eliminate that gap by removing the insole, inserting the heel pad, and then placing my orthotic on top of it.  It provides a more seamless transition and NO blisters!!  These are very padded, so I needed to go up a half size on my shoe, but the end result is COMFORT and NO SLIPPAGE!!  Awesome product and awesome service by the shipper.  I now have my slippage problems and blister issues resolved!!<br /><br />1/30/17--Review revision--I had to change this to 4 stars only because the adhesive on these is NOT sticking well to the backs of my shoes.  Looks like I'll need a little flexible fabric glue to keep them on there, but I still like the product."
4.0,I needed this product as a prop for photos. It worked great for my purpose.
4.0,"This is a very sexy swimsuit for a plus size woman, the color is beautiful the green is really bright and i love that. I ordered based on the reviews i read and it fits well just has to be taken in slightly. I got the 4xl but the 3xl would have been perfect, these sizes seem to run small because i usually wear a xl whole piece i am 210lbs my waist in a 38.  I am in the process of weight loss so i wanted something to reveal a bit more than the average whole piece and this is perfect. I love it and it holds your breast in place even though it has no cups but it has two small circle pads which i will be removing really serves no purpose, overall it was well made good material and delivery was fast. I will be odering the other color in the smaller size. I gave 4 stars because it was slightly big"
4.0,It fits ok I ordered an XL still a bit small. It's still pretty nice.
4.0,Very nice slippers but your feet do tend to get too warm.
4.0,"I usually get shirts in mediums. So, I bought this in medium. But, it was way too big for me. I like the color and quality so I'm returning it and getting it in small."
4.0,really like the skirt. length was perfect for my 5'6&#34;frame.
4.0,"The touch screen thing was a little finicky it took some getting used to, considering that it's a highlighted feature I thought it would work a little bit more efficiently. Otherwise it's a good fit and it's comfortable."
4.0,Fitting perfect and also material as mentioned.
4.0,The bathing suit is very pretty and made with great material. The top fit perfectly but the bottoms did not fit at all. I am normally a small and ordered a medium. I am a bit curvy from the bottom so perhaps if you are curvy I would suggest you order a larger bottom. But I do like the bathing suit all together.
4.0,"Love the fabric and style. Zipper stuck a little, but this kind usually will stick. Only real complaint is that the waist is much higher than pictured. I ordered an extra large and it fit great but for a fuller size gal like myself, the higher waist line made me look kind of preggers. I am a size 14 with a d cup, and I ordered a size up per the reviews saying it runs small. Just not for me."
4.0,"I typically wear a small in tops, I have a 32a bust, 26 inch waist,and 38 in hips. I looked at the size chart and decided on a medium as in a lot of Asian produced clothing I need to size up. This is a dress you need to size down in.<br />I'm swimming in the medium. It measures roughly 20 inches pit to pit, 15 inches across the waist unstreched, and it can stretch to about 20 plus inches.<br />The material is soft and stretchy. The style is exactly as expected, but it just fits big."
4.0,"This is one of her nicest charms. For the money, it's amazing."
4.0,Got a 2x fit great
4.0,"Cute tutu but, my Gosh, it STINKS! I had to let it air out for a few days before I was able to try it on just bc of the smell. Other than that, it fits true to size and is pretty cute!"
4.0,Granddaughter loves these. Keeps her feet warm. Doesn't slip
4.0,"Really a great bargain. It looks great with fur, really adorable with my polar bear coat! Can't believe you can get it for 50% off!"
4.0,Hubby used this to create a Halloween donkey costume.  Served the purpose well.
4.0,Super cute exactly as picture but I only received four of each of the acrylic butterfly  charms.
4.0,"I first ordered a medium, which hung all wrong.  Returned that and got a small.  Fits perfectly, love it.  Very classy."
4.0,"Good, quality shirt for the price. Just ran a little bigger than I thought."
4.0,"I liked everything about this sports bra except for that the padded cups. There was too much padding in the cups . I will use this sports bra while stand up paddle boarding. I like the support, but don't really need that much padding."
4.0,Pretty dress. It'll be fine for our son's wedding. I needed a size smaller but none were available so will have to take it in.
4.0,Nice... Brought wrong ones for current watch... But it works great with my older one... It's a win win...
4.0,Satisfied with the purchase made
4.0,Moyabo sleeveless dress.  Adorable dress with a very pretty navy and white print.  I ordered a size large and it fit correctly. My daughter is 5'6 155lbs and a 36DD chest.  The dress came to her knees and fit nicely.  The material is stretchy and silky. The print messages the dress either casual with a pair of sandals or dressy with jewelry and heels.  Great versatile dress.
4.0,"While this pair of sunglasses was finally what I have been looking for, it's not without it's faults.  I've had them for a couple weeks and wear them daily, but am still getting used to a coup[le things.  FIrst, though my head is wide, I guess my ears are short, meaning that the ear pieces are much too long for my head and aren't all that comfortable around the ears. So far its a bit of a tradeoff for the comfort of wider set.  I also had to get a set of nose pieces b/c the bridge was too wide for my nose, but that was minor.  Overall, I will stick with them, as the price was right."
4.0,"cute glasses, not exactly how i pictured them"
4.0,Broke the second time I wore it😕<br /><br />Edit...necklace was replaced at no charge
4.0,Fits great and very comfortable.  Just had to add a few stitches in the front so it wouldn't fly open.
4.0,"It is very see through on the bottoms, especially when in motion"
4.0,"A little large, could use more padding in the elbow/ forearm area. Great looking kit at an outstanding price!"
4.0,"They look just like the picture, thought they’d be a little bit more comfortable. Still cute!"
4.0,"Not top quality, but they're pretty good. I bought a batman set for my guy and it was absolutely terrible, threads pulling out of every seam. They're pretty lightweight overall and he loves them. He'll run around shooting invisible webs and making noises when he wears them. My son is 3 1/2 for reference."
4.0,"Really cute and comfy, not the highest quality, had some loose threads, but for the price I can't complain. I am 5'10&#34; and it was shorter than I hoped, (4 or 5 inches above the knee) but I had expected that given my height."
4.0,"I like it! the pockets are a little weird and the butt hangs down very low, but overall it is form fitting and very comfy, very cute, and i will wear it a lot in the summer :)"
4.0,"I purchased 2 for a musical. One child stated it was kind of itchy, but both worked well and fit well. No issues with shoulder fall-downs or tightness in the middle area. I would recommend for dances and performances."
4.0,Fits vey well. My waist is a 30 and I purchased a tag size medium and they fit wonderful.
4.0,"No me<br />agrado que muy corto se sintura y yo soy alta,"
4.0,runs small....order 1 size up.... I'm 115lbs usually wear size S...but i have to returned and ordered M ...which fit but still a little tight.
4.0,It's incredible but it smells bad from the inks on the hood. I hope it comes out with water and soap.
4.0,I love this dress! I was nervous because sometimes dresses like these make me look too boxy or are too long. But this fit just right! I’m 5’2 and it’s about two inches above the knee. Only CON is that it did come with a small cut in the fabric on the back
4.0,Great pants! Very airy and stylish. Only reason I hadn't given it a 5 is because the material wrinkles super easy and makes traveling with them a tiny bit inconvenient.
4.0,"Bought this for my daughter's daddy & me dance. This dress is well constructed, but really long. Instead of trimming and hemming the length, I basically hemmed it up sort of like Roman shade style.  I was pleased to have found the flower pinned instead of sewn in. The most important thing, she loves it!"
4.0,Firm support without cutting off my circulation at the top of the sock. Good to wear all day
4.0,Nice quality and versatile
4.0,"These look really good. Wearing them for a masquerade ball. The mans mask is made of a stiff plastic, and runs a bit small. The ladies mask is more flexible."
4.0,Got for my wife as a little ‘just because” gift and she loved them. They are comfy and real good material. Her only complaint is they might be a tad bit small but not enough to not wear them. She actually wears them with her dress slacks to work!
4.0,This is a really good size and my son received it for a birthday present and loves it
4.0,"It fit a bit small but that's my fault, in reading the reviews I should of ordered a bigger size but I'm being optimistic in that I'll fit into it soon. 😉Other than that I like the support it provides."
4.0,Runs big.  Very comfortable but the straps are poorly designed.
4.0,"Loved the dress! Wore it for a sorority event & it looked amazing.<br />I usually wear and XL but this one was sooo big, definitely could have gotten an L. If you look at the second picture you can see where the excess folds over.<br />I’m currently returning it to get it in a size L & in the pink."
4.0,"Nice watch, color doesn't match (more brown in color), and very big so most likely you will need to remove some links."
4.0,"The rust/orange color which is very pretty, Not too vibrant or cheap looking .<br /><br />just adorable and slims me down. I am 5'2 and 155. size large which fits nicely."
4.0,"The fabric is very thin, & the pads aren't completely sewn to the fabric, so I have to fix 'em everytime I wash it, & 1 of the straps was messed up, so I had to fix it."
4.0,Really Cute. But a little smaller than expected.
4.0,"my grand daughter love these, i would not recommend for every day wear due to the  design of the shoe, after 3 mos of constant wearing my grand daughter ended up shredding the wiring"
4.0,Super cute. Only downside is that it wrinkles easily. But I love how it fits. I feel like the pink one is longer than the others.
4.0,Very beautiful but Runs Small
4.0,"Very nice dress. I was late in making this dress for a function I had. It was on prime so it would make it to me on time. However, the dress came later than I was expecting. I have to revert to something else . I was so disappointed."
4.0,"Great product! Very comfortable in the pocket. Not able to find the hidden cash slot that another buyer commented on. No instructions or documentation for the use of the screwdriver or any other feature, thus the 1 star drop."
4.0,Son resistentes y de buen material
4.0,"This scarf/mask combo is not bad for the price.  The pattern and colors are good.  The only negative for me, is that the scarf is not very long in length.  You have to tie it behind your neck in order to wear it as a fashion scarf.  Because the length is short it does not hang/drape how I would prefer.  It does look nice and serves it's purpose."
4.0,Cover ears while walking the dog
4.0,"I wear an 8/10 or M/L. I bought the orange short sleeve dress in a Large. The dress fits great everywhere but the sleeves. They are shorter than the pictures show and are a tad tight. They are above the elbow and not 3/4 as shown. I'm 5'4&#34; and the length is perfect. I'm keeping the dress because I absolutely love the slinky, lightweight fabric, the color, the length (hits just above the floor) and the fit. The only thing I don't like is the sleeve length that is shorter than pictured."
4.0,I'm new to the trinkets for the bracelets (Pandora collections) but have always believed in guardian angels. This little lady is beautiful in detail that has created her.  A beautiful addition to any ones collection of trinkets on their wrists.
4.0,"Well made and soft, would purchase again."
4.0,"these are reasonably priced, quickly shipped goggles.  the multiple lenses are a nice touch, and they are a great value for their price. im glad i got them."
4.0,"The leggings are very soft, comfortable, thick enough to not see through yet thin enough to wear in the fall. I'm a size 1-3 and these were slightly too big. Will try to shrink them a bit to have them fit better. Overall, happy with the purchase."
4.0,"Not particularly fancy and I'm sure not protective, but stylish and accurate to description. Actually love the design. It does catch your hair though"
4.0,So far they are working well. Quality seems decent.
4.0,Love the colors and the ease of an elastic strap as well as no buckle under my wrist. I took away a star because they lose their stretch and I am at the point on the two I have worn where I can’t adjust them any tighter. But there are four and the price isn’t outrageous so they’re worth it.
4.0,"This watch is not too fancy, but it is servicable."
4.0,Looks like the photo. My brother's girlfriend loves them!!
4.0,Beautiful dress fits like a very sexy sophisticated glove 😜I'm a size 10  bought a large it's like it was made for me
4.0,Its really big but I've gotten a lot of complements also its losing its color already
4.0,Feels nice on. I like the artistic pattern
4.0,Was a gift for someone for Christmas. She loves pigs and cozy things. Says she loves them! BUT they shed little pieces of fabric from the inside. Only downside from what I’ve herd.
4.0,"This pendant and necklace is very tiny.  Other than that, it still looks good.  A good side-gift for a close loved one."
4.0,I brought it as a gift. The receiver was well pleased.
4.0,"Fit well, arrived on time. Happy with purchase"
4.0,Turned out to be that &#34;soft&#34; fabric that is so popular now but I really prefer the heavier weight cotton shirts.
4.0,bought this to replace my wife's watch band I bought her for christmas looks and works great!
4.0,"nice color, but top a bit smaller than expected .  I'm 5'5&#34; 138 lb wear M-L tops  so ordered L, but was snug."
4.0,I reviewed this earlier and was happy it fit.  I wore it a couple of days and it doesn’t stay in place.  Very frustrating. I discarded it and gave up on the waist trainer game.
4.0,"I bought this top in the blue, pink and white I loved it so much. I may have been able to go with a smaller size but I don t know that they had them..the colors are vivid. I've had a lot of compliments on them..."
4.0,"Great material, made well but medium should be considered small."
4.0,Great oversized sweater!
4.0,"Cute shirt.  Doesnt have off the shoulder as much as I wanted.. I kept having to pull it down.  But over all, its cute.  I should have gotten a size smaller."
4.0,I thought the square slit on the the side was on both sides<br />It’s just one side<br />And i have a small waist with thick muscular thighs so the large fits really good at the top but tends to stretch after wearing it<br /><br />It will definitely look better with dark stockings and it has close to a suede material
4.0,It fits great and I know I will be wearing this a lot.
4.0,"Nice pendant. Chain is too short to put over your head. I had ordered this for someone who was in the Army for 14 years, but he didn't reply to my messages that it arrived. I gave it to my boyfriend. He loves it & said the chain isn't too short to wear it comfortably. I'll update with the exact measurements when he takes it off. Please keep in mind that the ball chain is the same chain used in bathtub drains & ceiling fan pulls, but don't let that keep you from buying this. The loop on the pendant is quite large & can accommodate many other chains or cords. I don't know if it will chip or turn his skin green yet. It's a bit pricey with the ugly chain, but we love the pendant. I recommend this for men, not ladies, only because the pendant is heavy, but I highly recommend it for anyone that plays the GTA series of games because you get to throw hand grenades & you get stars when the police are chasing you lol.<br />I also recommend it for anyone that is or was in the Army because I did a search for Army symbols & Army jewelry & this is the only one that I liked.<br />It arrived in a small zip baggie with the pendant beside, not on the chain, inside a square bubble lined white envelope approximately 6&#34; x 6&#34;. Much faster than several other companies in China."
4.0,Great head piece for the price. Be prepared to have to adjust a lot to get it the mesh where you want it. The clip is really good and think I won't be having any issues with it sliding around much. I'd recommend this seller.
4.0,The hat is awesome but the dress is one size smaller than what is indicated
4.0,This bag is great for the price. Size is just right. The only thing I am wary about is the material. From my experience I think it will start to peel. Hoping it doesn't.
4.0,I wear US size 9 and this were kind small :( too tight . But they great for flats with open sides.
4.0,Makes her sweet legs a little bit sweeter
4.0,Nice well-made but very small
4.0,"These pants would be good for running or other activities in wet warm weather, especially if you are short and stocky. Unfortunately they don’t have any waist size less than 30”, so the 30x32 size I tried because it was the closest to my size was too flabby around the waist. The waist is elastic but it didn’t even get stretched and in fact left some room to insert a couple fingers.<br /><br />The 32” inseam is barely 32” and feels a bit high-water especially since they are also loose around the ankles, which doesn’t make for a flattering look, especially for runners for which this product is advertised.<br /><br />They are thin though not necessarily light in weight. The material seems waterproof though I never tried it outside at all, leave alone in the rain, but pouring water on the fabric does bead up and roll away.<br /><br />I can’t for the life of me understand why no one seems to make slim fit water-resistant wet summer joggers or pants with a long enough inseam."
4.0,Good riding glasses for the money. Only complaint is they let a little too much air come in around your eyes but I got used to it.
4.0,"Fits well,  gives great support."
4.0,"Just what I wanted. They fit great, and look good underneath clothes-- they look ok even if they peek through some tops.  They don't make my &#34;back fat&#34; look so obvious...!"
4.0,"The bag was just as described. It is a soft leather and for the price I am amazed at how nice it is. The only thing that bothers me is that it doesn't stand on its own because it's soft. I have my Lenovo 13&#34; Yoga laptop, laptop charger, 3 letter size notebooks and 2 small notebook and there is still a bit of.room to spare.  With all this inside I can still zip the bag closed for added security (see picture). The color is beautiful. You can't go wrong with this bag."
4.0,"These are a little thinner than I'd like. They're comfortable and they are low cut like I like. They seem to fit well and are a soft pink color.<br /><br />Since I've gone to the other side and decided to start wearing skinny jeans I've discovered that you can't just go ahead and wear any ol' sock. You actually have to get the low cut ones or you look like someone I dressed. It was not pretty. I was wearing low sneakers and higher socks, so all you saw was sock. It was not pretty. Luckily, these are  here to save the day."
4.0,Came as described but the bow isn’t tied. So I have to figure out how to tie it. It is larger than I thought it would be. But the detail in it is beautiful.
4.0,the kid is very happy
4.0,Cute but probably couldve got for cheaper somewhere else
4.0,Bought these in 3-6 month and they're huge... I'd imagine they'll fit my daughter closer to age 1-1.5. That being said they're adorable. I'm in love with Freshly Picked moccasins but can't afford the price tag. These were great and shipped super fast. Just order a size down.
4.0,"It's cute, but the arms are a little too tight for me"
4.0,Nice watch great price waterproof and sturdy so far I've had it for a month I work with about of water and is definitely waterproof.
4.0,"The top itself is really cute, flattering. You can adjust the waist tie. But the camisole that came with it is awful, short and just bad. I wore a regular tank top underneath it. Not sure it's worth the price for a see through top that you need to get your own camisole for, but it's cute."
4.0,I love the style and the way it fits for the most part! I little big at the waist!
4.0,I would have given this bag 5 stars because I really loved it and was satisfied with its quality. I was pleased with just about everything however because of the magnetic closure it refuses to stay close and pops open each time I close it. It is however a very classy and elegant bag. Just wish it would stay close.
4.0,"My son loves among us. He loves the mask. The only part he doesn’t like is that it is silk on the inner part which makes around your nose, mouth sweat."
4.0,"Suprisingly really like this dress!  The mater is okay and pretty breezy for the summer.  The ties on top are cute and adjustable.  The only thing I didn't like about it was the length, it was a little long for me and I am 5""8.  But the dress did shrink and now its perfect, especially paired with a cute white tee under it.  Would recommend to size up as it will shrink."
4.0,Over all the dress fit was good. The skirt was a little too wide. I bought an XL and I am a 5’ 3” person about 175 pounds
4.0,"I love this bracelet.  It's not quite as pastel in color, it's a little more earth tones, but it is really nicely made and it feels good when I'm wearing it."
4.0,Used for a Halloween costume and it worked perfect.
4.0,I love my owl bracelet. It fit wells. The bracelet woven part is good and sturdy. The hardest part you have to be careful not to hit and catch the owl on items or things because it can disconnect. The piece is right and it adorable.
4.0,Enjoyed wearing this set! Very stretchy and comfortable. I'm a size 12 and had room in the large.
4.0,The other reviewers were right these shirts do fit a little tight. I will get more as they are very comfortable and higher quality than Hanes or Fruit of the Loom. I normally wear a medium but will get a large and likely will fit just right. Nice shirts at a good price.
4.0,It’s cute but light. Sleeves are a little bit short but okey for me. I generally love the purchase.
4.0,"As other reviews have stated, this is not a push up bra.  It's just a sheer mesh and lace.  I also has underwire. In that sense, it does help to hold ones breasts and the lace will pull up some what.  That being said, it is very very cute lace bra.  Don't buy it for the push up, but definitely go for it if you like cute lace.<br /><br />I usually wear 34A.  But like most Chinese bras, this one runs small.  I have to use the last set of hooks and it's still a little tight.  The material does not stretch much, but it's comfortable.  Took about 3 weeks to get here.  But since I don't have any bra emergency, I am ok with the wait.<br /><br />Update:  After owning this for a few weeks and having worn this bra full day several times, I took a star off for the tightness.  I have other Etosell bras and they are not this small.  Still, I would continue to wear this one and like it very much.  It's so very cute.  I will buy this bra again, but I might have to buy the next band size."
4.0,We love the bathing suit but the sizes are really odd.  I got this for my 14 year old daughter and there is only one size for both pieces.  The bottoms fit but the top was way to big for her.  I did order another one though and will probably give this one to my niece
4.0,"When you purchase this product, buy the next size up. Very tight around the calf, difficult to put on the first time."
4.0,"Looks amazing for about the first month or so, but then it begins getting noticeably discolored. If your buying it as an accessory for cosplay, it`s amazing, but if you plan to wear it a lot, it wont last very long. I enjoyed it while it lasted, but to each their own I suppose."
4.0,The shirt is okay. The neck feels high and the arm holes are very low. The material is this but it’s a good workout shirt for the price.
4.0,They were a little larger than I expected but very cute!
4.0,I ordered this dress in the navy blue. I ordered it a size bigger than I normally wear and it fit really well. I think it will be really nice for Ren Faire this year. It shipped quickly which is always nice.
4.0,I love the idea and really wanted these to work for both reading off the page and the computer.  They kinda help with the computer screen and are a little blurry as reading glasses.  Maybe more of a slight distortion/color aberration when trying to read off paper.  Frames seem very good quality and have held up well so far.
4.0,"Borderline small. The strap is kinda tight putting it on but fits fine. Just a bit more stretchy would be nice. And for length, order a size larger."
4.0,"Fit well, they rise down a bit though so watch out when wearing them in public!"
4.0,"It fits ok I would prefer it to be a tad bit longer, but it gets the job done"
4.0,"Meets mask requirements. Not very stretchy! Breathing through the thick fabric will make you feel like a corona-martyr, however!"
4.0,"My daughter loves it takes it everywhere with her! She loved the color and pattern, my suggestion is that u put some glitter in there somewheres girls love glitter! I like it because its a hard case."
4.0,The fit is super cute and comfy. True to size. I would purchase another.
4.0,This is a very cute earring. however it is a bit heavy for a child's ear. also the backing came loose from its mount but this could have been caused by the child. Over all its a great piece and I would order again.
4.0,Perfect shirt for long waisted person.<br />Good thin shirt for layering.
4.0,"It's prettier in the picture than in person, but it's still pretty. Not as long as i thought it would be, but for 10.00 couldn't pass it up!"
4.0,"I loved this set,not to big or to small."
4.0,"Loved them,  I just ordered the wrong size. Great for my outfit though.  👍🏾"
4.0,"there was a musty smell to this when I first opened the package, but that has since gone away. I like it, but has been too cold to just wear this without a thick jacket outside and it doesn't really fit under a jacket."
4.0,Nothing special.  If will last a month would ne great
4.0,"This is such a cute bag for a low price! It's approximately 13Hx15W, which does line up with the measurements in the description! It's canvas with what appears to be a painted on decal. Overall, the bag portion appears well made. It has a small zipper pouch on the inside back which most purses have. My only compaint is the strap. It has a few loose strings, and it's a fake leather (not that I expected it to be real leather at all, but it does say that in the description). The strap arrived sort of kinked up from being packaged and I can't get it to lie flat. I'll probably have to sit something heavy on the strap to flatten it out, but overall it's not a bad bag!"
4.0,Shoes fit perfect and multiple settings and colors for lights. Good price
4.0,"It's a good watch at a fair price.  Light weight, stylish.  Fast shipping"
4.0,"The rings are pretty but the colored stone is crooked and has a painted gold backing, which is noticeable. I would have preferred any CZ, glass or lab stone. But it's ok if not looking closely.  The clear stone is nice. I love the sideways orientation of the stone. I've been wearing it 2 days and no green yet. But again... these were 56 cents plus shipping. Not expecting miracles here. I got size 10. Good fit."
4.0,"My wife is cold all the time. With this sweater, she can be comfortable. She wears it all the time it seems like."
4.0,these are so cute with open toed sandels...add a little bit of dressiness to plain pair of shoes...bought a pair for my daughter also and she loves them for work
4.0,The dress is cute. The quality is ok. It fit kinda tight around the arms.
4.0,"This dress is beautiful! However, it’s a lot thicker, larger and longer than I expected. I’m 149Lbs, 5’5 and I ordered a medium. I suggest that you order a size down."
4.0,"Super nice and comfortable, just if you get a little food grees on them it  won’t come of."
4.0,"I read a few reviews on here that said these were sized perfectly, so I felt confident ordering my normal M. I will need to return and reorder a L. Just too snug. Super cute though!"
4.0,perfect for inside &#34;house&#34; shoe
4.0,"Arrived earlier than expected. Fit perfectly and felt super comfy. Except that it does not have that pink strip on the bottom hem like it shows in the pic so a bit misleading. Other than that though, I like it and can't wait for cooler weather so I can wear it."
4.0,"It is as shown, the fabric is not too thin, not too bulky.  I bought it to wear when traveling overseas.  The hood is bit too small ….for me. But all else is ok. Bought green in M and the sleeve length is perfect for me.to the wrist I’m 5’6 . The length is about 4” below my knee. I would buy it again and I would recommend it."
4.0,Very comfortable. Used them for a costume but will be continuing to use for everyday wear
4.0,This item is nice simple and classy. Great for work. Especially if you work in the medical field simplicity is bliss
4.0,"Light, fit well, need some adjustments to get the straps to fit correctly."
4.0,Lace is a little thin
4.0,They are really cute! They are a little more snug than the other Nike compression shorts I have in the same size but probably because I've worn the other ones out. I also expected them to be more of a lime green like in the picture but they are definitely more yellow. I don't mind too much but I had gotten them because of the green color so it was a little disappointing. Luckily I still love them
4.0,"The wand itself is flat, which is sad because it would have been amazing if it was rounded. I decided to buy this wand as a base for my fairy godmother costume for a musical. So far it's pretty sturdy, it hasn't fallen apart. The little centre picture/plastic is held on with a zip-strip, which is odd, but that's okay since I plan on taking that part off and putting a gem there.<br />The only thing I'm worried about is if the top &#34;shell-like&#34; thing, it might be flimsy. Mine doesn't seem to be yet, but I'm still very cautious.<br /> All in all it has a perfect length and the centre is pretty solid."
4.0,"My 18 year old daughter loves it!  Her only complaint is that to wear the thumb holes puts pressure on her hands-the sleeves are a little too short to make that comfortable. Otherwise, a total hit!"
4.0,I look forward to my baby being able to wear this when she grows into it. It is such a nice dress. Well made and adorable....just too big.
4.0,Sizes run small. Material is very thin.
4.0,I got the size that the chart told me to buy from the measurements but the jacket was too small. The chart is not like the American size chart. I had get a bigger size. If your child is taller that average size then this product wouldn't be good for you. It is short so you would have to get at least 3 times your child's size. The seller was very nice and sent the size I needed for my son. When I got it the material was very soft it didn't feel cheap and he was able to wear it when it rained and it kept him dry. Overall a very good product.
4.0,Shirt was true to size. Felt nice. Gave it as a gift and they seemed to like it.
4.0,Love this wallet so far! Prefect size and amount of space for credit cards!!
4.0,Very nice lightweight gi. Fits very good and durable.  Hope to see more gi in the lineup soon!
4.0,Took both my daughters a little while to figure how to get in on but once they figured it out it what exactly what my younger daughter wanted for cosplay.
4.0,I bought 2 of the AuntTaylor Cardigans on fit perfect but this one was somewhat large...
4.0,Nice blouse but wrong color. I ordered another one
4.0,quedan muy bien y a la medida
4.0,"I honestly hadn’t expected much from this band when I bought it, and yet it managed to replace the OEM band that came with the Polar Unite.<br /><br />While I liked the innovative clasp on the OEM band, the material did not breathe or flex very well. This resulted in rashes and irritation, despite regular cleaning. This band does not cause those. It has a more conventional metal, hinged watch clasp, which does work, but isn’t as fancy. The material stretches to accommodate movement far better and doesn’t slide around at the same time, which can be really nice during climbs and at work.<br /><br />The holes make this band very breathable and easy to wear all day, and it’s easy to keep clean...I can slip it off easily and hand wash at any point during the day, and it’s usually dry again very quickly, even if I don’t get it completely dry before putting back on.<br /><br />I intend to get the same strap in other colors at this point. It would be nice if slightly wider but with the same 20mm hinge, but I really can’t complain."
4.0,"Adorable! I was a little confused and disappointed at the lack of frills on the bottom of my daughter’s dress, but she’s happy, so that’s all that matters! Very cute!"
4.0,Very cute. Not for large busts though!
4.0,"A snug fit. Order one size up if ur a little thick, if you're petite, order your size. Cute shirt!"
4.0,I had to return the first pair I received because the box was squished (probably in transit) and the lens had a scratch.  The second pair I got as a replacement looks fine; I like the color and shape of the sunglasses and they look good on.  I'll update this review and add more to it once I've worn them for a while to report about sturdiness and if they last enough.
4.0,The band should be offered in two sizes. still works great.
4.0,I love these glasses for their looks and comfort. The lenses are the right size for me to read through versus those tiny lenses you get with some reading glasses. Have received many compliments about their looks. And I love the weight of these glasses. They aren’t flimsy.
4.0,Cheap and effective
4.0,"Quality is much better than I expected. We ordered a small.  The top is probably best for B cup sizes and above, the bottoms were really cute, a great fit and matched other tops nicely. Well constructed and fast shipping."
4.0,Dthese gloves work for freezer work? I work at Whole Foods in the frozen department looking for warm gloves.
4.0,Love buying my wife pretty things and she looks great in this dress.
4.0,"Good, solid strap. Leather construction and stitching is of good quality for every day field work. Installation was simple. The large buckle is a bit too big for my taste but it is hardly a flaw since I do not spend all my time looking at that side of the watch once it is on."
4.0,"I bought this in small and I'm 5'2, 126lbs and 34-26-37. The dress, on me, stops below the knee.<br />Pros:<br />Form fitting as in Please be fit or happy with your body because the material is thin and not forgiving.<br />- I'm not a fan of the long sleeves and would love this if it were 3/4 sleeves instead<br /><br />Cons:<br />The top of this dress is a bit baggy in the boob department so I'm going to sew it so it will no longer be an extreme deep v."
4.0,Nothing bad to say about this out fit only thing is the bra is on the little side like only cover your nipples little lol but that can be covered up with the jacket other then that nice buy
4.0,Love the green color. Length hits me about 6 inches above the ankle. Not see through at all! Love the built in slip.
4.0,LOVE the way it looks but it is sheer. Also had difficulty finding a shirt to go with it but found one and it is cute! happy with purchase.
4.0,Not the warmest but a value for the price
4.0,"nice color, am a woman and the fit is tight on my head"
4.0,"Good material. Bright, pretty colors. Fit was right. Nice suit."
4.0,Es lo esperado en cuanto a color. Pero tiene una tela debajo que da un poco de calor. En tamaño llegó como esperaba S
4.0,Looked good on. I gave a 4/5 because the waist band will just not stay flat- keeps twisting. Annoying. Good for is talle ladies. Im 6 feet and it went to my feet. Need heels or it drags the floor. Overall good buy.
4.0,"Love 'em! I always have lower back pain and after using these socks it has helped out a lot! The only thing is the first pack I ordered were thicker and made shoes a little more comfortable but other than that, I still notice a BIG difference than regular socks."
4.0,"Fits fine. Seems a little thin and that it might not hold up, but it was great for a short-term dance class for my 5-year-old girl."
4.0,Keeps my neck warm as well as providing mask feature.  I have doubled it and sewn in a nose piece to help hole it in place.  It was OK in the summer but Iwouldn't exactly say it was cooling.
4.0,"Very nice wallet, it's slim so it can really go with any type of purse. My only complaint is the image shows that it can keep your checks and credit cards, but if you put your checks in the area it shows the wallet won't close. Not that big of a deal to me since it's in my purse so I don't care if it fully closes but it might be a problem for other people."
4.0,Went to a gala and it was perfect. Had to take it to get the split higher (my preference) but overall I was pleased with the fit. I am 5’7 189 lbs and usually wear between 12-14. I ordered a size 14 and it fit good.
4.0,"These seem like good quality.  Using the information provided, I hoped they would be large enough for my husband.  He is 6 ft. and 190 pounds.  They are too small for him, but I plan on using to snorkel in Hawaii, as they fit me well.  I am 5' 5&#34; and weigh 135 pounds."
4.0,"I just go these in the mail, very cute and a good size for work"
4.0,Its was very easy to install in my Asus Zenwatch 2 and feels comfortable to use
4.0,Got this for my dad and he really liked it!
4.0,I ordered a medium but it was a size too big. It still fits comfortable though with it being bigger. I know next time to order a small instead.
4.0,Product quality was great however the sizes run very small
4.0,The band fits really well and soft. It doesn't get sticky when working out.
4.0,Larger than most of same size
4.0,It fit my son perfect!
4.0,"I like the top overall. It is flattering in the tummy area, and covers my wobbly upper arms."
4.0,Comfortable dress for casual wear.
4.0,"I have been using shirt tuck stays that attach to my thighs for a year or so now and the drawbacks were so numerous I went searching for other options. I recently tried the CROPAL Men's Shirt Stays Underwear Non-slip Adjustable Elastic Cotton Boxer Brief and I am very happy with it so far. The briefs are comfortable and fit well without being too tight. The shirt holder works as described adding minimal bulk to my waistline. However, the elastic band does not hold my shirt as well as my old shirt stays. Never-the-less its still better than just using a belt and I would recommend you give it a try as your mile may vary. 4/5 stars."
4.0,Exactly what I ordered. They are not meant for people with small hands. Besides that they are very nice
4.0,Navy capris ran larger than expected and were slightly see through.  I sent them back and ordered another color. I love the navy and hope they make the fabric a little denser. Same thing happened with black - they seem slightly thinner than my other black ones.
4.0,These gloves are so warm. The touch screen fingers do not work (reason I gave a 4 instead of a 5). Very warm though.
4.0,"This is a very solidly-made watch from what I can tell so far.  I've had this about a week.<br /><br />The weight is just right.  It fit just right for me - usually men's watches with the clasp band hang loosely but this one is a good fit.  I am about 5'6&#34;, 175 lb so I'm a little smaller than the average American male.<br /><br />I don't have the same issue as others regarding the date not changing on its own.  So far the timekeeping is on track - I saw a one-star review stating the watch lost time.  So far so good here.  The seller/distributor may make a difference.  I selected the watch sold directly from Voeons.<br /><br />The watch is definitely glossy - more so than what it looks like on the photo.  I took photos and the glossiness doesn't show up in those photos either.  That's ok with me but if you're looking for a matte finish, this is not that.<br /><br />If I run across any issues with the band pins or holder breaking with use (as others have reported) I'll update this review."
4.0,"I wanted a mask that was a little different This one is cute, and more interesting than a solid color mask. The only issue is it’s  a little more work to adjust on your face.  I really like that it’s adjustable."
4.0,"Some pilling, slightly more than expected. Very smooth fabric, almost spandex-y. Love the way the stitching flatters. I do have to pull these back up throughout the time I'm wearing them (around the house; haven't used them for a workout)."
4.0,Loved it!! It's super cute and simple. Took a little longer to get here but it was worth the wait.
4.0,I’m 5’2 at 118lbs and I ordered a medium because I was concerned it would fit too small. I wore and it the medium was a bit bigger than expected but it’m turned out to be great. Nice blouse and nice detail. I am going to have to take it in though.
4.0,"I bought this as a gift for my guy to celebrate a new job. It fits the 16&#34; laptop it needed to fit, plus a few books, pads, pens, name tag, etc. The 2 front pockets are really nice additional space. He loves the way the bag buckles closed because you can a strap it like a belt OR use the spring clasps. He had a different bag before with a body strap that kept coming open and making him drop the bag, this one doesn't do that. The only thing I didn't like about this purchase it's that I initially ordered the darker color and paid for one day shipping, but my confirmation email estimated a delivery date for the following week, like 4 or 5 days later with no explaination. I had to call Amazon to figure out what the deal was to find out that the color I wanted was out of stock. I decided to go with the lighter color instead to get it the next day, but I'm glad I did because it showed up on time and my guy loves it!"
4.0,Fits well to length but the slit on the sides is a little high...shows a little cheek if I lift my arms up. So will have to make alterations to the garment.
4.0,She wore it and looked adorable.
4.0,I've used my skirt for Zumba class and goofing off around the house.  I've probably used it 25 times.  I've lost a few beads/coins.  I didn't pay much for the skirt so I guess I can't complain too much.  Plus we sling it pretty hard in zumba.  If I took the time I could try to reinforce and re-attch some of the beads that fell off.  The material is pretty sheer so I'm not sure how much reinforcing it could withstand.  Still love my skirt and it has great jingle sound.  I also like that the skirt/scarf is longer than some of the others so it will cover your bottom nicely if you tie it in the front.
4.0,it was worth the price i paid and i received it quickly
4.0,"needed a larger size, reordered and chose a different color, too.  It was a bit drab."
4.0,"These worked out great for my superhero day with my students. However, beware they are kinds see through. I wore regular leggings underneath. They were very stretchy and comfortable though so it was not an issue!"
4.0,"I ordered this shirt in pink. The color is more like beige and brown and looks a bit washed out. That's why I didn't give it 5 stars. Maybe the other colors will be more appealing. Otherwise, the shirt is nice and very comfortable. It's oversized so it will feel great on a hot summer day. Seems to be made well and easy to wear."
4.0,both bands fit great 👍
4.0,Bought this for my 16 year old daughter. She loves it.
4.0,I love this ring! My only con for giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is that the little diamonds scratch against your other fingers.  I get tons of compliments on this ring though! Beautiful`
4.0,"This dress is beautiful! There is a little bit more cleavage showing than I would have liked, but that was easily remedied by the right bra. The dress, however, is REALLY long. Even with 4 inch heels (and I'm 5'6&#34;), it was hard to walk without holding it up. I'm a size 12/14 and I ordered an XL and it fit around perfectly. Sleeve length was perfect. Great dress!"
4.0,"Sleeves were just a hair too short, but the shirt can pull that off"
4.0,Nice and supple.
4.0,Perfect jacket but wrong color
4.0,"Very comfortable. I got a size medium, it fits perfect but if you want to wear something under it I would get a size larger."
4.0,"This bag is great, perfect for work. I only gave it four stars because it is a lot smaller than I expected but it is very sturdy and stands on its own. Very neat and professional looking. I got it in black."
4.0,Cute but plastic tears & breaks easily.
4.0,"This is a very nice tie for the money and would get 5 stars if it didn't have a few minor dents from packing/shipping. Luckily, I can cover the largest dent with a tie clip. My tie was jostled around in a box with a large, heavy book without any packing material. The damage could have been eliminated or reduced with an air pack. Maybe rolling them would work. Apparently, this is a consistent issue, so Amazon/The Tie Bar is going to have to figure something out."
4.0,"Not as well made as my husband's first pair of this brand. Pockets are less functional.<br />However, fit is consistent with his other pair."
4.0,I am. Sometimes I take a chance buying clothes for my wife. I know her size and generally what she likes. Buying clothes online before xmas is different. But this worked out OK. She looks extra hot wearing this.
4.0,Ordered this in white for my daughter for her graduation. The back and bust are almost completely see thru. Still struggling to find a slip for it. The fit and quality though are great… just wouldn’t recommend white.
4.0,"Super cute, but a touch too small for a 34D. Rides up under the bust on me. Would be super cute on someone leaner."
4.0,My daughter is 7 and I bought large fit her perfect.
4.0,"Material feels soft and stretchy, my daughter wears a 6/7 (6yrs old), ordered the L based on reviews. The length fits her body good but elastic around the inner thighs is very tight and she cant wear it. If I order up a size it will be too big. Will have to see if a seamstress can let it out or expand. Very pretty on though!"
4.0,"In Hawaii you need good sun protection, fast drying and wind protection. This does it all pretty well."
4.0,"I used this for the beach, worked great and no sunburn!"
4.0,The measurements are accurate even if they are cut smaller than usual but still not too small.  I ordered the pink gradient and it's such a lovely color and contrast.  I personally love the silky material and it wasn't as see through as others stated.  Perhaps it depends on the size and wearing the right colored bra.
4.0,"I ordered a Large based on the size chart. It fit perfectly. I am 5'6 and weigh 184lbs, and typically wear a 10-12 dress size and jeans size. The fabric is soft, not see through at all. Little heavier than I was expecting but not too heavy for a spring or fall dress. This dress didn't hit the floor on me, it comes right to my ankles so my shoes can be seen."
4.0,"I love this suit, except the legs are too long, I'm 5'4&#34;.  I going to have my seamstress hem them.  So it should work out okay."
4.0,Bought for a school at play. They are nice for the price. Except sometimes the a string from the belt comes loose and gets tangled up. But otherwise very nice.
4.0,good comfy to wear
4.0,it was cute but it kept squeezing me from the middle. i would get a bigger size
4.0,"Fun socks, have a couple of pairs as gifts."
4.0,Very colorful hoodie. Size runs a little small. My son normally wear a 12 husky so I ordered the XL size hoodie and it fits perfect.
4.0,My 13 y.o. daughter loved it! Good price!
4.0,These do help with my arch and heel. They are not very wide and I have a wide foot so they are a little short on the sides. Overall a good product for the price and very similar to much more expensive ones.
4.0,I just got it from my uniform
4.0,"I buy these on a regulars basis for use as a cat toy.  Since this item is hard to find I would recommend this item and the seller delivers pretty quickly.  I deducted one star because the sizes can very, I always receive a few in the pack that are small in size."
4.0,Like the warmth it gives but disappointed about the color  in the picture it seems much brighter I keep it anyway
4.0,Love this dress. Its stretchy & fits vary flattering. My only issue is that it is very short. I have a large bum & it is literally hanging out. But I love it so I am just going to get a pencil skirt to wear over.
4.0,"I really love this jacket, however the fake leather material on the arms came off after 2 uses! But I'm going to be covering the sleeves with patches so it's not a big deal."
4.0,I bought these earings for my daughter to attend school as she is only allowed to wear studs. She loves them and does not take them off even out of school. she says they make her feel pretty. So big thumbs up.
4.0,"Gets caught on a lot because of the design, but still beautiful. The girlfriend loves it"
4.0,I wish these came with no pattern - I'd buy a whole bunch more!  So glad though that one company has deemed it valuable to put grippies on tights!
4.0,"This is a really cute dress. The only problems I have is that if I were taller, it would be too short (I'm 5'2) and it is very tight in the chest area. If you're large chested, definitely size up 1-2 sizes"
4.0,Super comfy and fun. No complaints at all!
4.0,The product was average and the cloth is mediocre
4.0,I had so many compliments on this skirt. I ordered a size large and wore pettie coat underneath. Great material.
4.0,"Nice but too small, just order 1-2 sizes up!"
4.0,It's cute. The top fits my daughter the bottom is way too big. But I bought a bigger size for her so it deffinately will fit
4.0,6 pair for 5 bucks can't beat it
4.0,"It served it’s purpose. But I had to order an XX Large and I’m typically a Small.  52, weigh 115 pounds, 34D.  Otherwise it’s a typical T-shirt and the colors are vibrant. Not very soft but not excessively scratchy either."
4.0,Is a very nice robe for my grandson. He loves it. Fits great. Perfect for a little boy.
4.0,"I expected to be a little bit bigger, but it is cute so it's okay."
4.0,"I loved the top but it did run a tad bit small through the bustline. If I were going to buy it again, I would probably<br />size up if you are larger in the bustline. If you are wearing it as a dress, please remember it is going to rise up<br />quite a bit when you sit down. I wore it over leggings, and as a bathing suit cover up. Looked great!"
4.0,"This dress was great for a wedding. It was loose and flowy but didn’t look like a paper bag. It really is super flattering on the waist, I didn’t get a good picture because I was holding my baby the whole time but it looks great on. When I first got it, I was still nursing and couldn’t wear it because wayyy too much cleavage. Now that I’m not nursing, it fit perfect in the chest- I’m normally a 34 DD. I still wore a cami underneath to bring it up a bit because I am quite modest but overall it worked!"
4.0,"I like this dress but the material is not what I was expecting. Especially because I had planned on wearing it with a petticoat underneath. But because the material of the dress is so heavy it actually weighed down the petticoat and the skirt didn’t fluff up as desired. Other than that, I don’t really have any problems. The color was as expected (maroon/wine), the fit was as expected, I’m 5’7” and it came right to my knees, it was a little loose but that’s to be expected, I’m on the slimmer side so you either get a good fit in the length or in the chest/waist, it’s never both. But I’ve come to expect that by now. I like the dress enough though that I’ll have to find alternative measures to getting the skirt to fluff out. I still plan on wearing it."
4.0,Very cute and sexy two piece set. I gave it 4 stars in stead of five only because the arms are cut slim and when the material stretches you can see the white elastic stretching in the material. Otherwise I love it.
4.0,"I love these but are 2 inches too long. Im a 5'4"" female ."
4.0,The material is pretty weird and I was expecting it to be more coverage time but it’s basically just see through.I still love the shirt though!
4.0,Product is as advertized  and delivery was fast
4.0,All Vera Bradley bags are fantastic. The only reason I didn't give this a 5 Star is because I thought it would be a little wider. It is more narrow and deep. I really like the pattern and black and white colors because it really compliments so many outfits.
4.0,I really enjoy this keychain
4.0,Nice pink shirt<br />Soft and elegant
4.0,This is a very cute dress. Perfect for work!
4.0,Cute & no irritation I would recommend
4.0,The bra is made pretty well. The size of 36C doesn’t have as much space around the chest as most. 38 probably would fit better. Overall great buy. C cup is a perfect fit unlike some other bras.
4.0,"This was a great price for 2 capris. They look small coming out of the package, but they stretch nicely when put on. They are definitely not sheer as they stretch. When taken off they look stretched out; however, when washed they go right back to the original shape. There were a couple of  problems with them, but I was still pleased with the purchase for the price I paid. One, they shed a little the first time I wore them, not much but I did notice some. I haven't worn them after washing, so we'll see how it goes. The other problem is that they were longer than expected; however,  I am short. In the picture, they look like they are below the knee but above the calf. On me, they are on the lower calf. This will be no problem as the weather gets cooler, but they are a bit too long for the summer. Again, I am short, so if you are average in height they will be perfect in length."
4.0,I disliked the brand name so prominently stamped into the flap on the FRONT of this purse.<br />I used it when attending a wedding.<br />Leather was beautiful.<br />Quality good.<br />Just get rid of those large letters... ugh!
4.0,Good fit for my toddler. Doesnt slip off his foot. I would have rated 5 stars except theres no grip on the bottom and are very slippery. I wont let him wear them on the stairs.
4.0,"I bought this to complete my Halloween outfit as Cinderella. I received a lot of nice compliments and Gus assured a lot of laughs.<br />I have given four out of five as the purse part is so tiny that you can’t actually count on using it for anything but accessory - and maybe to bring money. But these days where we all bring at least our phones with us, and possibly car keys, I wish it would have been larger - as he is clearly large enough to have had a larger compartment! Regardless. It fulfilled its purpose and I am glad I bought it :)"
4.0,Nice band.  Fits the watch well and love that the hardware matches.
4.0,Shoes were just a little too small but she still had fun with the other extras & made her definitely feel like a princess on her birthday!
4.0,"Well not a whole lot to say about them, i got them for my fiance,  along with some other ""husker"" gear she is almost head to toe in husker gear now i would give it a 5, but to me they seem kinda, child like.  I guess for the price, and considering they are ""husker"" its not bad, but its just my thought. She loves them, and thats what matters."
4.0,Loved this swim suit but the reason I dropped a star is that it wore out quickly.  Made it most of the summer and we do have a pool so it got worn a lot.  Loved that it fit as it should've even with quite a big bust.  Will probably order again even knowing it won't last the entire summer.
4.0,"Took a few tries the first time to get it adjusted perfectly, frustrating because I had to take it off all the way to pull it back through.<br />They worked great, I bought 4. Love that I only need one for each bag."
4.0,"This is really cute. It fit well and looked great. My only worry is that it’s pretty thin, which is great for the heat right now but you can definitely see your underwear through it unless you’re wearing nude underwear."
4.0,I ordered the largest size they were a bit to small
4.0,Color was more of a burnt orange not bright orange. Still perfect for my orange color loving family member
4.0,They were gifts so I dont know how they really fit!!!!!!!!!
4.0,Liked it.bought it for birthday.
4.0,Great when you free nd a bra that's just a little tight. Very common comfortable.
4.0,Looks good in person
4.0,It’s lovely and easy to put on. Only negative is hands do not illuminate which was one of reasons I purchased it. It was a gift for my mother who likes to check her watch at night.
4.0,The gown is very comfortable to wear in the summer time and attractive too!
4.0,Loved suit but just a little looser than another speedo style size 8!!! But a great suit.
4.0,Too warm for Hawaii. Need less lining.
4.0,Wish they were a little softer and that I had ordered a size smaller  but they are fine
4.0,These pajamas are soft and cozy.  The top fits perfectly but the bottoms are a little short in the rise.
4.0,It good I just bought a size to small
4.0,"This is a very cute dress. I'm 5'7"" about 140lbs. It was a little too loose in the chest area for me. I gave it to my sister in law who is larger in the chest than me and it fit her perfectly."
4.0,"Pretty dress, with nice material, except the lace and buttons are kinda cheap."
4.0,These are a great value. Works well and the material is nice and thick.
4.0,This’s not a bad review I put this through hell and this’s all it happened I was in Mexico and I walk for mile with this and I know you’re not supposed to but I did and they work great !!!
4.0,Polarized lenses. Stylish and comfortable. Yes! Save your designer shades for that other occasion.
4.0,It's smaller than I thought but it holds everything I carry in a purse.
4.0,They were delivered early.  I love the way they fit.
4.0,"These looked great at first, but after being worn a few times, the gold is already fading. These are a little tricky to put on as you have to blindly get the stud in the little hole at the top of the flower. From now on I will probably just wear the gold stud by itself, which looks great alone anyway. So far the silver is holding up well."
4.0,"I am 5'5&#34; approx 135 lbs, long legs, small chest.  Was a bit big in the chest but not too tight on the tummy.  Highly recommended!!"
4.0,Very comfy - would definitely size up. Very firm fitting.
4.0,"I really like this shirt! The red color is exactly as the picture and the decal is as well. It also is put on well and has not faded -shirt or decal, through washes. I have hung it dry and don’t suggest using it in dryer. The top part is not as big and obviously off the shoulder as it looks in the picture. My only issue is this. So it looks odd if I put if off the shoulder, kinda like I’m trying too hard. Maybe, I just have to work the top a little more. Overall I would buy this over and over again!!! Nice fun, easy to clean, comfortable, quality shirt-especially for the PRICE!!!!!!"
4.0,"The plugs are comfortable, definitely not skin tone though - more like pale/semi-translucent pink."
4.0,I drive multiple vehicles as part of my job so I like to keep a bag on me of all the things I need small tools snacks and of course driving sun glasses.<br /><br />This little bag attaches right to the molle straps on my bag and seems to do a decent job protecting my cheap sunglasses. If you don’t have molle or just want to carry it different the clip seems half decent<br /><br />I only give it 4 stars because it’s not a very stiff case. It’s more than just a soft cloth case but less than a stiff foam case but perfectly adequate for sunglasses south of the 30$ price point<br /><br />I wouldnt recommend this case to carry your ray bans in under hard use but for me it’s perfect
4.0,"I was surprised they fit my large hands (6'4"", 210lbs) but they did. They are a bit stretchy so that helped. But they are comfortable. And seem decently well made. The one thing that could be better is the length - or how high they come up your wrists. If worn with a long sleeve shirt / grinch costume your wrists could be exposed when reaching outwards. Overall they are decent grinch gloves."
4.0,"Very attractive, ladylike dress for any day of the week.  Easy to care for and comfortable to wear.<br />Nicely made.  Fabric bleeds a little at first washing so be aware of that when laundering.<br />Flattering to most everyone."
4.0,"Very chunky and masculine.  It's heavy, as other reviewers mentioned, but not so bad that it feels like you're lifting weights. Rather, it feels very solid and substantial, which makes it's price point even more of a winner.  Only &#34;negative&#34; is that it's very shiny....I wish it were a little less chromed-out.  but that's personal preference. It's a great piece at a great price."
4.0,Very happy with this size 16 swimsuit purchase for a tall almost 12yo that usually wears a 14/16 in pants and a small women's (or occasionally a girl's 16) tops.  The fit was exactly as described.  The colors are pretty and help camouflage the chest area.  (FYI - There is no bra or extra padding.)  It has a modest cut overall and seems highly durable as expected from a Speedo suit.  Our only complaint is that it does not have the silicone grippers in the bottom that most of them have.
4.0,"Good quality shorts. Comfortable & stretchy fabric. Be aware, these a HIGH WAISTED. So make sure to note this before you purchase. The have a small pocket in the rear. Not too sure about getting a phone in there (maybe an older iPhone SE), but more likely credit card, cash, a key, etc.."
4.0,"Nice looking and slim, bought for Christmas gifts so hopefully the boys will like them."
4.0,Good enough!
4.0,Ok gloves for large hands
4.0,"Beautiful dress, however, if you have larger boobs, than I highly recommend going to a size large, even if you normally wear small, like I do.  I tried the small, couldn't even get it over 1 boob. I ended up ordering a large, and had no issues in the boob department. I ended up giving the small to a smaller chest friend of mine, she was very happy.  It is pretty sheer, on a side note."
4.0,Very happy! My Grandson is going to Disneyland and I wanted him to have a themed T-shirt to wear. I gave it to him as an Easter present and he loved it. It arrived before I expected and I was thankful for that.
4.0,Some of the silver is already flaking off.
4.0,I rather pay a little more to get a more realistic Pixiu charm. Making bracelets to sell I only use quality beads and charms these make my bracelets look cheap
4.0,Very cute. Everything for perfectly except for the halter top. The straps were waaaaaay too short. I ended up using it as a skirt which sucks because the skirt was cheaper and had a more float mermaid effect but I liked the dress more...
4.0,Comes apart. Lost a few.
4.0,"5'5&#34;, 140lbs, 34DDD, Ordered a medium. Item fit perfectly except in the bust. The criss cross pattern pulls tightly on my neck (because it doesn't fit around my breasts properly) and makes the shoulders of the dress sit too high and close to my neck. A large will be too big everywhere else. Style is just not compatible with my body. 4 stars because this dress is so comfy. Soft, warm lining and (mostly) stretchy fabric."
4.0,my friend wears these nearly everyday for work. He loves them.
4.0,"Great for $17.99!!! Comfortable, no sequence fell off at all. :) The design is only on front. Back is black. im 5'5, 165 and i bought the med/large which fits a size 8-12. Super happy with purchase. A little big in armpit but i have 34 DD so it didnt bother me. I safety pinned around my hips just to give some shape to dress. It was great for 20's party"
4.0,"This key cover looks amazing, i only gave it 4stars because the screw was missing from the keychain but amazon made it right."
4.0,Wonderful piece for the price.  LOVE IT.
4.0,"it is bigger than I thought.the slots are too tight.No big proplems.Overall,it is good one."
4.0,I don't have fat wrists but these were a little tighter than I would like. They would be comfortable on tiny hands. If you have large hands....forget it.<br />So they are quality made and warm but they are bit uncomfortable around the wrist.<br /><br />They also look very cool and fun!
4.0,"I like the style of the cufflink. It is the easy typical design where the one end folds straight then pops out horizontally to stay in place. It feels sturdy and has a nice look to it. I am happy, but not sure the typical price for these things."
4.0,"Be advised: This is cut large in the leg. I got the black, but I think it would be quite pretty in red. It took a long time to arrive. ...more than  a month before being delivered."
4.0,"Returned because it was too small. The description says to order 1 size smaller because of the unique stretch factor. I would recommend NOT ordering a size smaller. If I had ordered my regular size, they would have fit. As a result I had to pay a $10 restocking fee for the misleading advertising. The material of the jeans themselves feel great and I bet they would have been a nice pair."
4.0,Comfortable. Good lense quality
4.0,Completely as described Great shipper.  Would Use again.
4.0,"Nice, as advertised."
4.0,It was lightweight as to be expected. The color actually was perfect. However I wanted it to be a little longer. Other than that it was great.
4.0,Nice quality comfortable and washes nicely
4.0,"great shop slipper, decent rubber sole"
4.0,Runs smaller in chest
4.0,Ordered these for my niece! She absolutely loved them! They were way bigger than expected. More like adult sizes. She definitely doesn't seem to mind though!
4.0,Bought it for my husband for work and he likes it so far no problems.
4.0,Básico para una fiesta
4.0,"Really like it, a little snug, but wearable."
4.0,"Heavy duty and casual polo.<br /><br />This is a cotton polo on the heavier side of things. It conveys durability. It washes well and holds up well. Some of the stitching is on the lower end of mediocre, particularly the tuck-in points of the breast pocket. The style and color arrangement are acceptable but not flashy (my wife did not care for it). Price point is reasonable."
4.0,Material is thin.  You have to wear a tank under it .
4.0,"These earrings are very pretty and a good value for the price. I do wish they sparkled more though. However, using jewelry cleaner on them helped shine them up a bit. The earrings are small - about 6 inches in length- but I knew this when purchasing them. They are also on the thinner side. That being said, they still drop slightly from the earlobe and look very nice on the ears. These earrings are perfect for everyday wear and can be worn with virtually any outfit. I plan on wearing them often."
4.0,The only reason I've returned it was that the length was not what I wanted. I've reordered the dress in the next size and I like it better!
4.0,"The skirt is real pretty, the separate bottom panties are a little skimpy, but it's a real pretty suit so I'm going to keep it anyway."
4.0,I loved the style and material of this dress. It had a nice stretch but still felt study. However it seems to run pretty small. I’m a 12 on top and 14 bottom and the XL was too small specifically in the arms all the way to the elbow. I’ve never had an xL dress be too small. I wish they carried at XXL because I gladly would have exchanged the dress.
4.0,"I have large upper arms so it is a bit snug in the arms. Otherwise, I love it."
4.0,"I ordered three of these in various colors for my daughter.  She is all of 110 lbs., and these just fit, so be forewarned, if you're not small, these will likely be too snug.  For her they fit very well.  These are not always easy to find, so I'm very happy with the purchase."
4.0,"but,The color is much darker than the photo"
4.0,"It's a bit thinner than other brands. Preferably take the next size up. But love how light, packable, warm and how good it looks. Something you can just throw into your daybag and on the go. Don't expect too much but you'll get something for your money's worth."
4.0,These were five dollars on Prime Day and well worth It.
4.0,"Just arrived, Shipped quickly and packaging was done well. This bag comes packaged from American West in a nice drawstring bag to keep it in, albeit kind of a cheaply made bag. The purse itself is just as I expected. It's a nice leather bag. I think the straps could have been made with a little more quality leather but overall its a good looking purse. The inside is quality fabric, roomy and has enough side pockets for lipstick and little things.The cross body strap is why it didn't get 5 stars. American West provides a lifetime warranty for manufacturing defects, just go online and register your bag when it arrives. Easy to do. I like it for the Amazon price, wouldn't have bought it at the Sheplers price of over $200.<br />I'll use it and enjoy it. I would buy other American West bags or wallets.<br />-jewel hickman"
4.0,Comfortable and cute but the seem down the back can be annoying. It's not itchy but still kind of irritating at times. The opening at the neck is just the right hieght that it usually still shows a necklace if it slips inside my shirt.
4.0,"The black shirt doesn't have a white cat. It's a grey color. It's still cute, but it's inaccurate."
4.0,My son loved them. He is really skinny and they fit perfectly. Will definitely order more.
4.0,They are great.  The waist could be higher.
4.0,Super cute. Super sexy after I raised the slit. Got so many compliments but wish the print was visible on both sides.
4.0,Nice glasses but too wide for my female face.
4.0,Not very sturdy feeling but very cute. Look exactly like the photos.
4.0,"Nice earrings. They seemed a little smaller in person, but still nice"
4.0,I saw these shorts advertised on social media and had to get them. They are comfy but the material of the top layer bunches up in the front making it look like a... you know where I’m getting at. Maybe sizing up would fix the problem but I’m contemplating on returning for that reason.
4.0,I took this to New York as my purse. It turned out to be just the right size (not too big ) there's a ton of storage and I wasn't constantly digging around. It also turned out to be less cumbersome and lighter than it looks
4.0,Very comfortable.. a little longer than expected as I am 5’3”.
4.0,Beautiful dress!!! I should have ordered a bigger size
4.0,I love the look of this watch band but the snaps don’t jive with the size of my wrist.  Normal size wrist.
4.0,"The band appears well-made, although he clasp and length adjusting mechanisms needed a bit of thought and force the first few times."
4.0,Runs a bit large.
4.0,I really love the material. It’s so comfortable but very flattering as well
4.0,"Beautiful and well made.  Looks great on fair skin.  Measured 34in across fullest part of breast.  Wear 32C in a victoria Secret bra.  This measurement fits in charts Sm size.  But I might nip out so ordering a size up to make a choice before returning one.  Matching bottom is definitely a size too small compared to avail chart.  Order up one size.  It will not fall off.  Its quality and  I'm sure the sizes are precise and exactly the same for all smells, larges... reliable quality.  But I hate being squeezed or just barely covering.  So I'd prefer a M on both top and bottom.  Just hope they aren't so drastic.  I think my measurements were at the top spectrum of the Sm range."
4.0,Hands where small.
4.0,Cute shoes and reasonable price but the elastic is white and shows through the side of the bows.
4.0,I love the width others don’t even come close to sitting right under my sport bar. However I didn’t feel I sweated as much. I don’t know if it just completely absorbed.
4.0,"Good looking purse, genuine leather, right on the money. My wife likes it for everyday carry around. No complaints, so far. Four stars is a good review for this purse."
4.0,"I will be going to a wedding at the end of July so I bought this dress. It fits a bit loose, I’m wondering if the medium would have fit better- it’s not too bad but I will have to take in the shoulders straps a bit so that it’s not so long in the top. It’s a thin fabric - I thought it would be more structured which I wanted to hold my belly in - however it will be hot - Dominican wedding- so I’m not supper upset about that except I will have to wear some shapewear under which can get uncomfortable for the same reason."
4.0,"It’s wonderful! I really love it ! satisfied , great to wear in parties I m give 4star out of 5 , it has small stone and it’s coming off every time you wear and take it off . Other than it completely perfect ! Delisha fashion has very good customer service ."
4.0,"There's nothing wrong with the chain itself, but I just don't like the look of it.  I don't like how it's flat, but that's my issue--not the chain's or the seller's.  But the chain itself is good and easy to work with."
4.0,"These will fit up to 41"" waist with just stretching the belt a little. The adjustment clasp has a tall profile, and may dig in depending on where it lands on your body. Some stitches look like they may come out near the buckle. The colors are dark. The tan looks a bit green in some light & the blue is Super Bright."
4.0,"I bought a large - I'm 5'9', 170 pounds and they are just right.  I love the high waist that doesn't roll down and the pocket that holds my large cell phone. Not see-thru either.  Oh, and the stitching is nice."
4.0,Quality garment as we've come to expect from Lands End
4.0,I truly enjoyed these fleece socks.  They are so comfortable and keep my feet warm.
4.0,Just as I expected them to be.
4.0,"Loved these dresses, especially with a pair of leggings and boots, however after a few washes they have started to fade, looks dingy."
4.0,Good size for a 5t. Not as flexible as I would like for a child but they are okay and a pretty good quality and value for the price
4.0,"Good for the price. It's a close knock-off of Peak Design's strap, with different attachment clips that are adequate but not as rugged as the PD. This is a good budget upgrade from the standard strap that ships with cameras from the manufacturer, but for my expensive primary body (Canon R5) I prefer the Peak Design."
4.0,This necklace is really cute. It took about a month to arrive. The bottom charm on the necklace is a slightly lighter gold tone than the rest of the necklace. It's not that noticeable. I still love it. It's my new favorite.
4.0,I love the fabric and the weight of the fabric and the design. Problem.....they fit very well but skin tight on a 71 year old is not attractive.  I wish I had ordered a Large in a 30 inch length but they didn't have that size.<br />I will keep them and wear them at home because i love the pants.... just not for public.
4.0,Very nice fit and quality.
4.0,LOVE the top. Hate the bottoms. They're good for angled &#34;before and after&#34; workout shots but not very flattering for running around on the beach unless you're a size 00.
4.0,"I'm short, so the pants are kinda long, but that's okay. I love them!!"
4.0,Ran a little smaller than expected.
4.0,Husband wore this to a 20's theme party and he loved it. He did say that it was a little snug for his liking but otherwise it was ok. The material was good quality and the color was great.
4.0,"Looks good, very functional as well.  No complaints"
4.0,"this blouse was great and looked so nice, however it was much bigger than expected for a size small."
4.0,"Great product but not as thick as I thought it would be.  I would defiantly buy more & would recommend to fellow bike riders, outside workers, family & friends."
4.0,I like the fit an size an colors
4.0,Excellent quality.  Just what I was expecting.  Quick delivery as well.
4.0,"Only reason I gave it a 4 is because the gold detail rings on the bracelet came off some. Besides that it’s perfect, and there’s plenty of the rings so not very noticeable"
4.0,Just like the ad says...
4.0,"Fits fine.  Don't pull on the bottom or the built-in &#34;foam&#34; for the peplum part with split.  It looks really cute, though."
4.0,I loved the material and the quality of this handbag. The packaging was also on point
4.0,"Super nice pants, just too short.  Wa for a 6’1” 205 muscly man. Needed a 34-33 inseam. These more like 30”"
4.0,"I hoped that the large size gloves  would fit, they dont.  Need XL"
4.0,"These are very comfortable , but cut a little bigger than their barely  bootcut pants. I am 5'8, and weigh 127 pounds, hips are 38 inches and waist is 27 inches. I wear size 8 in these and size 10 in the barely bootcut . I wish that both styles would have a bootcut that is less full. It makes the style look dated. I cannot wear the straight leg  cut as I get claustraphobic , especially in the summer. I don't like my pants really tight, but I also don't want  excess drape. The size 8 works perfectly. I think these pants have a slimming effect. And they are inexpensive enough that I am happy to order multiple pairs, as you never know when the inventory will run out."
4.0,I am 6ft 185lbs<br />I ended up getting a 30 short
4.0,"These would get a full 5 stars if it wasn't for the seam...it goes straight down the middle, so they ride up to places you don't want them to go. Other than that, they're great. They're really soft, and they're not too thin. Just that evil seam!"
4.0,"Love it. Fits perfect. It is very short so if your not comfortable with possible showing some skin, this is not for you. The material is not as bad as some reviews make it seem. Its soft, tight fitting. So if you have a little muffin top you should go a size up. The color is pretty and exact as picture. Its worth it."
4.0,"When I received these jeans, they were slightly small, but livable.  However, when I washed them they shrank so much that they were then uncomfortable.  I returned them with no problem and will be ordering a larger size.  They are heavyweight, well made jeans.  Just plan on ordering a larger size than you normally would."
4.0,we liked them
4.0,"This suit is made of very good material. The breast pads are a bit too firm and boxy, so I removed them and it looks much better that way. I'm 5'7&#34;, weigh 150 and wear a 36B bra and a large fits nicely on me. If you have a long torso, order a size up like me and you shouldn't have any problems."
4.0,It is a well made very attractive bag!
4.0,"fit a 31&#34; to 32&#34; inseam fine, in flats.  GREAT casual work pants."
4.0,"Good travel wallet for the price. Definitely not high end, but I like the red. Good bargain."
4.0,Very cute. Perfect for young kids.
4.0,I took 4 yrs like i usually take for my daughter...but it was not the write size
4.0,"Beautiful and sexy! I only thought it was black, but it came like kind of navy blue"
4.0,Wasn't the same chain like online
4.0,Fine glove just a little thick.  Feel they will be great after they are broken to my hands
4.0,The print is nice but the quality is not nice. I have only worn it 2 times. I wash the dress in gentle cycle then hang dry and the threads already coming out.
4.0,Really cute. Material and fit is a little stiff but not complaining for the price!
4.0,I bought it as a gift and i love it! The quality is good and shipped really fast! Was here in less than a week!
4.0,"Ladies apparel, so the bust fitting is to be desired. Buttons one can negotiate, but for an item of clothing one must remove completely to use the restroom... not ideal.<br /><br />Also... Wrinkle City, party of 1. Maybe some fabric softener, but with 70% cotton I did not want to chance it with the shrinking factor.<br /><br />Cute though. Give it a go."
4.0,Very sharp looking watch.
4.0,"I bought other shirts, but this is the only one that fits a little snug"
4.0,"This is a thick watch band with a large buckle.  It is really a beautiful watch band and looks great with my SEIKO SUB017 that has a Green dial and gold numbers. The Thread is close to gold in color, so it matches quite well.  I gave it 4 stars because most of the band was shaded black, very little green showing and only under your wrist."
4.0,"This is definitely a cute, soft cardigan and love it for fall! I thought it was going to be a rust orange color, but it’s definitely a normal orange. I took a picture with a rust orange shirt to compare. I’m definitely still happy with it overall!!"
4.0,"Prompted delivery, as described."
4.0,Yes I'm giving it as a Christmas present
4.0,Good jacket for raining 🌧 season
4.0,Very pretty only complaint is the pendant is a little on the larger side
4.0,Purchased for costume. Liked it. Good quality.
4.0,"Hello,I just received my order and would like to Thank you!"
4.0,I'm mostly size 4 or size 2 in Calvin Klein dresses.<br />(34C-27-33)<br /> I ordered rose (hotpink) small. And it's  kindda loss but it works. Beautiful soft material. Love it
4.0,Feels nice but tends to be bulky.
4.0,"A cute bag, but...<br />It is a soft duffle, so there is no structure to hold a nice shape.  Even the bottom sags, as there is nothing to keep it flat.<br />The zipper top is disappointing.  There is a good gap on each end of the top.  Anyone could reach their hand in the bag OR small items could easily tumble out.<br />I'm keeping it, because it is very cool and stylish."
4.0,had to cut it so it would look as represented in picture.
4.0,"I pulled them out of the bag & thought no way would these fit.  Surprise, surprise they fit, could be a bit longer, but not bad  Soft material, comfy to wear."
4.0,"The quality is good, the selection of basic colors in a multi pack is a nice option.  Not as short on my daughter as the picture shows, which is better for me."
4.0,"As you can see from the photo, the watch looks great. It's a neat little piece of budget steampunk fashion to complete that look you might be going for- granted it's more ""event oriented"" and not as an everyday watch. While the watch is of good quality, some of it's design features (such as the ""angled"" glass in the watch itself) seem like they'd quickly become worn or damaged. The band is a passable metal thing that took quite a bit of tweaking to get it resized, but it was doable. My biggest complaint about it would be the noise- it is a surprisingly noisy thing, and can be heard ticking away if the room is quiet enough. I can't speak for it's timekeeping abilities, though I doubt that the mechanism inside is anything to get excited about. However, for cosplay/costumes/convetions/etc. this thing really does look great and can fit a wide range of themes. If you're just more into ""weird watches"" granted you're aware this one isn't quite durable enough for everyday use, it'll make a fine addition to any collection too. If you're looking for something that's good for everyday use though, this probably isn't going to be it."
4.0,Liked...tea party
4.0,"They aren't worth retail, but they land on Slickdeals often for $13, buy them then."
4.0,Runs just a little small.  Advise ordering next size up from what you think you need.
4.0,As described; easy to use.  Seems somewhat &#34;light-weight&#34; but no issues yet with light usage.
4.0,"i bought this as a gift for my mother in law, i was very pleased at how quickly it arrived.  i was afraid that the jewelry would be very large and clunky as some native jewelry can be... however i thought it was a great size and well worth the money i would buy this item again."
4.0,"I purchased this for dressy occasions and I did receive it on time, but I didn't have time to check it out.  Overall the purse is nice, but it is dirty and I'll have to clean it up before I can use it."
4.0,"I bought this jacket in white and really like it. I have washed the pink one and the wrinkles won’t come out. I have it in the washer again with fabric softener. If the wrinkles don’t come out, I will be returning it. It is nice material and fits well."
4.0,Glasses are solid construction and look good. They aren't exactly as pictured here though so I gave 4 stars. It wasn't enough of a difference to worry about returning it exchanging. They're cute and do the job.
4.0,"I love this little purse. It is really cute, the beading was great and done well.  I could comfortably fit my cell phone, lipstick, and some other essentials. I rated it lower because the clasp kept opening :(  I will keep and try to fix because it is worth it."
4.0,Was as advertised. Nice material. Better than i thought it would be.
4.0,"These shirts run great, I ordered an XS, I'm usually M, but the XS, I fit, loose. The fabric is fine."
4.0,Cute jumper but definitely size up one size.  Bought for my toddler who wears a 4normally had to go to a 5-6
4.0,I love it. It just needs more colors
4.0,"Perfect fit, hides my tummy. Super comfy.  Slinky soft material.  Exactly what I was looking for.  My only complaint is the blue isn't the same shade that it appears online.  Not as bright.  But blue is my fave color,  so I'm happy with it."
4.0,"It would be a wonderful thing if Amazon would react to reviews by implementing additional notes when customers write in their review that the fingers are too long.  In my case, a half inch too long, yet tight everywhere else. I didn't even try the other hand, it's still in the vacuum sealed packaging.<br /><br />What a beautiful pair of elegant gloves!!"
4.0,Fit nicely but the material wrinkle was too bad. Also they should think about something that will make the shoulder fit better. Other than these it looks good. I think they should find a way to package it nicely as well.
4.0,I love this furry hat. I wear it as much as possible even. It’s super cute and fits great.  Only downside is the fur does come off some but not enough to be to bad
4.0,"One was stuck and had to use tools to get it apart, but overall very beautiful and well worth it"
4.0,"The color was more purple, but otherwise a great buy."
4.0,"I was hoping to use these under skirts to combat chafing. Unfortunately the legs are not quite long enough to accomplish this. Still comfortable, and definitely workable for someone who doesn't have to move around as much."
4.0,"These for sure helped out! I had an outdoor wedding and we walked around in the grass taking a lot of photos. Would have been much harder without them!  The box comes with two sizes in it, small and medium. After one days wear the wear pretty beat up and starting to fall apart but I would still recommend them!"
4.0,I ordered the pink and it is a nice shade.  Beware it runs BIG!!
4.0,"l only gave it four stars because it's not for me and I haven't worn it. The leather is beautiful and the batman symbol is a solid plate. The plate doesn't budge an inch so that's good. It's a little heavier than a normal snapback but hey it's made of leather!(except the rim). The size is the same as any snapback, one size will fit all. Unless you have a really small head. all in all a good product. Thumbs up."
4.0,"I love them. They are so cute. A bit on the heavy side, but am satisfied with the quality."
4.0,The size was completely off so I had to give them to someone else so I am writing what they said about the shoes. They absolutely love them and wear them on a regular basis not just when around water. They also said they are extremely comfortable. I just wish I had some that fit
4.0,"My little girl looked absolutely darling in this dress! But it was too big for her--which is why I only chose four stars. The dress is well-made, a gorgeous shade of yellow, and looks just like the picture. If I were buying this again, I'd choose (at least) one size down from what she normally wears."
4.0,"Very cute, appropriate for an adolescent girl who loves the band. Quality is worth the price. Nothing extravagant, but perfect for casual wear"
4.0,"I like the space that allows for a ponytail.  The material is nice and sturdy, however, the chin strap (while it’s okay) it is quite thin to feel secure in the west texas winds/gusts. These gusts also flipped the brim up and it proved pointless to try and flip it back down. One other thing, the watermelon red is more pink than I wanted, but I can see how it was “my bad”.<br />All-in-all, I’m very glad the hat is around for less windy days!"
4.0,"I bought this because I look horrible in yellow, but I love it anyway. I've always wanted a yellow swimsuit, but didn't want to drop money on something I know I'll rarely wear. At under $5, I figured I would try it out. It's actually pretty nice, not the highest quality construction, but no stray threads or popped stitches either. It fits well, and is fairly flattering, color aside. The color is also great. It's the exact yellow pictured, and I love it for that. If, unlike me, you look good in yellow, this could be a great option for hot tubs and beach time. At this price you won't care if it gets messed up, and you'll still look cute.<br /><br />That said, I still plan on wearing this all summer, on rotation with my other suits."
4.0,This is definitely the most stylish down parka I have ever tried on - probably because of the belt.  I read somewhere that it is good for low activity in 35 degree weather - and I would have to say I agree with that.  I went outside in about 38 degree weather with a light short sleeve t-shirt underneath and it worked - but<br />I suspect if I were just leisurely walking in a lower temperature I would want to have an extra layer underneath.  Again though - I thought for a down parka it was very stylish and the belt kept it from being just a straight coat.  It also zippers up to the neck and that looked nice.  The hood looked good also.  If you are using it just in and out of the car I would say you will be good - but if you are spending time outside under 35 degrees and not planning to move around much I would recommend a layer or two.
4.0,"Love the design. Love the soft feel. But if you look at the picture , the SLEEVES ARE REALLY REALLY LONG. and yes, they are!  They don’t stay pushed up, & don’t look good if you fold the sleeves. I’m going to have to pay $12 to have the sleeves Shortened, & the cuffs tightened up. So price wise , with shipping and alterations, I  ended up paying $35 for this shirt. They Run very very Large, too. I had to send my XXL back for a Extra Large & it’s still BIG & BAGGY.  But they didnt have a LARGE. Oh well. I still like it. Fast delivery , too."
4.0,I like the shoes very nice.  The only thing you can't wear them all day.
4.0,"It was just a little bigger than I was expecting, and the dry clean only tag shocked me, but it was for a Halloween costume so overall it worked well"
4.0,Good but way to small in my option
4.0,"This bathing suit is very cute I love the pattern and the material is nice. The top is padded. I'm pretty small 5,3 106 pounds but i'm not rail thin, just fit. The bra band around is just a little loose on me and feels a bit weird, but once washing it and trying it again, I got used to it :) Great buy. Love this bathing suit."
4.0,Great for my son's costume.
4.0,They were perfect for our event and made a splash at the Color Run!
4.0,"Great shirt for lounging with leggings, material a tad cheap, but overall, great for the price"
4.0,"Very cute dress overall, but it ran a little large. I'm about 5'2, 120lbs and the long shoulder length made the dress sit too loose at the top."
4.0,This is a very utilitarian piece of jewelry that it perfect for any type of pendent.  It hangs slightly below the collarbone on most me and mid-chest on most woman.  For me this is the perfect length
4.0,"cute, a tad bit short but acceptable with flats on."
4.0,"Muy grande los dijes, se ven muy corrientes, pero llegaron a tiempo"
4.0,"The style of the dress is cute as well as the length. I ordered an XL. I’m 195 pounds. The dress is a little stretchy which is good. But the top of the dress stretched to the point where the lines at the top changed color. It wasn’t too bad, it just looked like my boobs were squished. I’m sure if I would have ordered at 2X just for the sake of the top area, I would have been fine. I’m still going to order another style. Possibly changed up my undergarments. I’m a 38DD."
4.0,I like it just somewhat smaller than I expected. Would've given it 5 stars if it were bigger in size.
4.0,"I like this tie, seems to be high quality. I have some difficulty getting the knot right because it’s very different than my usual ties, but once tied it looks sharp!"
4.0,I have learned to order much lager then stores carry. Glad I did....super pretty on.
4.0,"I got these for my husband to use when he works out and he loves them. The only complaint was when he tried to put them on for the first time it was nearly impossible and it took the both of us to pull them off. Since the first wear, he hasn't had any troubles at all."
4.0,I like this top very much it has a zipper and a hood. I plan on using this( I’m calling it a jacket style top) for when the weather starts to get a little chilly and finally I have a HOOD I can’t wait to wear this!
4.0,I’m 5’6” 210 lbs. Got the XXL and it was a roomy fit. Overall I like it but be warn if you have sensitive skin as the grey part of the dress can be scratchy for some people. The dress sit about 3 inches above my knees. Overall I like it
4.0,The buckle was broken as soon as I opened.  Fits as expected.
4.0,The heel was a bit higher than I'd like
4.0,"A little more snug than I expected, but work well and look good. Much better than old ones who were maybe functional but looked like crap. Wore them with a skirt and friends thought I was wearing some stylish leggings."
4.0,"Looks and fits great! I ordered the thickest size, though, so it’s much bigger than I thought it would be. I was worried it wouldn’t be very noticeable on my finger, but it definitely is."
4.0,"They are super comfortable,  but not as compressive as I was hoping."
4.0,"Definitely not a dress for those of us 5'8&quot; and taller. I wish it was just a bit longer. However,  it's a wonderful loose top. I see myself wearing it at the beach over my bathing suit. Great for everyday running around. Lightweight material. I would recommend being mindful when washing it so you don't out stretch it."
4.0,"As the name and advertising suggested, the shirt is comfortable, looks respectable, and seems to be quite good quality."
4.0,"Great over the knee socks but a bit too tight for me. I am not a large person and they were tight all the way around, but very cute nonetheless. Had to return them. If you are small/petite they will be perfect. Very well made!!"
4.0,I loved this but like others said it is not a one size fits all.  It would probably work if you are taller and thinner.  I'm about a 4 to 6 and 5'2&#34;.  I could have kept it and was tempted bc it's really nice quality but ultimately decided that it doesn't have any stretch and feels a bit too confining across my chest.  I am not that large across the bust either.
4.0,"This is a cute little cap and I like how easy it is to throw on if I need to run out on a quick errand, check the mailbox, take my dog on a walk, etc. At first, I thought it might not fit since I have a bigger than average head (LOL) and poofy hair! Luckily, the strap is adjustable and pretty easy to adjust so that you get a tighter or looser fit.<br /><br />Once I lengthened the strap as much as I could, it did fit but fit snuggly. It's hard to get the cap all the way down on my forehead but it fits and looks fine, nonetheless. The back strap snaps in place and doesn't come loose. The cap itself is soft while the bill is pretty hard. I like the look of the hat on me and so does my husband. I only wish it could be a little looser so that I can pull it all the way down.<br /><br />I am honored to have received this product complimentary in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. All opinions are 100% mine."
4.0,"It's a pretty multi-color 5 with neutrals of taupe, creme and almond. There are also vibrate colors of violet and orange flowers with a reminiscence of an Asian garden. This truly is a beautiful sheer scarf and long enough to wrap around you neck a few times and be used as a smaller shawl across your shoulders. The measurements are 63 inches long by 19.7 inches width. It feels nice to the touch and it's made of polyester with the tag saying &#34;100% Silk Feeling Polyester&#34;.  If you're in the market for something feminine with neutrals with vibrate colors of Asian inspired motif, you won't be disappointed to these scarves.<br /><br />* I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review. I rely on honest reviews to help me decide my purchases. I hope this review was helpful for you."
4.0,"This is an effortless, comfortable chic outfit. The fabric is stretchy with a little luster. The tunic is long enough to hide any imperfections while looking sexy. It comes with a self-belt, but I think it would look better with a metal chain slung over the hips. It also looks good without a belt. The sleeves are ¾ with elastic. The pants are long and devoid of any weirdness around the crotch or waist."
4.0,"Beautiful hat, sturdy design.... Wish it was a little deeper, but all in all a quality hat... And nothing more beautiful than the Raider Shield..."
4.0,"Super cute! Clean feet, without so much Heat."
4.0,Came so fast Amazon has yet to mark it as delivered. Suppose to come mid July. Down fall is that I wish the fuzz ball was bigger. It's the size of a tennis ball but everything else is all good
4.0,It is a very cute top but please be aware that it does run a bit big so you may want to size down it
4.0,great seller. item as described
4.0,"Cute style.  Flattering shape. Hard to keep on hanger.  Needs ironing, which I don’t like."
4.0,"This was nice product, especially for the price.  It was much larger than expected, but it was easily adjustable by adding another hole."
4.0,Good value.  Runs a bit small / short.
4.0,"My daughter wanted to be a wolf 🐺 pack for Halloween/Samhain. She wanted to be a purple one ( which we got from somewhere else) & for me to be the red one. These were my favorite ones that I had found with that shade of red 😍<br /><br />Pros: Beautiful deep red color! The tail especially is very soft! The head band for the ears was actually comfortable. ( I get migraines sometimes when things are on my head, headbands seem to be the worst culprits for me..) No headache or anything after wearing them for a good 8hrs. The tail doesn’t bend or have wires, so this would be a great option for kiddos so they don’t scratch their back on some of those plastic pieces that mount the bendable tails.<br /><br />Con: The only draw back, in my opinion, would be not as much of the red fur on the ears. They look great but I expected a bit more of the red fur, it was mostly white fur with a bit of red. I may purchase some red fur to add to them myself for a different occasion.<br /><br />Overall, wonderful set for some furry fun!<br />I would recommend them!"
4.0,"Theses great shoes almost a little too soft, but have great support and very comfortable. I’m very pleased with this purchase."
4.0,Love them for church.  Comfortable too.
4.0,"Feel great, easy to get on.  Not as tight as I wanted; I ordered the smalls but should be okay.  I use them when I run.  Over all happy so far.  Great price compared to others I have looked at."
4.0,Good quality product. Solid. Very happy with it.
4.0,"Fitted very well, comfortable and warm !"
4.0,"These are great novrlty earrings, just a little too big and heavy for me."
4.0,"The shoe fit nicely! I have a wider foot that doesn’t fit most heals/flats/sandals and I don’t feel like my foot is being squished at all! I would say if you have a reallly wide foot, these are not for you, but if you just a somewhat wide foot, these are an option!"
4.0,"I belong to a seniors group called LIFE, Learning Institute For Life, and our logo is the Tree of Life. I saw these and ordered them immediately. They are quite pretty, but I didn't think to look at the measurements and was a bit disappointed that they weren't<br /> larger. That being said, for the price, these earrings were an incredible buy!"
4.0,"My husband gave these to me, and they are some of my favorite earrings! They are dramatic, with the styling and length. I think that most people would probably wear these for special occasions since they are so dramatic. However, I am a professional psychic medium, and I love clothing that is flowing, romantic, and dramatic, so I wear these regularly.<br /><br />I find that I am particular about what I wear them with because the stones are so colorful, and I'm picky about coordinating my colors. Thus, I tend to plan my whole outfit around these earrings (typically all black with a black and gold celestial-themed scarf).<br /><br />The one thing that I don't love is that they easily get twisted around at the joints whenever they brush up against my scarf, my coat, my hair, etc. Whenever I wear them, I am constantly having to make sure all the segments are facing the right direction.<br /><br />The earrings are a heavy weight, as in they are a solid quality, but the weight of them have never bothered my ears.<br /><br />They are great!"
4.0,"Fit somewhat large and the red is more of an orangey-red instead of the deep red I was going for. Didn't flatter my shape, so I sent it back."
4.0,Fabric is light but if stretched can be a little see through. Perfect with leggings.
4.0,Hand wash recommendation
4.0,Really nice casual dress. Could be worn over leggings also. Material is a bit more stretchy than I thought it might be.
4.0,great fashion style
4.0,These are very sturdy and useful and very nice looking
4.0,Fits as expected but the armholes are a smidgen large so it's looser at the bust than I'd like. Length is great - I can never find dresses long enough. Not sure I can wear high heels with them but low wedges and sandals work (I'm 5'8&#34;).
4.0,"Earrings were smaller than I expected, but still nice."
4.0,"I am usually an xl, but i am swimming in this. Go down a size. Other than that its cute and comfty and not sheer."
4.0,Great for breast feeding
4.0,"You like pockets and quality feel? This has you covered! Though it takes a while to wear in the pockets and slots for cards. Wish it came pre-worn? Just a little? Otherwise, it is a loooooot thicker than I had imagined, but the quality is true&#60;3"
4.0,"The dress hugs my curves “deliciously” says my hubby. The colors of the roses and leaves are beautiful. I can wear pink, green, yellow, white and red shoes with it. I’m 5ft 3 inches tall and it’s rather long with 4 inch heels, but I can hem it. My measurements are 34DD-28-38 and I ordered the XL. The fit is wonderful.  The only con I have is that the dress is VERY see through. I tried it on with a slip and my panties are still visible. This is the reason for 4 starts instead of five. I am on the fence if I’m going to return it because it is such a gorgeous dress. I received this item at a reduced price for my honest and unbiased review."
4.0,I love this wallet but only gave it 4 stars because of the color.  I picked red because I hate black wallets and those colors were the only choices for this style with the RFID protection.  I chose the wallet anyway because I loved the style.  I'm happy with this wallet but wish the manufacturer would offer more colors in this style because I would buy them all.
4.0,I ordered this dress in a Large b/c I had a feeling the medium would be super tight.  The Large is very form-fitting in the mid-section and butt/hip area.  I'm usually size Medium or an 8.  Its a cute dress...will be wearing it with my spanx!
4.0,Nice dress.  Not my favorite miusol dress but good for work.
4.0,[[VIDEOID:ad64d5580ec405661dd75e049e600586]] So cute! Can literally fit as a choker and extend too!! Not as shiny as I would like it. But still super cute. Love!!
4.0,"This swimsuit fits as stated. Constructed well. The neck strap is thick and short. I would not recommend this if you have a very long torso. I am 5'2 and it works for me. The fringe is the best part as it covers most of the stomach area. The product came quick and the seller polite. I would recommend this seller and purchase from them again. I also would recommend this suit to someone who has a shorter torso for a proper fit.<br /><br />This product was purchased at a discount.

4.0,"A bit on the thin side. Should have ordered a darker color, but very comfortable."
4.0,This purse has lots of pockets. It's not too big or too small
4.0,Shirt was slightly too big for me. I am in that awkward Large and XL range so it makes buying shirts tough. Overall I like the shirt though
4.0,"Adorable and supportive. I usually wear a size 4, but based on reviews and sizing chart I ordered a L. The cups are a big large on me (34B) but not terribly so, and the torso is short (I'm 5'4). I couldn't tell from the photos but it is like a faux tankini in front with a smooth back. Still have to adjust a bit because of the wires and the shortness of the torso, but it's rare to find a one-piece w/ underwire for an affordable price, so I'm keeping it."
4.0,This one ok
4.0,Great quality and presentation! Set came with a velvet draw sting bag.  Great idea for stocking stuffers or gift ideas.
4.0,I enjoy wearing this necklace as the colors blend with many of my outfits.  The lenght is good. The only issue I have is when I lay it down it becomes tangled easily but I have now started being sure to hang it and not problems.
4.0,"The color of this dress in navy blue is gorgeous and it is nice and light for summer!  Unfortunately, they run big and a size small states that it is equivalent to a size 6.  I am a size 2 with a very small chest, so this didn't fit me.  I think if I had a fuller chest, the dress would have still worked great for a loose flowing, summertime dress.  Luckily, it fit my mom perfectly!  The length was great (she is about 5'9&#34;) and the color was perfect for her 4th of July celebration!  The material is 95% polyester and 5% spandex and it is available in 4 colors."
4.0,"These are extremely adorable and look exactly like in the picture. My only qualm about the earrings is that they are heavy on the ear. Otherwise, they were a perfect gift."
4.0,"Loved the color. However, I could not find a bra to wear underneath that did not show through.  I returned it on July 25 and am still awaiting my refund."
4.0,"Very nice , it was much smaller than what I thought it would be , but overall nice. Great quality"
4.0,Nice as I ordered
4.0,Great add on to my purses during the Covid Virus.
4.0,Nice heavy weight looks fine for custom . Chain is very short for a male had to use a different length chain.
4.0,"I ordered a large, but it fit like a small/medium. I ordered the 2XL and it barely fits correctly. I haven’t washed them yet and am hoping they do not shrink."
4.0,Not sure where the negative reviews are coming from but this fits my moto 360 great. My only complaint is it can be difficult to remove links however mine fit perfectly out of the box so it wasn't an issue.
4.0,"So far I’m happy with my purchase. I usually wear a 2x and the 18 fits great. I like the sewn-in panty and the length is just what I wanted. I also like the waistband and that it’s smooth like a suit, and not “gathered“ with elastic."
4.0,love this just alittle big
4.0,Very nice  I like them
4.0,"Well made, good zippers, lightweight."
4.0,took awhile to get here but I wear them a lot and they are very comfortable..fit any style of daily dress
4.0,Sleeves are a little long. Very thin but comfortable. I love them.
4.0,"We run our house Hawaii style, no shoes in the house.  These socks work great!  !  !"
4.0,"I bought this ear cuff, and it arrived ahead of schedule. At first I thought it sat awkwardly on my ear, but after wearing it for a bit, I really started to love it. I get complements on it ALL the time!! I thought parts of it felt like plastic, but it looked good and didn't irritate my ears at all!"
4.0,The sleeves were extremely long in relation to the jersey. Taking it to a seamstress to have them fixed. The body of the jersey fit perfectly. Nice jersey and for the price it is worth getting the sleeves fixed.
4.0,I had my across the body for  a couple of months now and it's in great condition. It was affordable the perfect size my only problem is it wasn't the right color red.<br />It looked red on the screen and burgundy in reality.
4.0,"I have bought 2 different colors and both are much darker than listed photos.  I really like them, but the quality is not great.  It becomes fuzzy after you wash it."
4.0,The belt loops are strange so the sash does not sit correctly
4.0,This messenger bag was the perfect size that I had been looking for. I purchased it in the green color which matches most of the clothing colors that I wear.
4.0,Lots of pieces to use to make easy necklaces for the holidays...
4.0,"Good, no dislikes"
4.0,"Very nice Wallet, very thin and just perfect size, quality is not very great, meaning that it will wear out after several months and you will have to buy another one, lucky us, it very cheap."
4.0,"Lots of compliments! I'm pretty curvy so it's a little snug in the butt, but they're still cute and I love to wear them."
4.0,If you have a big belly (I'm carrying twins) this probably will not be as long as you want. I'm 8 months pregnant and this just barley gets over my belly. I'm slightly over weight so if you are a smaller girl this may actually be OK for you. I look forward to using it alot after delivery.
4.0,"It’s a skull, it has to be cool! 😝"
4.0,"Very nice and good quality, it just doesnt come with a chain so you have to fins something to hang it from.  But all and all good quality and very unique!"
4.0,I wish these were even a bit larger so they would be truly oversized.
4.0,"It's very pretty, but thin. I wore nude spanks to avoid showing too much at church. Also shirt hem..not the best for tall women, but it came together"
4.0,I like the construction of the jacket over all. The only suggestion I would give to Herschel is that I want the hood to be shorter. They could easily put a tab in the top of the hood to make it smaller. When I have the hood 'down' it covers my eyes.  Otherwise I love the quality and like that it was an official licensed Keith Haring collaboration.
4.0,"It had right amount of ruffles (not too much) and my 1 year old was comfortable in it.<br />Be careful while washing, it will leak color."
4.0,"the Mediom was large, and the pants were really long.  I returned it.  Overall it would have been fine - other than the length of the pants (probably 10 inches too long)  I'm 5' 4"""
4.0,Arms are too snug for me nice coat over all.
4.0,"Came fast, quality was so-so."
4.0,Kind of tight but they served their purpose.
4.0,Runs a little small.  Looks great.
4.0,"Love this, only thing is it broke kinda quickly."
4.0,The Price is Right on the money I used it on my boots 2 times still little bit over half full still
4.0,It fit smaller than expected but can work for now. Size 8 shorts in other brands fit more loosely
4.0,Great material but a little snug in the back part. the back straps create rolls unfortunately.
4.0,"I got these for my wife for Christmas. She loved the color but they run small. They still fit her but are tight. They do stretch a little, but I would go up one size if you order them."
4.0,"Loved it, you get what you pay for."
4.0,"Robeez are great shoes for the little foot - easy to put on, stays on and are comfortable.  My daughter has worn them since she was a baby and loves them especially their cute designs.  We loved these little sporty ones, but the toe came unsewn.  Robeez very easily replaced them, but this style was no longer available which was VERY disappointing.  Overall very happy with the shoe just wished this style was still available."
4.0,"Great dress, love it just wish it wasn't too large, gave it away. Followed the sizing chart."
4.0,"This is super flattering. It’s so cute. I just had a baby and this is the only dress that makes me feel sexy. Only negative is that is that the back is a bit wide so if you have some rolls, they’ll show."
4.0,My daughter saw these shoes on line and fell in love with them. She is on the short side and the thick soles make her taller.  She loves them . They came fairly quick and the shoes were as described. Will order from these people again.
4.0,"Fit as expected. Cute pants, as pictured."
4.0,"I like this one too, but due to a back injury, don't have any support for my breats."
4.0,"Extremely flattering with a simple, elegant design.  The only problem I have is getting the wrinkles out. I’ve tried everything and still can’t get them all."
4.0,"Just what I expected. The frames fit my face nicely, the lenses seem a little looser than other sunnies I've had, but the price was right for polarized."
4.0,Love everything about these socks! Very good quality!!
4.0,"Ordered a similar dress in a small that worked well so I ordered the same size and it was too small. Returned because I should have gotten a size up, but didn't reorder because I thought it would be too long for my height. Comfy and fun dress though"
4.0,This robe is just okay.  Decent quality and nice color.  Would never use it for anything other than as a robe.
4.0,This is a really cute shirt. I really like how it fits on me
4.0,"A great and good looking replacement band for the rubber or silicone band on the inexpensive U8 Bluetooth watches that everyone seems to be selling.  However, it does not come with new pins or any instructions on how to best open and close the clip for sizing it.  For these reasons I can only give it 4 stars."
4.0,"These are the most interesting outfits. First of all they are both confusing at first glance. How did I put them on? It took a little thought but I figured it out. Now here's where it is interesting. These outfits are SO comfortable. It's basically all string and see through. But its also so soft and doesn't even feel like you are wearing anything. The black outfit fit perfectly, including the string panties. The red outfit was a tad bit big. The black outfit felt like a second skin. I felt kind of bare in the red outfit. And that's saying a lot considering what these outfits really look like. Honestly, I love them. I may never own anything like these again but at least I can say I had a great time with them."
4.0,Love the lightweight material of these pants. They were comfortable but more snug on the upper legs than I personally like.
4.0,It is a bit smaller than I expected. But well made and pretty.
4.0,really pretty - i'd buy from this seller again
4.0,it fit great and it had a nice color to it
4.0,"Fits great, but it's so freaking cold!"
4.0,"I was a little nervous because I saw the reviews. I usually wear between 12-15 lol. It varies alot and I am actually pregnant with my 3rd child now and the large fit perfect fine. These have a nice stretch to them. Only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because I felt for the larger sizes it shouldve been a little bit longer because it ends weirdly at the bottom. But nonetheless, got the job done and I am happy with my purchase."
4.0,It's like expected.
4.0,"Good lighter weight garment to wear in the colder months.  Heavy enough to ward off a bit of the chill of a VT winter, but thin enough not to be uncomfortable under pants.  Only wish the front pouch was a roomy as it looked in the picture.  On the whole, a good undergarment to add a little warmth for the winter"
4.0,Finally got a chance to use it during a rain last weekend.  It is a little bigger than most larges but as far as rainsuits go I thought it fit like most.  It goes over your clothes so needs to be a little big.  This suit is good bang for the buck.  I definitely did not get wet and although it doesn't breathe as well as a $300 FJ suit it was 80 degrees and I was absolutely fine.  I would recommend.
4.0,These do the job. I just was a bit disappointed with the price after I want to the Dollar store and say I could do about the same for $4. Mind you you can't but 3X reader sunglasses for a buck. Maybe that is where the extra $$ comes from. They do work
4.0,"Sleeves are tight, shirt is too long"
4.0,"Based on other reviews, I ordered a size up and I definitely should not have! It is huge on me!! Order your regular size or a size smaller even. However, the item itself is very cute!!"
4.0,Very nice and unassuming.
4.0,"I purchased these in the same size I ordered another set of tanks from this brand. The sizes are definitely not the same. Previously I was a medium, with this set I am a xl (I am 5’7”, 155 pounds, 40B bra size). After I got the size right I went ahead and washed and line dried them. First wear out the gate I noticed the lack of moisture wick. I thought maybe it was just a fluke and maybe I was just running warm that day. Nope, it’s been like that every time. I feel like these will be a good first layer, under sweatshirt type tank for the cold months. I’m pretty if I attempted to wear these in the summer I’d end up with under boob crescent moon shaped sweat marks before I even left the house. I haven’t attempted to actually wear these while running because I’m concerned that these will end up with the sweat smell stuck in them. On a more positive note the colors are great! The purple and green are a perfect addition to a fall/ winter wardrobe."
4.0,The glasses look amazing and I got my prescription put in it but the design of the black ones peel off the more you wear it
4.0,"Nice fit, lots of compliments."
4.0,Cute color but runs a little big
4.0,"Attractive boot, but I had to return because the heel was very big."
4.0,The only thing I didn't like is the eyes to the wholes came off when I tightened the strings.
4.0,Didn't fit as good as I had wanted it to but I still love it! Came before ETA
4.0,great at night but takes getting used to
4.0,This dress is sooo cute but I had to return it because the large was too big in the chest area.  Good material and not see through.  I will be ordering a medium soon.
4.0,"Great dress! Wonderful, vibrant color. Super soft and lightweight. Perfect length (at top of knees and I am 5’4”). LOVE the pockets! My only complaint is that the material is thin and the yellow is see thru. I have to wear a cami and a slip under."
4.0,"This my second wallet. The first one I bought at a store. I will be honest it does last for about 3 years before the edges start fraying. However, I loved this wallet so much that I was ok with getting another. It is a great looking wallet, people are always commenting on it and it does what a wallet is supposed to do without being super thick."
4.0,Good for the price. Fit as expected. Not sure about long term is of the coat due to it being so thin. It is super thin!
4.0,I bought L and the top fit great but the pants fit more like a Large+ (if that's a thing). Overall it's good.
4.0,Got today. Hoping I don’t have any allergic reactions. Will have to update later if I do or don’t. Easy to put in and feels comfortable so far!
4.0,"simple, but good"
4.0,"I got this today and I really liked it. It is as pictured and with the previous review I have to agree, my husband also said it looked like a hospital gown but cute, it was just the color.  Fabric is a nice feel and as far as size goes I'm a 16/18 and it still fit but I think due to my size it was starting to look more like a shirt and not as loose as it is on the model but... I'm also not a size 0 so that was to be expected but I just wanted to give a heads up to the curvy girls out there that you may need something else, I think I saw another listing for this in a plus size on Amazon. Overall as expected and I'm pleased. One other point the front is shorter than the back and I didn't realize that from the picture.  The back covers your butt well so if you are worried about that you are fine."
4.0,Worked perfectly for a Willy Wonka themed costume for kids.
4.0,Fits super cute and wasn’t extremely wide. I purchased this product to help hide my stomach. It was wide enough to hide it and not make you feel pregnant.fabric was very light and great for the summer.<br />The reason why I only gave it 4 stars was because I purchased a “white” but product was more like a beige. I wore a white tank top under because it was see thru. Would purchase in another color.
4.0,Just as pictured. Good cut and fabric.
4.0,"It is really cute and dresses well, but the medium size is a bit to big for my daughter. I believe it fits somehow larger for a medium size. But I will keep it."
4.0,"This was a gift and very well received - nice craftsmanship, stones well matched - definitely a good purchase"
4.0,Watch band was good
4.0,Used on an airplane trip and they seemed to work well. The foot length and calf circumference were great. They were just a little too long  - came up to just above my knee so I had turn the top down a little.  Otherwise would have given then 5 stars .
4.0,Nice dress just wish it wasn't so expensive
4.0,Love the variety and price
4.0,"Beautiful but it is a lot of necklace, so it is a little warm."
4.0,"Fell in love with the pattern of this dress and had to have it. The fabric is really slinky and thin, but other than that it is perfect. The fit is very flattering and it isn't too short. I am 5' 7&#34; 175lbs and ordered the XL. It fits me comfortably without being too snug anywhere and comes just above my knee."
4.0,Awesome shirt/dress very comfortable!  Love it
4.0,"A little long, but great fit otherwuse6"
4.0,"I like this bra. It's super soft and suuuuuuper comfortable. The only thing I would have to complain about is just how easy my breast falls out of it. I know, it's a nursing bra...but it's also a sleep bra, and when I sleep on my side, my breast falls out of the less supported side. It doesn't bother me, it's just kind of inconvenient that I can't sleep on one side. Other than that, just like all the other Kindred Bravely products, it's super comfy."
4.0,"Not quite like the original garmin bands, but they are inexpensive and fair quality. The biggest complaint would be the watch band retainer. It doesn't stay in place like the original did."
4.0,Nice looking casual shirt. Can't go wrong here.
4.0,This is well made and looks as it is supposed to. I have a short torso so was able to pull up to just under my bra and have enough material showing under my sweater. It did seem to shrink a little when I washed it so you may want to hang up to dry. Only thing is that I wish the waistband was a little wider as it tends to get a little uncomfortable as the day goes on.
4.0,I thought it would be longer. It took a long time to arrive. I wanted it for fall travel. It’s ok.
4.0,Love the color of the bag is the same color as pictured very bright and pretty . My only complaint would be the since I thought it be bigger but I probally didn't read what the size was . The bag would be good for a student I like my bags pretty big but I am sure I can find something to use it for . It would make a good carry on bag or travel bag for hair or makeup stuff .
4.0,"Does run a little small ,so order it bigger"
4.0,"I love this shirt. It is so pretty. I was worried it was going to look WAY different in person. It looks like the picture. It is a bit too small. I will have to loose weight to fit into it. I was planning on doing that anyway. Took a bit, but worth the wait."
4.0,These gloves are very pretty and appear to be good quality. The only negative thing would be that I wish the finger loops were secured better. I have had to sew them back on both of them. The beads are secure so far.
4.0,"Great product, wash it a couple times before wearing though, or you get lots of 'frizzles' on the shirt underneath."
4.0,"Didn't expect it to be so small, but I love the size and it's a perfect accessory for a beach wedding"
4.0,It was a gift and she really liked it.
4.0,"This was true to size.  I'm really into knee length dresses but many sellers advertise knee length, even as the model is wearing it, and when you get it, is too short and nowhere near the knee.  This dress is as advertised.  Hits me at the knee as I'm tall to begin with. I was a little worried as the back stripes looked uneven and even some reviewers had stated some where like that. Thankfully the one I received looked better than the one the model is wearing.  I think it depends on who's putting the dress together? But this one is a keeper for me."
4.0,Great quality but runs small - definitely order up a size!
4.0,It's classy and trendy . I wear it with long sleeves in the winter and will probably wear it with dresses in the summer too!
4.0,"After reading another reviewer who had it customized, I did the same thing. Sent measurements but dress did not come close to fitting. Too big in waist, built-in bra was pads only, much too small (though I provided my bra size). Was a rush order and seller assured me it would be sent in time, and it was. Prompt communication from seller. Had it altered locally and received many compliments. Thank you!"
4.0,"Good if you are not broad shouldered, fits a size 2 women at most. Links broke immediately when taken out of box.. nothing that couldnt be fixed just annoying.."
4.0,I gave this to my sister and she loved it.  it was so cute and looked good but I'm afraid the chane will break easly. And color rubbs off after a while
4.0,I am pleased and satisfied with this bracelet. I have already recommended this bracelet to my family and planning to order this one for my granddaughter.
4.0,"The garments are very cute and fit decently.  Unfortunately, they reeked of chemicals that smelled like diesel fumes.  I washed the outfit several times but the chemical smell did not come out.  However, I did give the company four stars because they allowed me to return the garments even after the washing."
4.0,This was super flattering with the tie in the front.
4.0,"It is often difficult to find long sleeved options for shirts like this. The hood is definitely a nice touch, and the shirt does provide excellent sun protection. However, the fabric is a little heavier than many of the dry-fit options that are out there, but at this price point, it is about what I expected. A little weight makes a lot of difference. Still, this is nice for cooler weather and a perfect item to bring on a trip to the mountains or for evenings on the beach. The color options are nice, too. This fits pretty true to size and isn't too clingy. Good find!"
4.0,"For 20 bucks these are very pretty. I have been wearing them everyday for over a week and no irritation. The diamonds are more like white, completely opaque and not clear at all. I didn't expect much for 20 dollars and am enjoying them though."
4.0,"Cute dress but if you're like me and little in the middle with much back this dress won't do a darn thing for you.  It's like I have Larry David's pants tent on the small of my back.  If you're more straight up and down or have minimal curves, definitely give this a try.  The fabric and silhouette are nice, just not if you're rather curvy or athletic.  For reference, my measurements are 39x31x42, Usually a medium or large.  Seemingly good quality material and looks just like it does on the site.  Looks like it will fit curvy gals from the image but unfortunately does not.  Sorry to have to return."
4.0,Nice Bling For The Price.... Just add a chain and you are in business.
4.0,The headband does not come attached to the fascinator. It’s better in person than it does online. Decent enough for the picture.
4.0,Would be nice if the mans watch was a little more expandable. Needed one more link but cant find one :(
4.0,"Got these for my friend and I to enjoy, and they're adorable. Not the best quality, but I expected that when I bought them. The chain is a little thicker than I was imagining even with the photo, so if you like thinner chains, these may not be the chains for you."
4.0,"Great product, very satisfied.  I will definitely recommend it.  I gave it 4 stars because of some small scratches in 2 of the replacement lens."
4.0,Logo Easily To Come Off
4.0,"Perfect size for going out when you don't want to take your big pocketbook. Only thing is it had a strange smell when I opened the package,  it did go away but it was yucky."
4.0,"a little small for a medium, I weight 125 lb. and 5&#34;4'. I don't know if a large would be too big or not so keeping the medium."
4.0,The product is welled designed just slides down your face when you turn your neck
4.0,"Very pretty, delicate, and feminine! One of the hooks was bent in shipping I guess but I bent it back. Pink pearls are the classiest...Merry Christmas to me (:"
4.0,"My daughter likes these socks, but I think the advertising is off! I thought they were going to be Nike elites! Oh well."
4.0,I love these gloves! They are great and they let you use your phone
4.0,"The two pack is awesome. The blue is a really beautiful color. It reminds me of a deep ocean blue. There is a bit of flare at the waist. This is nice it hides the little mom pooch I have never been able to shed. There is elastic along the upper back so if you are a little bit bustier there is some stretch. And they gave lots of space to adjust the straps. So, if you have a long torso or are tall or like to show a bit more cleavage all that can be done by adjusting the straps. Now the back does sit low on me so I needed a low riding bra to wear with it. My standard go to one sat above the back of this cami. I did put on a cardigan but then I am usually always cold so this is standard wear for me.  It will show any dampness being the type of material it is. If you sweat at all it is going to show. And they picked up lint from the washing machine. I hung it to dry. But these are a super versatile two pack and I expect I will be wearing them quite a bit."
4.0,"My son likes how it fits him. According to the size chart he thought it would be a bit tight, but was a bit roomy in the chest area. Pants were just right. The cape loops are a bit too large and slip off a few of the buttons easily. Two buttons came off when he wore the costume to a Comiccon. Make sure buttons are securely fastened before wearing. Did tighten the cape loops before he wore it. Did not think to check all the buttons."
4.0,My order came very quickly. Great for the price.
4.0,This product has a great feel to it-very soft! and it fits well too. The sizing is as expected. I love that I can wash and dry this and it still fits as it did the first time. It doesn't shrink up like most sweats do. Awesome buy!
4.0,"At the time of this writing there's no item specific size chart in the item listing, so went with my &#34;normal&#34; Asian size of medium. I'm 34/27/36, 120 lbs, size US small most of the time. The dress was really cute, but much too large for my taste. I would suggest just getting your normal size in this one, maybe even size down. However, in my case I tried belting it which looked ok. The fabric is slightly shiny, which I wasn't expecting. Overall this could be a great everyday dress if you select the correct size, however mine will be returned."
4.0,"Love this top bit rates only four stars because the fabric is very, very thin. Love that my back tats show."
4.0,"The review said to size up one or two, so I ordered one size up, and it fit nicely. The jacket was very thin but for the price, I did not expect anything more. It was exactly what my daughter wanted and worked perfectly for a Halloween costume. The quality is high enough it could be used again by someone else."
4.0,"I really like this dress. I ordered a small. I am 5ft 2 with measurements 36 25 36. My cup size is a 32DDD. It isn't too long, and the quality is good."
4.0,"Great purse, lots of pockets. Looks nice and all the zippers and every thing are working.  I do wish the main opening was bigger, it's not always easy to get my wallet in and out. I like the magnetic snap on the front pocket."
4.0,I used these for a bachelorette party and they were great beach/pool bags!
4.0,Pretty good. Credit card holders not spectacular but ok. Rest is fine.
4.0,"They are not quite as durable as i was expecting, but for the price, they are a good buy"
4.0,Kind of expensive pants just for sleeping but my girl absolutely loves them.
4.0,Wish I could figure out how to keep it from rolling up but other then that it feels great and holds in the roll just above my waist.<br />The price was great and fit exactly to my size.
4.0,"It fits nicely. The size chart tried putting me in a large, but I usually wear a medium. The medium fits just right."
4.0,My daughter loved that these earrings had her initial on them...they were a little smaller than I expected but she has tiny ears so it’s ok.
4.0,okay for the time she was in them!!
4.0,"Cute sweater, it’s quality is about a 7/10. The buttons are sewn on kind of flimsy but besides that, the sweater itself it cute, the eyelet trim is adorable as well. Be advised; I bought a size up and it seemed much larger than expected. Better too big than too small thought, amirite? Comes with the optional “old lady” style pin that removable."
4.0,"I purchased Lavender 1 leotard for my 6-year-old daughter, ordered a size 8 (she currently wears a size 7), and it barely fits her. Not sure whether to hassle and return it and order the next size.. The whole outfit is really cute and pretty though, it's just the sizing that I'm not too happy about. I was planning for her to use this for her Greatest Showman b-day party."
4.0,The fascinator arrived in a timely manner and was just as described. I am happy with my purchase.
4.0,"Nice shirt, design on front is great.  For the price this shirt was a great deal!  I got it for $8, which is great!!"
4.0,"The shoes fit my 11 1/2 feet like a well work baseball mitt (quite nicely)--so to say they run small may be incorrect. I would like to add that the first day I wore them, it rained. Then, I was on my feet all night--walking around the ship (inside) breaking them in. After a couple weeks now they have felt like I 've owned them for much longer than I actually have. I don't think they are authentic Doc's- the label says the were made in China. When I checked D. Marten website the real McCoy's are made of canvas. Personally, I Love 'em. Let's see how the test of time goes."
4.0,Runs a little short / small for tall guys
4.0,Came quickly. The design is great and hopefully the color doesn't rub/wear off quickly. My daughter is not gental on her jewelry.
4.0,Really like the subtle color combinations and feel easy to wear.
4.0,the shirt looks like the picture but it does come very stiff (not as flowy and relaxed as expected)
4.0,"I'm always on the lookout for good quality socks, because I'm constantly rubbing holes in mine, right at the ball of the foot. Since childhood, I've had sensitivity issues . . . I can't stand a thick toe seam or bumps at the ends of the seam. When I was a kid, my mom had to cut off the bumps, which often led to holes in my socks. Even today, it's a problem for me, so when I saw these advertised as &#34;seam-free,&#34; I knew I had to try them.<br /><br />Now, they aren't, in fact, totally seam-free. But they are constructed in such a way that the toe seam is minimal, with almost no ridge and only the slightest bumps at the ends of the seams. I can wear them without any trouble, which is a huge relief. Of course, it helps if your shoes are actually wide enough so they don't put pressure against the sock bumps. I wear a double-wide, and if my shoes actually are WW, it's not as much of a problem as if my shoes are too narrow and press against the sides of my toes.<br /><br />These socks are the kind with fold-over cuffs, which is exactly what I was looking for. They're very soft, which is nice. I believe they're mostly cotton, with a bit of nylon and lycra, which is good---the cotton allows your feet to breathe, while the lycra means they actually stay up, without sagging. They stretch well, although they may be a little snug the first time you wear them, just because they haven't stretched out yet.<br /><br />The only issue I have with these socks is their thickness. They're noticeably heavier than my regular socks. Not as thick as winter (boot) socks, but definitely thicker than my normal socks. So far, it hasn't caused any problems, but if I switch to snugger shoes, they might be too thick. On the other hand, this might mean they won't wear through at the ball of the foot, like all my regular socks do. So it might end up being a blessing in disguise, we'll see!<br /><br />Four stars and highly recommended to anyone who has sensitive feet and needs socks that don't have a ridged seam across the toes."
4.0,"These are nice, but even with snow pants covering the shoe top, one of my son's feet/ boot was completely soaks at the toes:( A traditional taller thicker toe snow boot is what I will stick with in the future"
4.0,Beautiful I'm 5&#34;6 200 pounds thick in the thighs and overall fits nicely the top is confusing does not come the way the picture shows
4.0,These are really pretty and they come with a battery. Good value!
4.0,"The design overall is very pretty, but the gold color is more like a shiny mustard color."
4.0,Very cute and durable. Runs bigger than expected.
4.0,"Soft, fuzzy and comfortable 💕 love em<br />Fit great 💕💕💕"
4.0,"Very pretty,  but runs small."
4.0,I love the bracelet but I'm having a hard time matching the color with my outfits but I will. Again this one is small like the black one I bought from the same place INBLUE. Still overall it was a good buy.
4.0,People need to specify which dress they are leaving a review for. I ordered the dark dress with the little sparrows. I actually sized down and it fits great. I will need to pin the top to keep it from opening up all the way. Not a big deal. The pattern is beautiful. The fabric is what's expected. Polyester. Very hot for summer weather.
4.0,Love this dress. Got lots of compliments.
4.0,Great product for the price! Very tight though.
4.0,"I got this in XXL and it's still too small. It would probably fit better if it didn't have so much fluffy insulation on the inside. I am able to zip it up, but I'm not able to layer underneath it like I wanted to. Order it at least 2 sizes bigger than you usually get something"
4.0,"We ordered the red, description says red and we got the blue. It was disappointing because we ordered a hat to go with the red. My son was disappointed but he loves the fit and coming to terms with it"
4.0,The flower one is pretty big but the others are super cute
4.0,"very pleased!  much less neck pain after years of trying to read or watch tv in bed, and only after a few nights.<br /><br />what would make it better:  lighter plastic as it's a bit heavy, and get rid of the bridge and make it more like a goggle for better viewing."
4.0,It’s too large. Look same as 6 months cloths.
4.0,Had to return it because I have a long torso and waist line was just a bit to short for the upper to fit correctly.<br />Fun nice dress just not for my long build.
4.0,I was not sure if it would fit my head but it does and I love how it looks. It easily dresses up a simple dress or any outfit.
4.0,"Looks exactly like the pictures. It was cute! I did return it, however, because the neck line was weird. I had to adjust it to make it look right, but then it was tight in my armpits and uncomfortable."
4.0,The color a d fabric were very nice
4.0,Dress fits well but the sleeves are too small
4.0,"I got these for my daughter. They are a little bit big, but I just layer socks with them. They keep her foot nice and dry. The colors are wonderful, with a little bit of whimsy. Traction is very good. This will be a great shoe for springtime."
4.0,My wife loves these boots and have to change the batteries often because she uses them a lot.
4.0,"It’s a great dress for the price. I generally wear a large but ordered an XL as I have a large bust and am also 5’10”. It’s not quite as long as I would like but it’s really close! The material feels great. It’s a little thin. My only real complaint is a big one. The beige is NOT beige. Not even close. It’s pale yellow, maybe could be called “gold” and should be advertised as such. I like yellow but I was really looking for something beige or off white and this won’t cut it"
4.0,"Not bad for the price but it seems my beck is too small for these, even if I put the clasp in the tightest loop"
4.0,These are great and are as their pictures portray. I get plenty of compliments when I wear them. Very lightweight.
4.0,"This dress is very cute and feels nice.  The pockets are a bonus!  I'm 5'2"" and the dress is VERY long on me.  I tried knotting it, but can't seem to make it work.  The dress is cute enough that I'm going to try to figure it out!"
4.0,"Love the bathing suit it's self. Bottom and top for great. I'm 5'4"" and about 150 36B and ordered the XL. Great fit not to loose and not to tight. The tank top is very snug though. Goes on but just tight. I think it's a medium or large. That's the only reason for a 4 star not a five. The colors are perfect for this suit."
4.0,"The dress is very pretty but a bit tight across the shoulders and loose in the waist area. It looks good, but the shoulder area is a little uncomfortable."
4.0,Very beautiful selection! I like that it even came with a little case! Giving 4 stars because they run a little small. The flares are not much bigger than 0g so I’m a little concerned with them falling out. The wooden ones are even smaller. They are still wearable for me so I plan to keep them.
4.0,"Very easy to put on, but runs very small in the cup size.  Think you would have to be a A or B for this to hold your breats."
4.0,"Looks great with heels, boots, wedges or flats ! Comfortable to wear. A little tight through the thighs but I’m a little heavier there than I should be for my waist size"
4.0,"Cute bracelet, easy to adjust, colors are great and comfortable.<br /><br />Update: Wore it everyday 24/7 and it kinda died (broke on one side) after about 4 months. Probably would have lasted longer if I took it off in the shower, watching dishes, etc. But it was a great bracelet while it lasted."
4.0,Very cute dress! Fit a little larger than expected. I wanted it for going out but it seems a bit more like a church dress to me.
4.0,The fabric was very pretty and the fit was good.
4.0,"This dress has light fabric with floral designs as shown on the photo.  I'm barely 5'0&#34; so it's no surprise that this dress was slightly too large, but I probably could have pulled it off length wise.  I did return it because it made me feel like I was wearing an apron, given how roomy it was on the shoulder/chest area, but it is a nice casual dress for anyone that's slightly taller than 5'0&#34;!"
4.0,5'11&#34; 165lbs- large fits right.<br />Black collects dog hair like a magnet<br />Comfortable and gives some breathing room where needed
4.0,Very pretty shirt.  I usually wear an xl for comfiness but it does fit tighter than most xl shirts.
4.0,These are the cuttes earrings.  They really stand out. not to big or to small. The ball on the back of the earring was some what challengeing to get off but once i was able to loosen it was all good. So i know nothing about 16G but these worked fine in my cartilage peirceing. i will say I had to really push them thru and yeah it did hurt but it was tolerable. so far very pleased.
4.0,"Good quality, color true to picture, and roomy fit for big heads like mine...I have a large head plus I wear clip-ins and wigs which makes my head hard to fit for hats but this worked great. Would recommend and buy again"
4.0,"These sunglasses are so pink you'll feel like a Barbie girl wearing them. This is because the pink lenses are huge and unlike typical sunglasses, have bee glued over the metal frames themselves, covering them. They are oversized and make a great fashion statement. I also like the faux leather case they came in - it's white with ""Skyway"" imprinted in gold. They are not polarized so I wouldn't wear them in brightly lit environments but they do have 100% UV protection. These would be great to wear as an everyday pair of sunglasses, or when you want to make a fashion statement."
4.0,I am very happy with this purse and wallet. Color is great and can fit a bunch in it or keep it with only a few things. It is a little bigger than I thought and a little more heavy (even with no items).
4.0,"They're a little tight on my head, but do have good lenses.  They could do better to increase the flex in the glasses."
4.0,I'm giving it a four because it was very pretty and also I received it on time. But the size it's at least 2 sizes too small if not 3.
4.0,"It’s a very comfortable, attractive bra which fits very good."
4.0,"Great price, but runs small, even at the thigh."
4.0,"I followed the suggestions on the reviews and feel I would be been more suited for a Med. I do think you need to pay attention to your body shape if you’re teetering in M to L.<br />I’m 5’5 135 hourglass shape 36 C to 34 D.<br />This is baggy on my boobs (but not awful.) and arms are a tad large, the under boob waist come a bit below where it was intended to be. However, it’s comfy, loose, no feelings of constriction at all. Length falls right at my knees. Disclaimer, I just recently lost a lot of weight and have sagging skin, that might effect how I’m fitting in this."
4.0,Very nice shirt. Good value
4.0,Cute hat. Works well. Only thing I don’t like is the wires sticking out around the brim. On the fence about it.
4.0,I love this brand and the fit of the product. They have so many colors and for the most part they are squat proof. They are a thicker fabric but they are moisture wicking and fairly breathable. They can get a little hot depending on what activities you are doing. The only real thing that knocked a star off was that the second pair I ordered the seams on the bottom of both leg were unraveling and the gems were coming apart to I had to return them. I am hoping the replacement pair will be better.
4.0,Fit was good but sleeves pattern is a bit odd looking to me.  just doesn't really fit with the rest of the top.  Love the color though so will wear it to piddle around in.
4.0,"There are only two reasons I am not giving this item 5 stars. For starters, it is a ""one-size fits all"" item. I am 4'10 and 95 lbs and although I like my clothes a little over-sized, this is significantly over-sized for me; however, it is so cute that I'm determined to make it work. Also, the colors are NOT how they are pictured. I feel like I almost received a different shirt from the one I ordered because the colors are so different, but it is still very cute, I'm not mad about it at all and I would probably order again."
4.0,"5'2&#34; this dress is cute true to size but a little long, a simple hem will fix."
4.0,They are cute kinda made cheaply. But cute and will work for the month
4.0,"Arrived quickly, colors are accurately shown in photo, bigger piece than I expected but quite lovely. Not crazy about the chain but can swap that out."
4.0,My first response was made too hastily. I brought them for my wife and they look very nice. Thanks for made in America!!<br /><br />Mitchell Black
4.0,Very small and dainty...
4.0,"I have long (but still above the bra strap) and very thin curly hair. So not much hair, really. I wear a protective silk or satin bonnet when I sleep. The quality of this cap seems very good, but even though I don't have a lot of hair, this bonnet is too small and squishes my curls flat. So if you have shoulder length or higher hair, and it's thin, this would work for you. Or, if you have straight hair and wear it in a high bun, this will work. But for longer curly hair, it's a no go. 4 stars for material and quality. 2 stars for usability."
4.0,Ordered a large... for some reason the top wasn’t laying right... But I also ordered it in why and that was fine... Not bad for the price!
4.0,"Fits perfect. Very comfortable. I like the softcup inserts with no underwire. The ruffles though... Not overly flattering if you're top heavy and kind of makes me feel like a Spanish cupcake. The top ruffle really sticks out on the chest making you really look larger up there, and then the fabric just kind of hangs down. Would be flattering for a small chest I think, but I'm assuming, like me, most people shop for miraclesuit/magicsuit specifically to look slimmer...?<br /><br />Weird to have all that fabric floating around. I love the cut and comfort of the top, but not how it looks or functions. I returned it. Too expensive for a suit that looks so...odd."
4.0,"If you&#34;re looking for a dress belt, this isn't the one. It was a little wider than I expected, but durable for everyday wear."
4.0,"Comfortable, nice color. Good long length in torso and arms. Barely wrinkled after being vacuum packed. If. you're between a small and medium, go with small because this medium was a little too baggy in the belly."
4.0,They are very comfortable and warm.
4.0,I like the gel material and the durability seems to be good. I just wish the lines to write on were a little bit larger.
4.0,"The only reason this gorgeous dress is getting a 4 star rating is because the buttons and seems came off/ apart very easily. When it came to how it fit though, it felt as if it was made for me. It fit perfectly in every part of my body. It is extremely cute, and looks great with some pearls. Highly recommend this, but I would tighten to buttons on the chest part if you don't want to lose any."
4.0,"I do like the pendant; I've ordered this product before. Problem is the stones fall out after a while. For the price, you can't beat it."
4.0,Very flattering. Just as described!
4.0,A pretty bracelet but unfortunately the fit is iffy. Mine arrived loose and stretched out so it doesn’t lay right on my wrist. Thinking about returning it. Disappointed.
4.0,They fit great into my glasses. I needed them when I drove out of town.  I didn’t want to wear my contacts because Your eyes become tired after a while.  They are worth buying
4.0,It’s a nice size and very roomy
4.0,Way too long (FYI I&#34;m 5'4&#34;) but fit elsewhere. Slightly see-through but feel great on.
4.0,Runs really big. My son is 3.5 yes old 32lbs. Waist or suit is way too big
4.0,"I love the bracelet, but I found it odd that when I first put it on I couldn't get it wet or the colors on some of the beads would stain my wrists. They are definitely sprayed with something to get them to look shiny I guess, which surprised me. I wouldn't have expected genuine beads to have dye on them. It made me question how authentic they were, but eventually it stopped staining my skin. The beads are still colorful.<br /><br />I have average size wrists. They are not tiny by any means, but this bracelet is huge on me. It keeps slipping to the bottom of my wrist and I have to pull it up higher on my arm so it doesn't fall. It's great for huge wrists!"
4.0,"I bought two of these Kukui nut necklaces to use them as worry beads since they have such a nice texture and smooth feel that I find relaxing. They were from two different sellers and this particular one was a little less polished than the other I purchased and although it was nice, it did not have that soothing feeling to it. The necklace is nice and long and I presently have it displayed."
4.0,Hot a lot of compliments. Lightweight. Kind of long so not for very young girls.
4.0,Straps were a little loose but I love it!
4.0,Doesnt Match picture spot on but Still looks awesome.good for cosplay.
4.0,"Fit was exactly what I was looking for, very cute! Material was a bit cheap feeling, but not awful."
4.0,"Quality good, price is fair. I bought this glove last year, unfortunately I could only use it a few times. Very comfortable and also worked well with the phone. I recommended."
4.0,"first of all I love the quality of this denim dress is absolutely good. aside from the cute design the stitches and fabric looks like it is  going to last years. I know why only 4 stars if its that good. This runs small. for me as a buyer, sizing is very important. returning products usually a hassle for me.  I usually wear dress in between 10 and 12. I took a risk trying this thinking maybe it have room to stretch. but not much. I suggest ordering 2 sizes up if you don't want it too tight. I wish they have more sizes.<br />UPDATE:<br />I gave it to a 12 year old daughter of my friend, she said she wear 12-15<br />junior she wears 9. her height is 4'10"
4.0,Could be a little looser across the shoulders . . . Otherwise a gorgeous dress!
4.0,"Great product, very durable. Adjustable strap, very nice. I love that on the inside there is a zipper, and pockets. Only thing I had a problem with was the size of the inside. I am a high school student and need to put folders and sometimes binders in it. It does fit folders and binders, but you can't zip it. Also, I love Metallica with all my heart, but ""Seek and Destroy"" is not even close to my favorite song. I suggest that you make the bag more general, or make more bags with different song/album names. Other than that, I am really loving this bag."
4.0,"Product is OK, but sizes run way too large."
4.0,"I would have to agree with others reviewers that these Cuff links are great looking! I can not wait to wear them; I've just received them so I haven't had the opportunity to wear them just yet. I don't know how long the gloss will last but for now they look very expensive. I don't think you will be disappointed in your purchase. If you are looking for great looking but inexpensive Cuff links then you should consider this set. Classic, that's another reason to consider this set."
4.0,"Dress is as described - great fit. Loved the materiel, very soft and comfortable."
4.0,"Not sure how much it slims, but I have found this is amazing to wear when my back feels like it's going to go out. Gives me just a little bit of support that I need. And the surprise was that it didn't get stinky as I imagined it would. Very easy to clean also. I was handwashing until it accidentally got in the regular laundry. Came out fine!"
4.0,It looks nice and fits well. Served its purpose exactly as it should have. The bill was a bit lower quality and the gold studs around the front were a bit rough.
4.0,"These crew socks are well made, not too thin or too thick. I feel comfy wearing them in boots. However, it is a little bit pricey for a pair of cotton blended socks."
4.0,Love these! Great product and service. Had to order the bigger size because of the size of my calf...a little big on the toes.
4.0,Love it!! Well worth it for the $$
4.0,"Love this dress, just ordered 2 more. Ordered small instead of medium this time"
4.0,"Necklace is the perfect length and the bow is the perfect size...not too big, not too small. It’s adorable, I love it! The clasp feels a little cheap, but overall I’m very pleased with this item. :-)"
4.0,So cute skirt....material is also good.
4.0,"The watch itself is great, though the watchband is too small for an adult man's wrist.."
4.0,"These are actually pretty good quality in terms of lens shading.  The lense probably allow about 50% transmission.  The frame is pretty minimal and overall the glasses are light.  The lens are definitely polarized as I tested it in conjunction with another polarized glasses (when you put two glasses 90 degree offset, there should be zero light transmission).  There is also a reflective picture included that also showcases the polarized effect.  My only minor complaint is that the clear plastic pieces that rest on your nose are pretty mobile and have a small footprint.  This puts a bit of pressure on my nose and gets uncomfortable over time for me (like after 3+ hours of use though).<br />Please note that I was provided a sample for my honest and unbiased review."
4.0,Good value for the price. Seem well made. I use a ear savers that hook onto the string ear straps. Relives the strain on my ears.
4.0,Great style just a little hard to set
4.0,"The first item I purchased was the perfect size for my husband, but the second was a bit small and fits tight. He's not using it. :( Good quality."
4.0,This hat is soft and warm. The ear flaps keep my ears warm and aren’t tight. The gloves are soft and have great grips to hold my phone. The first finger allows you to type on your phone. You do have to use the tip of it though. I recommend these.
4.0,"This bra is pretty and inexpensive.  It looks very pretty on.  The cups are full coverage.  I'm not sure it really is minimizing anything either though.  I like the fact that it has plenty of hooks in the back and is supportive.  Fabric is a bit rough around my torso, so again, I don't think it's something I'd want to wear as an every day bra.  It was inexpensive enough that I'll keep it and just wear it when I want to wear something with a little more ""oomph"" than my day to day bras.  Cups do not give my breasts a weird shape, which is also nice and difficult to find in a larger size bra.  Finally, it is unlined and a soft cup, which again, is extremely difficult to find in any bra these days, but especially in larger sizes.  Oh, finally, for reference, I wear a 40DD."
4.0,Those lines done like but the rest it’s amazing good !💪🏽👍🏼
4.0,"This dress is super cute, comfy, and the perfect thing to throw on when it’s hot out and you have a million things to do with your day. The only issue is that it runs VERY small. I’m typically a size small (5’4’’, 125 pounds, not particularly curvy) and the large is pretty snug and hits about mid thigh rather than closer to the knee as advertised. Fabric is a little thin but flesh toned under garments can’t be seen while you’re wearing the dress."
4.0,I get a little wind leaking by my nose piece and it hits me in the eye but they are very comfortable.
4.0,"These are lovely earrings. I bought them to replace my last everyday pair that wore out. I like them, but they are very shiny and bright silver whereas the photos look more dull which is what I wanted. Maybe a few months of wear and hairspray will fix that!😂"
4.0,"Ordered the small size (I'm 5'6, 130lbs); the shirt fit fine but I would've preferred the sleeves 1/2"" longer. Additionally, the waist did not taper so it was a bit looser there for me. I'm returning bc found another brand that fit better and was cheaper."
4.0,"Adorable,  although a bit small."
4.0,"I like it. But it was a little large than I expected.<br />And the ziper pocket is already damaged, and i swear i havent put anything big into the pocket.<br />But ok.. Still VERY usefull and good for organizing stuff into my backpack!"
4.0,"I love these pants! Size 3 is a little too tight and size 5 fall off of me. So, size 4 was the perfect size for me. I'm 5 feet tall, but have longer legs for my size. These jeans were perfect in leg length and were definitely high waisted. The crotch area was much lower on me that might be for others. The bell bottoms weren't as big as I thought they were. The belt got in my way with every shirt I paired with it so I didn't wear the belt. I'm recently new to having a colostomy bag and these jeans covered every bit of it. The only thing bad I can say about these jeans are they were slightly too high waisted for me. They literally came up about an inch and a half away from my chest."
4.0,"It's very nice, but it's a minibolso; I use it because it's very cute"
4.0,"very cute and exactly like the photo and descriptions provided. Comfortable on my face and super stylish and sexy. I love the cat eye, they are my go to sun glasses. I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review."
4.0,The belt was not as wide as I thought and the buckle was a lot smaller than the regular western belt buckles.<br />But it's an awesome looking belt. The size/length is perfect and the quality is superb.<br />I'm in a performing line dance group and we always wear blingy belts with big buckles to match our outfits and Amazon is where I get all my blingy belts!!<br />Thank you!
4.0,"Very visible, easy to spot. Just too many, had to share with friends and family :-)))"
4.0,"For the price, these work very well.  We use them to protect our eyes on cloudy days when we are racing small sailboats."
4.0,beautiful but beads come flying off if you're not paying attention... pay attention. hahaha!
4.0,My daughter says these work really well.  She is on her feet all day as a veterinary technician.
4.0,Love the low cut feel of this. The soft plastic on the heel of the sock (assuming to keep my foot from slipping is a little irritating to me) .. which is why I gave it 4 stars
4.0,"I ordered this dress for my baby shower. For some reason I thought it would look cute on me but no. I feel like this dress might fit a more skinny/narrow woman better instead. If you're heavier and it fit you great, good for you. I felt it made me look huge and very old lady like even though I was going for a vintage style. This dress is really cute, don't get me wrong. It just didn't work for my larger frame especially being pregnant. Also the collar on the back sticks up and is a little odd.<br />I'd suggest this to a more petite woman, it IS really cute. I returned the item and the refunded me, which was awesome."
4.0,"I sized up based on other reviews and experience. I could have probably gone down a size in the top's body, but the cups aren't quite big enough to be super functional and supportive in the one I have so sizing down would have been an issue.  It still looks nice and flatters the rest of my body, I just won't be running on the beach in this."
4.0,They help with the bike-ride in the morning. The lenses switch out as needed.
4.0,"Being it comes from China, expect to order a size or 2 larger than what you want. But very nice product."
4.0,"It's way too short! I'm 5'3&quot; and it barely covers my butt. Luckily I was wearing this with a huge tulle skirt for a one of a kind outfit, so it's not a huge deal... but if I wasn't I would definitely be returning it. Had a bit of zipper problem, but it's stretchy enough that you can leave it zipped and just slip it over your head. The lace neckline is absolutely beautiful up close and it really does look much more expensive than it is. If it had been a bit longer like the picture shows I would have given 5 stars."
4.0,"These glasses are great for driving. They significantly reduce the blue tones, glare, & sunshine. I even use them for night driving. The only reason i did not give them 5 stars is because the side logo fell off on the first day wearing them. The quality could be better, & they are a bit uncomfortable after wearing them for a few hours...but<br />For the price, they are good & do what they are supposed to do."
4.0,"The top should be closed more...  doesn't close enough and you must wear a white cami or your breast will surely be out!!  Other than that, I must say I loved this dress."
4.0,"I liked it, was cute on but my daughter (she is 18) felt it was too long so we returned it....Was really cute on, fit true to size"
4.0,"they are as advertised but they are a little small for anyone with a larger head or females with lots of hair. that is why they get four stars, not five"
4.0,I like it but...the purse is nice but the smell is very strong..I received the handbag but the clip on  long strap<br />On one side is missing..I hope the company sees the review and email me or send me another long strap.<br />I was going to buy another one but I will wait till I receive answer from the company.
4.0,I love the look of these earrings. They were just what I wanted as well as a great value for the money.
4.0,"The length of the top/bust is awkward. It goes a bit past the waist... somewhere between the waist and hip, not a typical waistline which was not flattering on me."
4.0,"love the product, however the size will not work for me as i am a small woman and it will not stay up over my nose, wish it came in sizes,"
4.0,I bought this shirt not only to encourage others but myself. The message is simple but powerful. The material is soft and the color is versatile . I did find it a tad shorter than I'd like and a bit more snug than I'm use to.
4.0,"I am 5'5&#34; and busty, this dress fit great in a small. No gaping and my husband liked it and said it looked fun!"
4.0,Like it very much.  Love the cover zipper.  2 major compartments in purse.  Usual phone pockets on one side and side zippered pocket on other.  The lining material is an easy cheap clean.  Not bad for price
4.0,Beautiful dress. Chest area was on the small size.  Well made though and fit well everywhere else
4.0,"I like how they block UV and sunlight, my eyes are very sensitive. The earpieces press in on my head , slightly uncomfortable. Overall, I’m very pleased with the value and utility of these sunglasses."
4.0,Love it!! It arrived on time. It fit me perfectly!! I'm 5.7 140 lbs and got medium. I love it!!!
4.0,I would give five stars because the strap is excellent quality...except it’s not really made for wide wayfarers! Mine barely fit but beware!
4.0,"This doesn't seem like a true Fruit of the Loom brand product, the fabric is thinner, the stitching seems less sturdy, yet it fits well.  You do need to size up. Example: a U.S. women's size 14 = an XXL.  I normally wear a size 16 but this fit fine because of a decent stretch.  It has a good cut, a woman's figure cut, not a man's boxy shape.  I love the bright colors.  I got the yellow and it's a nice bright saturated YELLOW!"
4.0,"Quality seems nice, though the snap between compartments, look like it could be a problem quickly."
4.0,"I liked my dress, it is very versatile.  Looks just like the picture, easy to wash and dry."
4.0,Pretty true to size I can wear a 10-12 in most brands but I got a large. Love the fit and looks great.
4.0,Awesome & cheap! Look like my Ray bans and people can't tell they're not expensive.
4.0,Beautiful...fits perfect
4.0,"I really like the design of this Women's Ultra Soft Fleece Tri-Color Chevron Pullover Hoodie Sweatshirt. The tri-color chevron is very attrractive (and reminds me a little of Charlie Brown, not that the chevron stripe on his shirt helped him any).<br />The Large size was too small for my 5'5"" 212 lb frame, but I think that is typical for the sizing on Amazon. And too bad, because I would have loved to be able to wear this!"
4.0,"I like my robe a lot, but it's super short.  Don't plan on wearing this while guests are over!  It's nice and breezy for summer weather.  I especially like to wear it when the hair dryer heat would otherwise be too much to handle."
4.0,"These are well made, somewhat thick socks. They are not long enough to be worn with Bean Boots, but they are thin enough to comfortably be worn under skinny jeans or jeggings. Some colors seemed to be roomier than others, but I found them to be on the small side overall."
4.0,Didn’t know the sweater comes with sound effects!  Love it!
4.0,"I love the fabric and the feel. Just a touch too small at the bodice, but it falls nicely."
4.0,"My son loves these dinosaur robot masks, but the seams are not very straight. They look a little off but other than that, they have everything we’re looking for - a great fit and a filter pocket."
4.0,"There is no point in this sweater having a hood... bad design. Fits well though, but the collar is itchy. For the price, i suppose it should be expected."
4.0,"They came a little longer than expected  in comparison to another adidas pants I purchased in the same size ( that one was actually a little short), but i guess it's better to be too long than too short.  The fabric and quality are very good.  My son loves his pants."
4.0,"Love, love love these pj's. I have 4 pair now, don't sleep in anything else. Very comfortable ."
4.0,Really nice. Except if you order a size small you won't get small. I went through this 3 times. Each time they sent me an X-L. Had to send back and just didn't order no more.
4.0,"good hat for the money, fits my smaller head, strap in the back adjusts but sticks out in the back. It arrived on time, in good condition, and matches my sunflower backpack set nicely."
4.0,Just what I was looking for. My kids (ages 6 and 8) say they work great and protect their hands while using the monkey bars at recess
4.0,Don't let the XL scare you. I wear size 8 jeans and this suit fits great.  Top is flattering even though age and child bearing years set a mark on this body.
4.0,"Dress fits large. Ordered a medium, I’m usually a size 6, and it fits very baggy. Not as fitted like the picture. Order a size down."
4.0,"I love the fit of these and how high they come up. I was worried the material would show every imperfection but it didn't. There was a smell to the pants when first received, but after washing they were fine."
4.0,I thought it was women size and asked for a large but it wasn't so the large was too large.<br />I should have ordered medium
4.0,"They could be a bit bigger, but they are very delicate and pretty.  Subtle enough to go with anything."
4.0,"I have tested both pairs in my vehicle while driving and I can say that both of them offer vision corrections that I cannot find in some store brands.  The construction appears to be solid, but I have one complaint in that fog will form in the upper part of the lens.  Usually I have to pull the glasses away from my face so that it does not trap air released from my mouth or nose.  I really think that some venting across the nose bridge would be appropriate."
4.0,"They are nice earrings, lightweight. The detail is pretty small and you can't really see it when they're in but the thing I didn't like was the fact that it took nearly a month to get them. So don't order these if you want them inside a month. Also, the price dropped $2 right after I ordered them."
4.0,Bought it as a gift to my friend and he absolutely loved it
4.0,Wearing around the house and garden.
4.0,"It is realy nice, but quality not so good"
4.0,"Heads-up: This is a long review and includes suggestions for improvements that I personally would make as well as improvements or modifications that I feel are necessary to avoid having an annoying costume. Overall this is a pretty great costume and really only NEEDS a couple of modifications (tack sew the collar so it isn't floppy, make padded arm bands so the sleeves actually poof out, and use a different petticoat). Read on for a LOT more detail. (and check back for an updated review including before and after pics once I have made the modifications I feel are necessary)<br /><br />As an added note for my kid friendly Disney cosplayers: THE PROVIDED HOOP SKIRT IS VERY MUCH NOT KID FRIENDLY. If you are the type to sit on the floor and hug kids and let them sit with you, the hoop skirt will do nothing but cause problems and stand a chance at damaging your costume. I'm actually not sure why a simple fluffy petticoat wasn't provided, rather than a bulky hoop skirt. Skip the hoop skirt and buy a soft petticoat (or skip the underskirt all together if that's your style).<br /><br />I am a competitive cosplayer, but have resolved to purchase cosplays to wear if I don't intend on competing in them, rather than spend time and money (and stress) making them myself. This is the first cosplay I have ever purchased online and I have to say that I am very pleasantly surprised! Of course, the biggest issue was the skirt needing to be ironed out. Because of the material type and the amount of material, it took me a while, but it was a near instant improvement on the look of the cosplay overall, so be sure to iron that skirt out with your iron set no hotter than the ""Silk"" setting!<br /><br />I ordered a XL when I am normally a Medium/Large (in stores that run small on sizes) and the costume fit pretty comfortably. It is a little loose for my tastes and I am intending on losing weight, but I can easily take it in when the time comes. If you are about my size and you prefer comfort over form, I definitely suggest you stick with the XL. It is just my personal preference to look like I am about to compete in a pro contest. If you're more like me, then I'd go with the L. I just don't want to bother with the return and re-send shipping process over something that anyone other than myself is unlikely to notice.<br /><br />The costume itself is surprisingly weighty. Unlike costumes that you buy during Halloween, this costume feels like it can stand up to some serious wearing. Halloween costumes feel like I am wearing tissue paper and feel like they'll fall apart at the smallest hint of moisture. The velvet like material is pretty good quality throughout. The satin like skirt is a little bit difficult as it is somewhat sheer, but this issue can be fixed with a white or yellow underskirt or a better quality petticoat. I am 5'3"" and about 140lbs like the headline says. This is important information because the skirt JUST kissed the ground while I was walking around my house wearing the dress. If you are on the shorter side like myself and need to order a L, XL, or XXL then I suggest you either get the skirt hemmed up OR wear some shoes with small heels just to avoid letting the skirt touch the ground. Even with the provided hoop skirt on, the skirt of the dress was still considerably close to the ground, enough so that I'd be hiking it up and walking like a maniac if I was outside or near anything that may wet or stain the material.<br /><br />The collar is a bit floppy, but this can be easily fixed by just sewing tacks in on the bottom corners. The same can be said for the sleeves as they are 100% flop and no poof at all. I will need to fix this by making my own inserts. I will update my review later with before and after pictures once I have done this.<br /><br />I do have complaints about the bow headband and the petticoat/hoop skirt. The bow is a bit large for my taste. It looks comical and childish, which is not the kind of look I'd like personally (it simply doesn't suit my face shape. If you have a rounder face shape, then it should look just fine on you :) I just have harder lines and a defined jaw is all). I will need to make my own headband, but that is not a big deal. I'll see if I can just modify the headband that came with the dress without mutilating it, but I have concerns that the material won't cooperate easily. At the very least, the bow is movable on the headband! So if you prefer to wear the bow off center or want to use it for other cosplays that may need the bow off center, you can still comfortably wear the headband correctly and simply scoot the bow over to where you need it to be.<br /><br />As for the petticoat, it is extremely cheap compared to the quality of the costume. I am actually pretty disappointed in that aspect. The Ribbons that are used to tie it off around your waist are not nearly long enough for me to get a secure knot tied in. In order to have a secure knot, I had to pull it uncomfortably tight which made the already difficult task of sitting down nearly impossible due to the discomfort. To add to it, the netting material used on the outside of the hoop skirt that is supposed to help smooth the skirt of the dress out over the form is extremely stiff and defeats it's own purpose by being extremely visible underneath the skirt of the dress. It also is not long enough to create that cute bell shape like what is pictured in the listing (the skirt bells out until the last 8 or so inches, then it's like a sheer drop off straight down because there is no longer a petticoat to support it. I even wiggled the petticoat down so that it was as low on my hips as it could go and I still had that straight drop off with the skirt due to the petticoat not being long enough). I have a feeling that this petticoat is a 1 size deal as other reviews that I read for this costume in a smaller size said that the skirt of the dress fit too tightly on the petticoat. Aside from the short length, my skirt fit perfectly around this petticoat. This seems like a seller issue that may need to be addressed as petticoats and hoop skirts really aren't an appropriate item to make a ""One Size Fits All"" deal for the exact problems named in my review and in reviews left by others who purchased a smaller size. I will either need to modify this petticoat heavily, purchase a different petticoat, make my own, or go without it all together.<br /><br />I do wish the cape was separate from the costume as it will make dealing with the heat somewhat difficult. I also would have preferred a larger cape personally to go with the look in the movie. This is something I may or may not fix in time for an upcoming con, but I WILL be fixing in the long run. The cape seems to just be sewn on top of the bodice part of the dress, so it will hopefully be as simple as seam ripping the existing cape off and making my own, detachable, larger cape out of a couple of yards of similar material.<br /><br />If you want the dress to fit snug like in the picture, then you will need to pin it in the back. The velvet like material is somewhat stretchy, so do be aware of that fact. The cape at least offers a way to hide those pins and, with the zipper being on the side instead of the back, it makes it easy for you to get out of the costume quickly regardless of the pins (so for those of you who may suffer from anxiety or panic attacks and sometimes NEED to get out of a costume RIGHT NOW, I can assure you that this cosplay will suit your needs even if you want to pin it up in the back to make it more form fitting. Just make sure you do not accidentally pin it to any shape-wear or undershirts you may be wearing underneath).<br /><br />All in all, I do want to leave 4/5 stars because at least the parts that I DO have a problem with are minor, considering, and not complicated. It's easy to make padded arm bands for poofy sleeves, easy to do thread tacks to make something hold its shape, and easy enough to buy a petticoat and make a new headband. Had the dress itself had any other issues aside from the not poofy sleeves and floppy collar, I'd have to lower my rating. As a (very) competitive cosplayer, I am actually very proud and comfortable to wear this costume."
4.0,"This helmet was used for a church play, so we needed a cheap option.  At around $5, this helmet looked great.  We had to have a replacement, because the first shipment was missing the red-feather mohawk piece, but they shipped another, no problems!  Thanks!"
4.0,"This is a quality bag. I use this bag for my surface pro 4 and it feels like it was built for the surface and it's accessories. However, the bag doesn't not stand by itself. But that is to be expected from a canvas bag. The bottom padding is not as thick as I was hoping for, but is enough for my needs. For the price, you get the most value with this bag."
4.0,Bought these to wear for my first year anniversary dinner! Super cute and for the price I would say these are definitely worth it. Yes there was a little glue spot on one part of the outer heel but once I put on you can no longer see the spot. I am always a true size US women’s 7 and these are a little tight but feel a bit stretchy and if you take your time to put on they will fit and comfortably. I would have ordered a size 8 but they didn’t come in an 8 so I will keep my size 7 as my feet are narrow and can fit comfortably. If you have a wider foot I suggest you order a size up. Cute as my really expensive transparent heels i bought from Nordstrom’s and only 1/4 of the price. I will defiantly be ordering more heels from MackinJ in the future.
4.0,"Looks just like the photos.  I should've paid closer attention to them though.  It's slightly wider and taller than I actually wanted.  I was hoping for something closer to the actual size (length and width) of my credit cards which obviously, this is not.  But not a bad purchase.  Quality seems nice too."
4.0,"I'm not used to wearing oversized dresses and didn't know how I felt about the fit. It was definitely loose. I'm 4'11, 103 lbs and the Small was loose but surprisingly the length was good, hit mid-thigh. I tried it with a belt  but looked odd because the chest area was too wide. I ended up wearing without a belt and just paired it with 4&#34; wedges. Got compliments on it all day at work."
4.0,"This umbrella is very classy and professional.  I have not had a windy, rainy day to test out the resistance to turning inside out, but my experience with other Procella umbrellas have been very positive. My only criticism of this umbrella that prevented me from giving it 5 stars is that the button to open/close the umbrella is not easily identifiable without looking at the actual arm of the umbrella and I have trouble feeling any indentation to locate the button."
4.0,"good dress, ordered big size according to review, but was a bit large im a 14, good quality"
4.0,"Fine for the price and I know my son will love them, but would have been nice if they included earring stops.  You really need them for fish hook earrings."
4.0,"I ordered a size up, as instructed. Usually wear a medium and ordered a large. A tiny bit loose. Good enough for a costume. Perfect for Steampunk fun."
4.0,Loved the pendant and customer service. The presentation box was poorly constructed and looked hand made
4.0,Nice shirt. Tight in the underarms. Buy a size larger than usual. Overall a nice shirt.
4.0,"I bought this purse for my wife.  She loves it.  The color and craftsmanship is outstanding.  I'd give it 5 stars but she made a suggestion that, while keeping the buckle appearance, it would be better if there was a magnetic snap to fasten the top flap instead of having to buckle every time.  Excellent quality."
4.0,"Nice, would've given 5 stars, but they are a bit on the large side... hard to keep them on if you move around a lot."
4.0,"Great shirt, nice color and very soft. I needed to size up."
4.0,"I'm 5'5&#34; about 220 lbs and fit me fine. The elastic waist is not strong though - I had to keep hiking them up all night. The legs fit, but it was the waist line that was annoying. Still a good buy for 80's night!"
4.0,Im really happy with it. I wish it had s little more shape to it but it definitely does the job.
4.0,I gave these as gifts and they loved the earrings.
4.0,"They are cute, not as big as I thought"
4.0,"I bought this in a bigger size because a lot of amazon items run small, but this is very Foley and forgiving. I was expecting it to be a little longer, but if worn with shorts it made it look like I had no bottoms on. I would buy again and get my normal size. Do not size up. Straps are adjustable which is great too."
4.0,"The shirt just looks a little different in then in the picture, My wife likes my shirt tight on me, it does fit snug but comfortable"
4.0,"Love it over all, however the bottom is a bit thin. True to size. But if u r looking for a pair of shoes also for long walks, these might be a bit hard"
4.0,"Beautiful, but one arrived broken--the gem was out of the stud. We were able to fix it...so far..."
4.0,"really nice, flattering fit... the color was more red than the picture suggests, but the fit is great. I'll probably order some other colors as well."
4.0,"These little strips really came in handy for my family this weekend and I think parts of the rest of this week.<br /><br />I live in the Portland Oregon area and we are experirncing a terrible ""Super Massive"" Smoke Event.  Since we don't have respirators we used this strips with resusable cloth masks and insertable filters to get our mail, meet the grocery delivery person and take out garbage out.<br /><br />The strips are easy to use and I think they really helped keep some of the toxic smoke out of our mouths and noses.<br /><br />My one complaint is that they are not very wide and because of the thickness of our resusable cloth face masks there isn't very much leeway when you line them up along the edges of your mask and onto your skin.<br /><br />Something else you should be aware of is to not use this on skin that has been recently moisturized.  My skin is super duper dry so the stickers were solid on my face but my husbands nose was kinda greasy since he had taken a shower a few hours previous and I think if it hadn't turned cool and he'd begun to perspire the sticker would have popped right off like a ball on a water slide.<br /><br />So about skin irritation; I didn't have any and I wore this for almost 40 minutes.  I have such dry skin that I use Eucerin on my face and it didn't even leave any marks, so it is super gentle.<br /><br />I tried using these with my glasses and they didn't fog up but I had to double some of the stickers to stop my breath from escaping the mask.<br /><br />Cost - Obviously buying a fitted mask would be more cost effective if you have to wear a mask to work or for anything more than an hour here and there.  But these are pretty great for the interim."
4.0,"Bought this hoodie for my friend, and she loves it."
4.0,"it works like a charm to unscrew the back of a watch without scratching it.  However, it is hard to store.  Thus 4 stars."
4.0,Very comfortable! REALLY would like a pair in black!! What I don’t like is how difficult it is to close all 3 of the eye & hook closures at same time.
4.0,Seem to hold up well.
4.0,"It just arrived today early I'm happy about that. It looks just as it is being advertised, my son likes it a lot . I just hope the material can live through mash washings. The tag says machine wash"
4.0,useful for light winter; not any less elegant.
4.0,"I bought these because my 3 month old loves to suck on burp cloths and I wanted them to be organic. I'm also going to use them as a security blanket etc. If we lose one, I will have some backups. Stitching is very secure on tags and label. So far washed them a few times and look new. They are a very pale pink."
4.0,Like but watch band was cheap.
4.0,I love muk luk cabin socks. I do buy a size up because I think they run small. I dropped a star because you won't get more than one winter of wear out of them before you get a hole in the heel. They do keep your feet toasty and are very comfortable. I wear an 8.5 shoe and I prefer the XL size.
4.0,This dress is about 2 sizes smaller than you original size
4.0,"Pricey, but versatile."
4.0,"True to size, fits very nice. material isn’t thick and a little see through"
4.0,"The cups are very stretchy and seem big. I tightened straps to bring cups up a little which made straps tighter on my shoulders and uncomfortable after a whole day of wearing. I think it would be better if the straps were thicker or re-enforced with a gel pad, then it would have been a good fit."
4.0,"The large should have fit my chest as I am within the parameters of that size, but I can't button the jacket.  Still, it is fine unbuttoned, with a scarf and shirt and I bought another one after trying the first.  I am petite and the jacket fit length, shoulders and sleeves so I didn't want to risk a size up just so I can button it.  The color is nice.  The fabric is a very light synthetic, it came slightly wrinkled and is staying that way.  I will have to try a light iron."
4.0,The set is super adorable and fit as expected. The quality is a little on the cheaper side but not so much so that i dont mind keeping it. Its a super comfy set and the tie dye pattern is super adorable
4.0,"I needed a prom-like dress for a party but I didn’t want to spend a lot of money, so I got this in red. I’m 5’3” and 150 lbs and I got a medium. It is very pretty and flattering on, but my only complaint is that the neckline is so low that all of my bras showed. I’m not small enough to go braless so I just wore a nude bra and dealt with it. Overall it’s a nice dress especially if you need a gown and don’t want to spend a lot!"
4.0,"Mom did stitch a stitch or two for a ‘smaller’ head, looks cute tho, lightweight instead of a wig for any high temp states! 😁"
4.0,I absolutely LOVE that this has pockets!
4.0,"This skirt is amazing in theory, I love the material and that it's lined. However, there is NO stretch, some women don't need the stretch, but sitting and standing I definitely need the stretch."
4.0,"Really good for the money.  Just the right length, and adds a nice layer of warmth without being bulky.  The only problem I have with it is that the neckline comes up a tad too high, and you can't fold it down, so depending on what I'm wearing it over, that part can get a little uncomfortable."
4.0,I got this to add to a charm bracelet. I was looking for a design with tulips in honor of my older sister. The purse design  was different than just another flower charm. It serves it's purpose. Like looking at the choices Goldia provides. I will order another charm from them when ready to add my bracelet.
4.0,"They look great, but I ended up giving them to my dad because the tint would give me a headache after while."
4.0,Makes a lot of noise when walking
4.0,they just are a shade darker of a pink that shown in the picture. work great but didnt end up becoming my new favorite pair liked I had hoped.
4.0,Pretty nice for the price. They feel light so kinda cheap feel. The lenses aren’t that dark but they seem to be polarized.
4.0,Should have an option to purchase a tool to take off and on links. For me this product was huge on my wrist and I needed to take off pretty much every link I could in order to use the product.<br /><br />Please note that Fitbit ability to change bands is a quite difficult method. Without hand strength this isn’t possible!
4.0,i love it its amazing would prefer if it was a bag that you can hold on shoulders to ( with an extra holder)
4.0,"It was a little bit large in the bust even though measurements were provided.  Other than that, a great buy!"
4.0,Most comfortable pair of shorts. Little roomy
4.0,"Runs a little small.  I am usually a size small, but a  medium is just about right. I’d recommend sizing up. Wash on gentle and air dry, fabric seems a little easy to get roughed up.  Still a good buy for the price and style."
4.0,Pleasantly surprised by heft and quality
4.0,"I am a 36DD before pregnancy. I bought a two pack of this bra that fit much better than this 3 pack. 3 pack provides no support AT ALL for anyone with large breasts. The padding is nice and they are pretty comfortable. Would not buy again. As soon as I got these, the 2 I'd bought a few month prior started to unravel where the arm bands meet the cup. I've had to reinforce the fabrics together on the pad inserts but with the price as it is, much of this was expected, which is why I give this purchase 4 stars and not 2."
4.0,"My daughter loved this dress and it looked good on her.  I would have given it 5 stars, however the flower was only pinned on and the back of the pin ripped off making it useless only an hour into the holiday party."
4.0,I should have order a size up around my breast however my purpose in aqua therapy is to lose weight ... 10 lbs and it will fit just right!
4.0,"Nice shades!! My only issue is the part that goes behind the ear is very thick and bulky, a little uncomfortable so they're not very light weight. Otherwise the little skulls are so cute and they definitely do their job protecting my eyes from the sun!!"
4.0,"I love this dress! It fits as expected, but is still a little snug. I am 5’7” and 180lbs, three weeks postpartum. I thought where the skirt and top cake together would be a little more flowy but it clings just a tad. Still a pretty dress for and awesome price!"
4.0,"Kinda snug in the body, but overall great for! Everyone loved the dress."
4.0,"Only reason for 4 stars is haven't worn yet. Exactly as shown. Remember, these are quite small."
4.0,Tight in the shoulders but large everywhere else.
4.0,Beautiful dress but too long and heavy. I am 5 5&#34; and 140lbs. ordered a small. fit fine but not lengthwise
4.0,Good for the price! Great starter for our son. I like that belt was included. Dont dry it tho!
4.0,I am 4'11 and it is a little bit long. It goes past my knees. The torso part is really big too but the fabric is great and looks extremely cute. I just told the midline up and wear a belt with it to hike it up more and not have such a long torso in it.
4.0,Pajamas were very nice quality and fit well. My husband liked them and that is all that counts.
4.0,"It's a nice dress but if you have a larger bust, the buttons in the front will be bursting to some extent. I think ordering a size up would make the rest of the dress too big :-/  If you wear a dark bra, no one will notice."
4.0,I used these for a 70.3 and they worked well.  A little tight in the legs and I'm 6' 170.  Nothing uncomfortable but the seams are snug.
4.0,"Very cute & comfy, the checkerboard stripes on the sleeve are a little thicker than they seem but definitely a cute cropped hoodie!"
4.0,Perfect fit.  The Color is running.  It was a good thing I washed seperately.  I wore it the first time today and the color was still running.  My hand is all blue right now.
4.0,I love the fabric and the shape. I deducted a star because of the size. They run very small in the waist. I ordered a size up and probably should have ordered two sizes up.
4.0,"I like this necklace. It's expensive looking with a little bit of ""weight"" to it."
4.0,"Ran just a bit big, but not hugely so."
4.0,"Bought this for when my husband came home from Saudi Arabia. It was cute, but not well made and a little small."
4.0,Love my mask!!!! Fits perfectly is soft it’s really hard to breath through tho and mine did not come with the inserts. Came way early was due end of June but came a month earlier o was so excited!!! Was like a kid on Christmas morning!!!!
4.0,"Flowers are a bit of a different print, and little loose, but cute!"
4.0,All arrived promptly and is a good value
4.0,"REALLY LOVE the winter version of this and wear the ones I have almost all winter. Bought this in the winter. Since it's thinner, I haven't tried it yet but love Nike products so know I'll wear a lot, too."
4.0,Very nicely made belt. Comes packaged quite well also.
4.0,These bottoms are cute but are a little too full cut for me.
4.0,"I love them, they are great for everyday casual wear!"
4.0,"Good watch, exactly what I wanted, I like the size of it. I tried to install a NATO band but couldn't actually get the spring bars out-- neither pushing in the direction of the arrows, nor compressing the spring worked.<br />UPDATE: finally got the band on, never did get the springs out.. wish they were easier to remove."
4.0,It was a little small but looked as advertised.
4.0,Very good size and beautiful pendent. But clasp of the chain is so small difficult use.
4.0,"Love to look and the subtle energy of this stone combination, but the flat beads do pinch now and then, and I have to wear this on top of long sleeves to avoid the pinching. I’m looking into buying the same beautiful stone combo, but with round beads instead, as those are always comfortable to wear."
4.0,Wife absolutely loved it and it fit perfect
4.0,"I live in New Jersey where the winter is very harsh this new year-2022. (01/11/22 - 9' degrees) My new coat came right on time! No icy wind or snow has penetrated. The only downfall I found is that it only has two pockets. I would love the company to add a semi-deep pocket above the chest area for easy access to wallet or id, w/a zipper."
4.0,"The wallet is beautiful; nice leather, slim design, enough pockets....<br />... but the pockets are a wee bit too narrow. I have difficulty inserting<br />a standard credit card or drivers' license.<br />Two millimeters would do it .<br />HERBY"
4.0,"This Gemspire Crystal set is a decent set of gemstones. I got them for my son who is really into gemstones and rocks, and had previously been asking for a necklace with a gemstone on it. So this kit seamed perfect for my needs!<br /><br />The gems themselves all seam to be doing ok. They are definitely not as nice and round and polished like the photos on the Amazon page suggest, but you do get all that’s promised. The little hook that is on a few of the gems so that you can wear them as a necklace are not the best quality. One was broken on arrival and the other didn’t last the week. So if your getting them for that reason I would definitely pass. But other than that it’s a cute set of an assortment of gems!"
4.0,"I don't know if I will use this as a swimsuit coverup--it wasn't available in the color I wanted in time for my vacation--but I decided to order it in another color and try it out anyway.  I love it!  It is loose, light and airy. It feels like it would be very cool.  I am a size 22 on top and a 24 on bottom, so I ordered the 3X and it fits.  I was worried it would be too wide on top and fall off my shoulders, but it does not.  The polyester material is extremely thin, but the blue-and-white print that I ordered is opaque.  The V neck does plunge quite a bit, so a regular bra would show underneath.  I am a shortwaisted 5'6"" and it hits me about 3"" above my knee.  The only thing I don't like about it is that the sleeves are not hemmed, they are cuffed, and the cuffs show the underside of the printed fabric.  I am taking away one star for that reason only.  I might just take it on my vacation as a tunic or dress, because it will be very comfortable and compact to pack."
4.0,"Awsome, just a little hole in the leg, just check very well when amazon deliver the package"
4.0,"I used these unitards for a dance routine and they did the job! The quality was very good.  The material is slightly thinner than the BalTogs unitards, but otherwise comparable to BalTogs.  I usually order XL, but I ordered these in a L and it fit like a glove and it sucked everything in."
4.0,Great little boot
4.0,Grandson loves it. Great fit.
4.0,"This is a really gorgeous necklace.  The picture and description doesn't do it justice.  The only drawback is the chain is kind of short.  However, I used a necklace extender to wear the necklace, especially when I wear turtleneck sweaters which brings out the ""bling"" of these necklace.  I've gotten a lot of compliments on this necklace."
4.0,Not as well put together as the original from 20 years ago (or more)!
4.0,Arrived quickly in the mail!! These sunglasses are comfortable and work great.  Love them!
4.0,"I like the way the toe end of the shoe is closed up. My toes aren't pretty and so when I did wear sandals I'd wear socks. I don't have to wear socks with these. They're a little large, but very comfortable."
4.0,"Love the quality of Raen sunglasses, they fit my big head it is just i am get used to wear thicker frames. Good protection from the sun and stylish look."
4.0,These are very cute and would make cute Easter egg or stocking stuffers! One pair in our set was a little off around the top but not so much I want to send it back.
4.0,I used this wig at Halloween when I dressed as the girl from the ring. It held up great all day long. It fit snug enough for me to be running around scaring people but not so snug that it gave me a headache. It was a little stringy and got really tangled by the end of the day. That was perfect for me though since I was using it for a scary costume.
4.0,Really good looking build I'm now convinced this is real leather so I'm going through hold back my one star
4.0,This hat has been a life saver. I has severe light sensitivity and sunglasses just don't cut it. This is super light and the bendable edge is perfect in the car so I can postion the shade so I can still see the scenery.
4.0,"These tank tops are bright colors and will be cute as tank tops. I was looking for compression tops to help with my expanding menopausal mid-section. I tried to follow the size chart and reviews to get the right fit.  Item was stated as 15% spandex so I thought I was ok.  I got the XL and it is no where near a compression type tank for me.  I am 5'3 about 160lb and a 36DDD. The bust fits ok, but too loose below to hold anything in."
4.0,I was looking for some thing for compression but not too much so I could sleep at night holding as everyone says the triple D girls in place. It is perfect for that but not some thing that I would wear being a larger person in public or working out. Would use to wear to work out in my own home. Compression is enough to sleep not compression enough to work out. It fit my needs.
4.0,":) These easily fit around my big head. They're a little stiffer than an older bandana I've got but hopefully they'll soften with wear.<br /><br />:(  The print design is only on one side, and on my package, the mailing label overlapped the package opening in a way that prevents me from using the package to return the bandanas if I wanted to."
4.0,"So far so good!  I put these in my daughters Addidas superstar shoes and she loves how easy they are to put on and take off.  She says they fit a little loose, but I noticed her old laces were pretty tightly pulled.  I mention this because I know other reviewers said they were too tight.  Anyway, we’ll see how well they hold up.  It is a beautifully simple product, but honestly I think the price is on high side.  I bought one to try before buying more, to see if they are worth it.  I know I would have bought at least 3 pair already if they were cheaper."
4.0,"very nice......could be a bit cooler, but all and all a great buy."
4.0,"Colors are nice, material is soft/silky. It's a bit tight & I have a small head"
4.0,This was beautiful. I got compliments all night.
4.0,Very comfortable and light feeling
4.0,"Pros: Machine wash and dry. Buttery smooth. No runs! Dye keeps its vibrancy and color. Cute casual comfortable design for lounging, but also sexy and inviting for snuggling ;) I've received compliments on how nice these PJs are.<br /><br />Cons: Though it is a thinner, sheerer fabric, it is not as breezy and breathable as I'd like. I've woken up hot and slightly dewy in these. Pits tend to absorb body odor instead of masking it.<br /><br />Overall, the pros outweigh the cons and I'm very happy with these PJs!<br /><br />**If this review was helpful, please click below!**"
4.0,"This item is a little thin, however, my 7-year girl loves it."
4.0,"I have had this bag for a bit now and will say I really like it! Some of the previous reviews I've read said that the front button basically holding the bag together broke. As I've used it quite a bit I can see how that may happen when carrying larger heavier items. This bag has been good as my work bag. I carry it instead of my purse so I can bring snacks, my lunch, a book etc. to work and haven't had an issue with it breaking. It's quite comfortable and I have had many compliments on it."
4.0,"These are cute and comfortable, for a very short of time. They rub on the top of my foot, so I can only wear them for a few minutes at a time, but they are great for taking the dog out for a quick trip, or around the house. htey give waaaaaaaaay more arch support than flip-flops."
4.0,"I love them, fit a little loose and heel is a little higher than i wanted but very nice boots!"
4.0,excelent cotton like always with Carters but i buy 2 pack size 2/3 and 2 pack 4/5 and 1 do not was in stock
4.0,"I received this product at a reduced price in exchange for my fair and honest opinion. Im glad I read the previous reviews and ordered a size up. It does run about a size to a size and a half small, but is still super comfortable to wear, although I haven't worn it for an extended period of time yet.  I did notice a huge difference in my silhouette when i put in under neath my clothes.  Anxious to wear it for an extended time, I do like the adjustments on it as well and the fact its not super bulky.  Definitely worth the buy!"
4.0,Great for your tee ball player. Keeps the sun out.
4.0,"Great watch and all but you can't take the links out or add any yourself, you have to take them to a jeweler and get it done."
4.0,Nicely machined
4.0,product works well.
4.0,"These have super soft fabric, and are comfy, but in my regular size (small-5’7’’, 135lb, athletic) as soon as I twisted it flexed anything, the fabric puckered at a seam on the rear from the pocket-super weird! I’m going to try and return for a smaller size to see if that helps. **update I changed from 2 stars to 4-the smaller size (xs) helped the puckering! I posted the photos of the new pair-keeping them!"
4.0,"I like the glasses. I get a lot of compliments on them. I got these pair so I wouldn’t ruin my good ones. I’m wearing these more than my expensive ones. Just flimsy, as to be expected because of the price"
4.0,"This dress was beautiful! I got compliments all night. However, it did rip in the armpits, guess I was partying too hard!"
4.0,"Really cute, ordered a size up, still a little snug but not terrible. Long enough to wear heels with"
4.0,Got this for my wife who loves the print. The material is a thick spandex feel to it though. She referred to it as a full-body bathing suit lol. She is very happy with it though
4.0,Seems a little expensive for the quality
4.0,They are ok...
4.0,"This item is different than I expected, as the pearls move along the leather piece.  Sometimes the pearls bunch.  Other than that, it is a wonderful product, which I like."
4.0,Pricy but was good quality and my grandson loved it
4.0,"Quality Item and ideal warmth for 0 to 40 degree weather. Satisfied with purchase. However, the coat is a bit rigid and the size runs from 1/4 to 1/2 size small. (Mainly in the shoulders)"
4.0,"Very cute dress, fit a little odd, but still fit. I'm 5'9 and 130 lbs."
4.0,This shirt did fit as expected but the only complaint I have is I felt the sleeves were a bit short
4.0,Size was suprising
4.0,"Really cute fit, not the highest quality material but you get what you paid for. I am 5”4 127 pounds and purchased a S, it is a little roomy, but the back ties so you can adjust as needed"
4.0,Beautiful material color was really pretty
4.0,"Loved the color and the design, the quality is good too. I gave it four stars because it looked just ok on me. It was a little loose on my 140 pound figure, and I didn't fill out the top (32B) I ordered a small. I think someone with bigger boobs might fill out the dress better"
4.0,"The dress is beautiful, it did not include the tiara (this is a separate purchase)."
4.0,Very good wig! It's the perfect color! The only reason it is four stars is because I had to cut the bangs myself.
4.0,"They look great and fit great, my wife was surprised, she really likes them."
4.0,"Very cute dress but sleeves are very long not like the photo, but rolled up its cute. On the fence about keeping."
4.0,I liked them anyway.
4.0,"I ordered the dark pink one, size Medium. I'm 5'5&#34; and just under 130 pounds with a more &#34;boxy&#34; figure. I typically wear a size 2 and XS when buying clothes, but after reading a lot of reviews I just went for the Medium to make sure I liked it ok! I love the fit and the length is maybe 4&#34; above my knee, which is perfect to wear to work or a bridal shower (which was what I bought it for!). The pink is more vibrant in person, and it is a very &#34;girly&#34; dress -- I felt a little like a housewife in it...not my style, but it's a very cute dress! I feel like I could have fit fine in the Small, but the fit, material, and overall style of the dress is more flattering in a &#34;loose&#34; style (if that makes sense..). Definitely worth the $12!!!"
4.0,"Very pretty, great for a beach cover-up or going out."
4.0,Images were clear and just like the photo.<br />The metal clips are rather cheap and will likely break if not taken care of but that pretty standard for these things.<br />Overall very happy with the purchase.<br />I’ve had a few people comment about it when they see the lanyard around my neck or hanging from my pocket.
4.0,Cool and comfortable and very cute. My only complaint is that it wrinkles up very easy.
4.0,Some of the masks didn't stay in place.  But overall they were a hit at the party.
4.0,Excellent condition and never came off while I've used them so far. With the curved lenses I did notice that it can get a little fuzzy at times when swimming under water but things come into focus when u slow down back down. Flat lenses may be better for keeping things in focus but it didn't bother me enough to want to send them back and get some other ones.
4.0,"I received the wrong color leggings to begin with. I ordered the charcoal color and got the teal color instead. However, I liked the way the leggings fit so I decided to keep them. After about 3 washes, the seams have started to come apart and there’s a hole in the seam. Very disappointed in the poor quality of these leggings. I was shipped another pair, in the correct color, they fit well and have held up well thus far."
4.0,They do the job. Don't expect much.<br />I wish the lenses would darken and faster.<br />But they do come with a case. Overall pretty good for the price.
4.0,Heel is too shallow
4.0,Dress is okay. Fits true to size. Will be a decent casual dress for the summer. I did not notice the chest pocket in the listing pictures so beware of that. It sits high so it’s on top of my chest making it useless even if I wanted to carry things in my dress.
4.0,"When I first received the dress it was perfect but after a few washes and drying the threads started showing through the dress.  The only tag I found was showing the brand of the dress and size.  I think as long as you don't dry the dress it may last longer but I'm not really sure if it's the washing or drying causing the threads to show.<br /><br />Bought the dress because I liked the style.  Dress looks just like the photo.  Wore the dress to clean house in but can also be dressed up with heals.<br />Bought size S - dress fit perfect<br />My size - 32 bust, 26 waist, 32 hips"
4.0,"This is soooo cute. I love the color, style and fabric. I have a 39 waist and the 3X fit slightly small in the waist. But it fits otherwise very well...in the hips and length. I got the American flag style and can't wait for some patriotic festivities to wear this one. LOL."
4.0,"I love the dress, but I ordered it to be closed back after discussing it with the company and it came to me with an open back. Other than that the length and size is perfect and can not wait to wear it for my reception. Also it is extremely lightweight"
4.0,Our son (2) really wanted sunglasses. These have been durable but are a bit big. We had a strap that fit in the holes so that has helped secure them. Wish they came with a strap of some kind though so we didn’t have to move it between pairs in the various cars and home.
4.0,Very comfortable. Was concerned it would not breath but no problem in 98degrees. 5'3&#34; 120# a little long and loose
4.0,"These gloves come in XXL, which is not common in all gloves, so that's great. They are quite warm, but I think the materials are a little poor quality for the price (they look as though they will wear out quickly), which is why I removed a star. Overall, still decent gloves."
4.0,I don’t consider myself to have the perkiest of boobs but as a 5’3’ 140lb woman in my 30s I can confidently say the fit of this dress is complementary enough that I do not feel the need to hoist my boobs into a strapless bra.
4.0,"This dress is great and can be worn for so many different types of occasions. I instantly feel pretty when wearing it. It’s a tad big, especially in the chest area. I will probably have to put a stitch it at the top to help make sure it stays closed. Hem hits right above mid knee. I’m 5’ and 135 lbs with a small chest. I did try the medium and it was way too big."
4.0,"Purchased for my teenage daughter, we're overseas and find it difficult to purchase clip on earrings for her locally. These hoop ear rings give her the style and pierced look that she loves."
4.0,I love it but iy's bigger than what i expect . I more on like a pouch
4.0,Just fine and masculine.
4.0,Great dress.  It's not as thick as some of the others made by this brand but it will still make a nice fall dress.
4.0,"This is a fun FMA watch duplicate. I bought this as a gift. The quality of the necklace and ring leave something to be desired but the watch itself is a pretty good duplicate. The necklace is definitely some kind of cheaply die cast metal. The cost of this set was quite cheap, si I can't really complain that much."
4.0,"Es muy lindo. Tiene buen material, es suave y fresca y puedes usarlo en el gym sin problema... si tienes busto grande compra una talla más grande"
4.0,"Would've given 5 stars but the letters look a bit ""plastic-y"" and not really part of the shirt if that makes sense.  But it still makes me giggle every time I wear it! :)"
4.0,"The chain is really great. My boyfriend loves it. The only thing wrong with the chain is that the paint is coming off a bit but other than that, its pretty strong. I don't think it should break like the other necklaces I got him."
4.0,My husband loved how comfortable these pants were.
4.0,"When I opened the box, I couldn’t believe how huge these boots looked. I wear an 8, but these look more like a 9 or 9 1/2, which is weird because they actually fit well. They are easily an inch longer than any of my other shoes/boots. That being said, they are very comfortable and I ended up keeping them for yard work."
4.0,"These did not fit as expected. They were very short. The waist was acceptable, and of course the legs were roomy, but the length was not as described-- it was several inches shorter. These are very thin, really only acceptable for around the house or wearing over swim trunks on the beach. They are comfortable, though they tend to end up looking really wrinkled after running through the washing machine and dryer. Let's just say I wouldn't wear these on a dinner date or even on a trip to the grocery store. Four stars."
4.0,The material is a bit see through but nothing a slip couldn’t fix. This is a very classy skirt and can be paired with many different colors which is what I loved most about it. Quick delivery and no complaints besides the material being a bit thin.
4.0,These shorts are very comfortable. They are true to size. I wear a large therefore I purchased a large. I weigh 178 lbs. However; there is no tummy control in the animal print and no pockets.
4.0,"Good looking bag, but the opening is too small for me.  I have not used it and will probably get rid of it."
4.0,"Good pants, first came defective, thanks Amazon I got the second pair perfect. This pants a bit warm for indoor, ok now during winter."
4.0,Much nicer than expected given the price. Color exactly as pictured
4.0,Outfit was nice
4.0,The sunglass strap arrived quickly but I did have trouble fitting it on the glasses...However a couple of days later I received a very nice letter from the owner with a PDF file explaining how to  attach/insert the strap. Perhaps the instruction sheet could have been included in the package?
4.0,"These Clip-Ons did not come with Hard White Plastic case as pictured.  They came with a flexible clear plastic case. So, 1-Star deducted for false advertising.  Otherwise they seem nice.  Time will tell.  I also purchased the Tacloft Unisex Rectangle 57mm Polarized Clip on Sunglasses CLIPON2015.  They did come with the correctly pictured case."
4.0,Bought these for my husband to wear to work around he house and shop during the hot summer months. They fit beautifully and are very comfortable. Don't know yet how they will wash but if they pass that test we will be ordering more.
4.0,My dog loved them better than I!
4.0,"Fit is good, but for me it could of been a tad bit tighter."
4.0,For the price that you get for these I expected cheap so it was no surprise when Each bracelet broke after only second day of wearing them.
4.0,"This dress quality is on the cheaper side, but when worn correctly it can look fabulous in my opinion. The yellow was bright & fun!  A slip may help some feel more comfortable, but it wasn’t a must for me.  Medium fit perfect on me. Medium is my go to size as well."
4.0,exactly as described. they get the job done and great packing!
4.0,"Ordered XL, I am male, 6’1” and 178lbs<br /><br />Pros<br />- came 10 days earlier than estimated<br />- good material, feels comfortable<br />- not cheaply put together<br />- good colors and graphics<br />- fits as expected<br />- accurate recreation<br /><br />Cons<br />- arms a little tight around elbows<br />- loose threads, but easily cut off with tweezers<br />- small hood<br />- small random spot of red, assuming it’s a mistake when putting on graphics"
4.0,"This is a warm thermal set.  I ordered up one size and it fits snug  but comfortable.  The pants fit like leggings and go past my ankle and the waist is high so my backside and belly stay covered.  The shirt has long arms - which I like and need.  It's long enough to go past the waist and doesn't ride up.  But, the neckline is so scooped that all of my neck and  most of my chest is exposed and it makes me feel cold.  It gaps weird in the shoulder area, creating a loose area at the bottom of the neckline.  I just don't understand all of the effort to make the clothing keep you warm and then allow the neck and chest area to be uncovered.  I'm going to look for a top that has a normal neckline.  I haven't washed it yet so I don't know if it will stay the same shape.  I hope it doesn't shrink.  If it does, I won't be able to wear it.<br />UPDATE:  I have worn the pants daily since I bought them.  They continued to fit perfectly and keep me warm.  Washed in the washer on hand wash and hung to dry.  EXCEPT, the last time they got washed they were put in the dryer accidentally.  They didn't shrink BUT they are noticeably thinner and don't keep me as warm anymore. I am so bummed.  Be sure to keep them out of the dryer as stated on the label."
4.0,Liked the shirt just run small.
4.0,"I like the looks of this silver bracelet, but the quality and weight was not what I was expecting, was hoping for something heavier and more genuine for the price."
4.0,The size descriptions is not right.<br />Buy two size up
4.0,"Really like the lenses.  They were not EASY to get into the frame, but they do feel secure when finally clicked in.  I did show my wife how they can bend out of the frame without breaking (as shown in the installation video from Revant) and this caused a bit of the color to disappear from the middle of the lens (where it bent directly above the nose).<br /><br />Other than that - so far so good and I'm thrilled to have an affordable option for replacing the Oakley lenses.<br /><br />***EDITED on 10/22/15 to ADD***<br /><br />Received email from Revant offering to replace lenses due to defect after leaving my review.  I appreciate and took them up on the offer although I do not recommend demonstrating the bending ability on your new pair, no matter if they're supposed to be able to withstand it or not. ;)<br /><br />Thanks Revant!  Added a star for great customer service!"
4.0,"my daughter-in-law loved them and she is wearing them a lot,"
4.0,"Fits fine, nice color, but was NOT expecting the rainbow design.. I thought it was silver or a gold.. the side and extra length on one half didn't look as good as I had imagined it too.."
4.0,they run a little small
4.0,"Bought for a wedding.  Loved the color, blue, and the overall flow and look of it, lots of compliments.  However, the top was a bit too tight for comfort and had to have it altered.  The pants were a lovely fit, just needed to be taken up a bit, as expected as I'm rather short.  The jacket was perfect.  Shipping takes quite a long time, so order months in advance!"
4.0,"It's a nice bag, but quite stiff.  Handles that were bent in shipping do not easily straighten.  Color is much more silver than gray.  Picture is a bit deceiving."
4.0,I thought the valves would help vent and prevent my goggles from fogging but alas they still fogged... If you’re doing anything besides a sport where goggle dog is an issue then this is great!
4.0,"The clutch lock kept unlocking. Was not able to keep it closed. At one point, all my belongings were on the floor. Very pretty and stylish purse; but not practical (or reliable);<br />However, the seller was understanding and replaced the clutch for me.<br />Love this purse. It’s very elegant."
4.0,"Very soft, loose and comfortable, but modest. I have washed it once, and seems to be just as soft as new."
4.0,"Cute, but much too small. Returned"
4.0,"These leg warmers look very cute on. I have been wearing them all winter and so far they have held up well. My only complaint is that they do stretch out a little. I have been careful to not pull on them too much but they have become a little loose. They have started to slip down a little on my leg. However, they still look cute."
4.0,I bought this in large and it was way too big so I bought it in medium and it fit much better. The only thing I don’t like is how big the neck is…which is why I dozed down because the neck seemed to fit better. I loved how it was loose and flowed. It was a nice comfy new dress and I got a lot of compliments with it!
4.0,"Great quality, but a little tight around the head. I get a headache when I use then for a long time"
4.0,"Great quality, cute colors but it was a crop top and I was looking for a typical length hoodie for my kiddos."
4.0,"Good overall. Material is Slightly on the thin side, but that will still make it useful in the spring I think."
4.0,I love my credit card holder. I've had two so far and are perfect for me. I just purchased three for gifts.
4.0,"They havent caused any sensitivity for me, and I have a hard time finding earrings I'm not allergic to. So that's great! But they're bigger than I'd thought and also not a shiny silver like I'd hoped for."
4.0,"We decided to pay a little extra to try and get a pair of shoes that lasted longer than a month. Our son is very active and he has been wearing out his shoes before he has a chance to grow out of them. These are a high quality shoe and my son loves them. My only complaint is that the strap doesn't easily loosen out all of the way (prevented by the velcro) which makes it difficult to get them on. His feet are on the big size but not giant. When purchasing them I wasn't sure whether to get the wide or the medium sizing (I purchased the medium) and perhaps the wide version would be easier to get on. Once his foot is in though, they seem to fit fine and are very supportive."
4.0,"The dress is cute, but I wish I had bought a size smaller. It also may look better on those with more height than myself. I am 5’3” and 110ish pounds.<br /><br />Pros:<br />My preteen told me it was the coolest dress I have ever owned.<br />Pockets!<br />Sash is not attached, so you could could skip it if you wanted.<br />I thought it was going to be sheer, but it’s not.<br />Seems well made. No stitching errors or flaws that I can see.<br /><br />Con:<br />I will probably shorten the back a bit.<br />Waist seems large, even with the elastic.<br /><br />Overall good dress and fun pattern!"
4.0,Great simple swim suit. Very happy.
4.0,Gorgeous dress for the price!!! Keep in mind you pay for what you get. Fits well. Material is a bit thin and shows every little bump and curve.
4.0,"If you normally wear L I would order XL.  They are very preet and comfortable and even fit OK, but not quite L as we know it to be."
4.0,I wear it for food service and it's lightweight and comfortable.
4.0,"not the best of quality, was coming off a little on the edges after a week. But decent band"
4.0,The bottom skirt part was not necessary and made the dress go all the way to mid knees. So I cut it off and the dress was perfect. Can wear alone or with black leggings.
4.0,Just fit right.
4.0,"I have received many compliments when wearing this dress.  The cut and fit are excellent.  The fabric weight is nice.  However, the pigment transfers to my skin and nearby surfaces.  Have laundered the dress on gentle cycle with woolite and hung to dry.  The pigment still transfers to my skin and nearby surfaces.  I have never seen anything like this."
4.0,"I got two of these as gifts for my sisters.  The burgundy looks dark brown and the red looks like an orangy-brown.  I'm disappointed in the colors.  But they don't seem like cheap bags, so they'll do."
4.0,Great tie. Easy to adjust. Slim and sleek
4.0,Very comfortable. Not too hot or cold
4.0,"Nice straw hat. The ears are holding up pretty well so far and our toddler is not gentle with her hats, so that’s good. Looks really cute on her. Just as pictured. Perfect for a trip to Disney."
4.0,"The blouse arrived in two days as I have Amazon Prime.  I'm 5'7&#34; and a busty 205 lbs and bought the XL. It fits perfectly with a plunging neckline and is long enough to wear with leggings.  I bought the blouse in red and plan to wear a black cami under it.  The material is thin, stretchy and comfortable and I can tell it will get a lot of use. After I wear it and wash it and see how it does, I may order another because it flatters my figure.  I gave it four stars instead of five because it arrived somewhat wrinkled.  I've hung it in the closet but if wrinkles don't fall out, I may have to wash it or at least wet it and hang to dry.  Overall, pleased with this purchase."
4.0,Good material I would go up 2 more size over all love it
4.0,"Great watch with beautiful design and texture, but it's not easy to replace the battery."
4.0,Good color and warm.
4.0,"Love the size and the weight.  Not too sure how well the zippers will hold up, but can’t beat the price.  I tend not to keep purses longer than a year or so so very satisfied with the purchase"
4.0,"I love it. Very simple, goes greats with almost everything, and affordable!"
4.0,"I like this watch well enough, but it doesn't do much to improve the time it keeps."
4.0,"this is the second one I bought , I have a stainless one I ware every day for work and I bought a gold one for weekends and going out<br />look great, work great, very light,well made,  can't beat the price"
4.0,Love these booties and get lots of compliments. Pretty hard some so not comfortable for a long time but beauty is pain right?
4.0,"These pants are ADORABLE, but I'm having to return them because they're too short. I'm almost 5'11&#34;, so it's always a gamble with pants for me, though."
4.0,This hat will pack in luggage well. Rolls up and has a band to wrap around it and keep it in place. I'd give it 5 stars but I'm waiting to see how well it hold up over the summer.
4.0,"Love the pattern and style!  As for the fit, I had to go up a size in this skort.  This was the first time that I had to go up a size in the approx. 6 Monterey Club skorts that I have purchased.  I wear these skorts to my Tai Chi Chuan classes, and it really helps with the kicks!"
4.0,Lot of necklace for such a small price.<br />If you love jewelry like I do this is great for bland tops or dresses to give it more pizazz🎇🎆
4.0,"The sorts are quite warm. They had a couple issues which the seller made contact with me right away. I work where ther is draft in the floor so I'm looking forward to the same warmth I felt wearing them on Christmas Day.<br />Update-I still love these socks, but they are for hand wash only."
4.0,I’m an adult but a tiny one. It fits good but not floppy. Stuff.
4.0,I really like these shirts for layering or casual. They have a nice cut. Seem to fit true to size or a little small. I have them in a few colors. Only problem is they really have an odd smell when you get them.
4.0,"I love this broach, look so expensive and nice on my uniform.  I will definitely recommend buying if you like it."
4.0,"There is nothing worse than buying a new pair of shoes (or cleaning a pair of oldies but goodies) only to somehow NOT be able to void mud or some other staining property when outdoors. I was so pleased to use this but need to make it very clear that you must clean your shoes completely before using this.<br /><br />Once you have totally cleaned your shoes, you apply this to them and it is amazing how well it deflects and allows for easy removal of pretty much anything that gets on them. I have not (obviously) tested staining materials on my shoes, but they do remain much more clean than they did prior to using this.<br /><br />Look forward to cleaning up some old shoes and trying this on them too. I will finally lose my mindset that I need to buy new shoes when my old ones get dirty. :)"
4.0,"Very pretty dress, just a bit too small."
4.0,color is nice，meterial is comfortable，very is thin，very cool，body size is good，arm size is a little tight
4.0,Beautiful ring! Gem is large and a definite eye catcher.
4.0,It is TRUE to size.  I bought this for my 13 year old son and he loves it.  It's not very thick.
4.0,"Good for a bout 50 miles, after that gets a little tight and warm"
4.0,Overall cute top and good value. Stylish and decent quality.
4.0,"Buying this made me learn how to tie a bow tie, but it looked amazing, but I just didn’t like how unsymmetrical it looked 😕"
4.0,I was very happy when I received them ! They are light weight and seem a little delicate but I still think it's a great buy for the price :)
4.0,Aceptable
4.0,I would have given it 5 stars but the earrings arrived without earring backs......
4.0,MATERIAL & COLOR GREAT
4.0,Very Nice Looking Watch w/x-large display. Mesh Band was somewhat Difficult to Set up and Use though and reason for returning 1 (gift) of 2 watches.
4.0,It works okay
4.0,Very Pretty. Wish it came in a box not a bag.
4.0,"This dress is only sized for girls with *girls*. I’m a 5’7, 180lbs, 36B but am also heavy in the mid section compares to how small my boobs are. The dress was very tight at my waist line and almost falling off my shoulders. If I had a D cup it probably would have fit just right. My friend safety pinned me in place so it looked alright. Good quality dress just odd proportions."
4.0,Nice coverup. I only wish it wasn't quite so low cut.
4.0,Product is pretty good but just make sure you properly rinse the soap off your shoes that are cloth material because it will stain. I recommend after you scrub with the soap follow up with a scrub of just plain water. Also don’t use it on suede. But over it’s a decent product.
4.0,Bought as a gift for my wife.  Fit as expected.  She liked the quality of the dress but the style did not match her taste.
4.0,"They are a little heavy, otherwise they are 5 stars"
4.0,"Fits great, beautiful colors, fits very snug in the bust line. But I Iove it anyways"
4.0,"got it for the aesthetic, it looks good but it can be very uncomfortable for long time use. it's a little tight around the mid section too."
4.0,"These are pretty excellent yoga pants for the price. Quality material, and it didn't attract a ton of dog hair like usual. The color was a bit off; I ordered the new olive, and they looked dark gray/black."
4.0,They are a bit large & long. But they are so comfy. I would order them again maybe in a smaller size
4.0,"I missed when ordering that the tablecloth, spoons and forks are just plain blue and not Octonauts themed.  The shade of blue at least matches the background of the Octonauts themed plates, cups and napkins."
4.0,It fell apart at the attachment to the heart lost the keychain heart is beautiful too bad I can’t use it as a keychain
4.0,"I had ordered the pirate Santa hoodie in size 2X, I normally wear a size large to maybe extra large. But I got the 2x knowing that it is not a fleece hoodie it's like a satin spandex kind of Hoodie. Also by reading the other review is that most of these sizes ran a little small that's why I got a bigger one. so now I can fit warmer shirts underneath it just fine."
4.0,"Love this sweater - looks so much better on than it does on the hanger.  be sure to try it on.  I'm 5'4 110 lbs, 24d, ordered a small and it fits great."
4.0,"This is a great product for the price! It was missing one ring holding two sections together, but I can fix that so I will keep it."
4.0,"Cute, just as show  in the ad.<br />Size is for a larger child (9-13 years old).  Too big for a child and a bit too small for an adult."
4.0,Comfortable! I got a few compliments.
4.0,"I have loved Vans since Jeff Spacolli.  These are Very cute and stylish!! Cool and tuff from a girls point of view, They can be worn with a skirt.  I hope they do mini mouse next."
4.0,"I loved this dress. The only reason for not 5 stars was that the fabric was slightly see through, but I wore a black undershirt underneath it. It is extremely flattering and the pockets are very low profile though!"
4.0,"These were a Christmas gift from my list, and they go well with my winter coat.  They are very warm, but they do run large.  Lovely details and I enjoy wearing them, I've had a number of compliments."
4.0,I liked them very much. Nice and comfortable.
4.0,The nosepiece was slightly different but it fit and the ear socks looked to small but they also fit. This is the old style M frame about 15 years old.
4.0,Platica así como lo esperaba
4.0,Great fit but a little thin compared to other brands but great for the price
4.0,"Glasses work great, easy to fold and unfold. Zippers on storage cases need improvement."
4.0,This umbrella seems to be good quality with Sunbrella material and a reliable mechanism for opening and closing.  The pole separates into two halves for easy storage. Not sure about the tilt feature since I have not used it much yet.
4.0,I love the pendant not that impressed with the chain but worth the money
4.0,"This is my second one.  Love this for many reasons; fit, snap closure, coverage, washes well.  Only problem is everything clings to it.  Tree catkins from a towel washed with wrap are embedded in the terry cloth & I've tried everything to remove them.  So glad Amazon provided my order history so I don't have to shop for one."
4.0,"This is a really flattering style, but don't believe the reviews that say it fits small; I am normally between a small and a medium but the medium was far too big on me and I exchanged it for a small, which fit perfectly (I am 5'3&#34;, 135 lbs, 34 x 28 x 38).  Also, the red is a truer red than it appears on my monitor, not pink at all.  Not really sure what the zipper is for; I didn't need to open it to get the dress on, it is very stretchy and forgiving.  I docked a star because the material doesn't breathe well so I can't wear it out on warmer days, but other than that it is a lovely little dress and worth what I paid for it."
4.0,"They're a bit small for me but then again, I have wide arms. Overall, they're pretty good quality for the price."
4.0,Runs big still very cute
4.0,I had no dislikes
4.0,Very good quality. Packaged like a boutique store! Pretty thick durable fabric...very cute. Plenty room cup size but a little tight around body...
4.0,Prefered the stone 1/4 size smaller!
4.0,Cool red cosplay glasses
4.0,"I was really happy to find one with RM and not Rap Monster. However, I think these might be Junior sized. I mean, that’s probably the issue when you’re 30 and you fall in love with a Korean boy band haha. Still, I ordered a 2XL and it fits like a Juniors L/maybe XL. Size up if you want a comfortable, roomier fit. This fits pretty close to the body."
4.0,"Very cute crop top.  Both sleeves and bottom hem are scalloped for a cute, youthful look.  The color heather gray is mostly gray in most light.  It will go well with white, shades of green, shades of blue, purple/lavender.<br /><br />The material is a blend that can be machine washed.  I would hang or towel dry away from direct sun.  This is very cute and sprightly."
4.0,"Very cute coverup.  Comfortable and fits as expected.  Be aware, it is swimsuit material, rather than cotton."
4.0,"This is a well-made bathrobe. It's lightweight, breathable, and comfortable. The material is soft and well sewn. I found no loose threads or seams. The stitching is straight. The waist sash isn't sewn on, it can be removed if needed. This bathrobe is designed to be used after you dry off, it's not super absorbant. I'm 5'6 and my husband 5'11. We found the length appropriate for both of us. It's true to size and fit as expected.<br /><br />Ratings (Out of five stars):<br />Material Quality: *4*<br />Stitch Quality: *5*<br />Comfort: *5*<br />Sise: *5*<br />Value: *3*<br /><br />Overall rating: 22 out of 25 stars / 4.4 Star Average<br /><br />SUMMARY: While I appreciate that most bathrobes are fairly expensive, I felt the $37.99 price tag was a little too high for this robe. This robe offers more luxury than functionality. For me, it limits the usability​ of it. If you need something to wear around a hotel, gym, or spa, then you might find more value in this than I did. That being said, it's very well made with no quality concerns. I would recommend it if it fit the needs of the purchaser.<br />__________________________________________________________<br /><br />I received this product complimentary from J.cotton for quality testing purposes.

4.0,I thought that it was for guys.
4.0,These swim goggles are just what I wanted. The seal prevents any water from entering and they are quite comfortable after they are adjusted properly.
4.0,Cozy and warm with the fleece inside are great for those cool mornings and evenings. I also like the non-slip buttons on the bottom. I will probably order the other colors as Christmas gifts.
4.0,I’m a medium but ordered a large.
4.0,The fit is expected. Runs a little big. But still Comfy and cute and the fabric is nice and soft.
4.0,Lovely belt but it is not as long as I espected
4.0,"Subtle black and grey design, fits snug over the lower half of my face.  A bit more breathable/cooler than thicker ones."
4.0,Adorable dress at a great price! Shipping cost was hefty.
4.0,"We used this to make my son’s assassin snow fox costume. It was great.  The mask fit great, was comfortable, and easy to wear. It was super cute and tied his costume together."
4.0,"I rated a 4 star because the suit was somewhat small. I usually wear a large/xl in tops and a small in bottoms and I ordered a 2X in this suit and the bottoms fit perfect and the cups were a little snug, but not too noticeable. I still love it and will continue wearing it! I've gotten so many compliments on it!! P.S. my cup size is 38DD and the 2X was snug in the cups..."
4.0,"they're very pretty- a little larger than I expected, but that's okay. I love them, but the earring backings they came with don't work with this pair of earrings. If you purchase, make sure you have a few extra earring backs."
4.0,"This is a cute necklace. It is very sturdy and doesn’t feel cheap. It is larger than I expected. I was hoping to wear it at work but it is too big and too long to wear for work. I do enjoy wearing it outside of work. I have worn it 5 or so times and it hasn’t worn out any, so I believe it is durable. I am happy with my purchase."
4.0,Good for any fan
4.0,Its a pretty necklace but the quality can improve.
4.0,Like the color and fabric. Does run a little small.
4.0,Once I opened them I couldn’t completely close them back but it is easy to hide that part. Otherwise very good jewelry.
4.0,The lever is hard to get through the belt material to fasten.
4.0,Looks authentic. Nice fabric.
4.0,"Super cute! It looks like it's great quality for the price I paid. I would recommend going up a size. I normally wear a 6, so I ordered a medium and it was too tight so I had to reorder a large."
4.0,"I picked these beaded earrings up because I need to add some variety to my earring style (I'm tired of wearing silver hoops every single day). They are really pretty! I love the turquoise against the gold tone. They are a great size, and also super lightweight and comfortable to wear. The one issue I had with them is they move around a lot throughout the day, and if you don't readjust them, they would fall right out. It would have been nice to have a clear, rubber earring backer to keep them in place. They are beautiful, though, so I'll definitely be wearing them often."
4.0,It was fast shipping and receiving product as expected
4.0,Product arrived quickly and is what I was looking for.
4.0,"Very comfortable soft material. Fits as expected. Ordered a large and have to deal with the length, but that is usually the case. The graphics are a bit blurry. I did not mind, but be aware. Mom loved it as her gift!"
4.0,I still love the charm!!!!! It's just small which takes away from the absolute amazing features of the Hogwarts Train.<br />Am giving it as a gift as well. The receiver doesnt mind that it is small.
4.0,This is a very good heavy leather belt.  The leather tooling looks like it was done by hand.  The only &#34;con&#34; is that the belt measures exactly the size ordered.  My suggestion is to order your waist size (the REAL measurements) and add two inches to receive the proper fit.
4.0,Will have to return. Quality is great though.
4.0,"A little to short for me to wear as a dress, but pulled up like a top with a pair of white jeans and its very cute."
4.0,"I love these overalls! I’m usually a 1x-2x (18ish), and I ordered an xxxl. This gave me the perfect baggy fit. They’re cute and comfortable. I washed them with cold water and dried them on low, and they washed well. Shrank maybe a tiny bit, not enough to affect the fit."
4.0,I tried several styles of these polarized night driving glasses for motorcycle riding and I like these the best. They’re heavier than the plastic ones and you can bend the sides to fit snug behind your ear. I also think the shake is pretty cool 👍🏼
4.0,"This product came late, but was well worth waiting for! It include 12 fabric designs to choose for different uses. Perfect as a neck gaiter or headwear!!!  Comfortable! Not too tight nor too loose!!!  It's perfect as grab and go face covers without the fuss of a mask!!"
4.0,Cute little night shirt and fast shipping but definitely consider sizing up as I'm sure mine will be to small for me after laundering.
4.0,Son muy cómodos.
4.0,Great gift was excited to give as a gift.
4.0,"love it.. clasp a bit cheap, but overall, good looking watch.."
4.0,"This outfit is SO cute! I ordered 1-2 years and my daughter is 17 months it was WAYY too large. She is in the 90th percentile for height and the pants are still too long on her. The plus is she will be able to grow into it and  last awhile. Would definitely recommend, it’s adorable!"
4.0,"Very pretty flowers, not sure if it’s real leather."
4.0,I would have given these a five-star easily because I love them and I can wear them but they are very small and tight. Great for very thin small boned women. I have not to be like that anymore. So they were very snug on but they are really beautiful colors and comfortable bras
4.0,Not as shiny as the picture but it is as advertised.  Good price.
4.0,The material is very sleek and I loved the way it hugged on me. I’m 5’2” and 190 pounds with 38Gs so I’m extremely curvy and it looked really nice one me. One thing that was an issue was my chest area would widen as the day went on. You are gonna have to put a pin in it if you don’t want it looked too sexy.
4.0,"Yes it’s super soft, yes durability and value were perfect. Just wish the dimensions were spot on. I have a Pro Max 11 and even with a thin case on it was a very tight fit."
4.0,Fits well and is of OK quality.
4.0,"Luv it very comfy, recommend going one size up just for comfort though."
4.0,"A well executed ring for stainless steel. It is difficult to achieve fine detail in this material, but this ring has done so. Sizing is true. The only negative is that the brim of the hat on the shank extends too far out (high relief), and with a downward angle - thus forming a possible hook or snag on loose weave material. But, for the price, and material choice, it is an excellent past master ring that will last many lifetimes. Shipping by the seller was prompt, with a speedy delivery.<br /><br />With some jewelry making skills and experience, l ground, filed, peened and polished the hat down to a flatter, smoother profile will little change to the original design. I also removed the black background for a bright, matte background with polished raised surfaces."
4.0,"Love the shirt. Fits true to size (I'm 5'3&#34;, 140lbs and ordered a medium). Get compliments on it often."
4.0,"Love Freya! I'm a 34F and was professionally fitted locally, sadly, the place I was introduced to Freya bras is now out of business. I now buy this product on Amazon and I am always happy with the product's quality and fit. I am not in love with the pattern...I think the color was what sold me but overall I will continue to shop Freya!"
4.0,Great costume. Runs a bit big but a great costume and we just cross crossed  the straps and it works perfect.
4.0,"This band does run big as the other reviews have mentioned, so you're left with a long extra flap, it never bothered me too much and it stayed down pretty well. The strap holder loop did just break after some intense use, but I will definitely be buying another one because the pattern was really pretty and the band was comfortable."
4.0,"rolls down from time to time, so, a bit annoying"
4.0,They are smaller than I had thought but they are still very nice.
4.0,[[VIDEOID:c87680985f999672b963ca8dd7f34885]] This shirt is so cute I love the added lace on the back.<br /><br />Likes:<br />*The material is thin so I paired a cami underneath.<br />*The stitching was done well with no lose threads or uneven hems.<br />*The shirt washed well and did not fade.<br /><br />Overall this is a great shirt I couldn't find any imperfections.<br /><br />I was selected to review this product at a discount in exchange for my honest opinion. My reviews are for the consumer and have not been manipulated or compensated in any way.
4.0,Overall it was good. I had some minor alterations done. It made all the difference.
4.0,Ordered a large.. I was skeptical at first because the outfit looks TINY .. but it does have major stretch. I’m 5’5 240lbs mostly butt and thighs ... it is tight on the arms but does loosen with wear .. will purchase again once I lose a few pounds !
4.0,"When I received these earrings ( the ""Bar"" design) I was super disappointed at how glarringly gold there were. To me, they looked cheap. But I really liked the unique design so I googled how to antique cheap gold. Being careful to not set myself or my house on fire, I used kitchen tongs to hold each earring over the open flame on my stove for a few seconds until the earrings took on an uneven and distressed coppery black color. Now they look awesome! I've received many compliments."
4.0,"Really like that it comes with multiple mask. Only thing is that it isn't as comfortable, the foam piece they put on isn't big enough and sits close to the eye"
4.0,"My daughter loved this dress.  We originally bought it for a Halloween costume and now she wears it all the time.  Super soft and comfortable, and fits as expected!"
4.0,"Fit well and is well made, but the brim is too flimsy and continually falls in front of my eyes.  I expect some &#34;floppiness&#34;, but this was a bit too much.  Perhaps a little ironing with starch would help. (?)  Otherwise, I like the hat and appreciate that it can be folded up and stuffed (more or less) in a pocket."
4.0,It’s a beautiful backpack and any mandalorian fan will love it!  It’s just a little awkward when hanging on your back but my son decided that he will deal with that aspect because he loves the way it looks
4.0,cute but didn't pick right size
4.0,"I love this item.  I do recommend a larger size ( 1 size up)  it runs a bit small.  Other then that I found the material to feel great against my skin.  I love the length and color.  It washes well no wrinkles.  I enjoy wearing this item.  I should have returned for a larger size but, I hate returning items.  Thank you!!"
4.0,"Nice for my aching feet. Ran little small, but will use inside for summer."
4.0,I loved everything about it but it was far too short for me and i'm 5'8 now mind you i'm thick so i was super happy it was wide enough for my north bay.
4.0,They're cool for basketball but not for working out. The other ones I bought are different material and better for working out. Overall still a good buy.
4.0,Nice material just on the big side
4.0,"I am really happy with the bracelet. The crystals are pretty and the evil eye amulets are colorful. However, be aware that it is super small. I have a really bony wrist and it is snug on me. I'm also concerned that the elastic might not hold up because I have to stretch it wide to slip it on. This being said, I am still happy with it."
4.0,Shorts. Who knew?
4.0,"Liked how each keychain was in an individual plastic zip baggie, all inside a cute mini gift bag. The big sis keychain I got has a little black smudge on it that's why only 4 stars"
4.0,Great color and looks good
4.0,Wore this as a part of my Halloween costume. I was Wanda Maximoff AKA Scarlet witch. Ran just a little small but it worked out fine. Definitely more of a thong swimsuit though 😂
4.0,It was requested that we go in costume to a birthday party for a 5 year old. We had a lot of fun.
4.0,"I really like this skirt! The only problem I have with it is that the elastic moves around a bit in the waistband (to be expected as most skirts like this do the same) and there was a teeny tiny stain on it, but I don't mind much. The color is great and exactly like the picture and as someone with long legs I love how it's a little bit longer in the back."
4.0,"Bought for wife, she loves the color. Good quality dress just fits too tightly. The material is not very forgiving either. The reason for a 4 star."
4.0,"My son bought these & he says they fit really well & likes them. He looses/breaks sunglasses all the time, so for an inexpensive pair, these have held up really well"
4.0,The sleeves right at the wrist was lose but the rest of the sleeve fit perfectly. Overall it’s great the way it came.
4.0,it looks and it feels great loved it
4.0,does its job for a ultra cheap price. not a luxury item.
4.0,"Comfy, good for travel. Just a bit small."
4.0,I wanted to love these so much but they just fit weird. They are squat proof but show every imperfection that you may have.<br />Update. After they read this review there customer service contacted us and gave us a full refund. Very impressed with there customer service. Thank you.
4.0,"good quality, more of a swing dress -- just falls straight down and out, really comfortable"
4.0,"A little small for me, but still very cute. Will be using when I start my business."
4.0,"It's cute and just average support. I'd wear this for something more low-key, but not running"
4.0,"Cute earrings. Smaller than I thought they'd be, but made a great gift."
4.0,"These are required as her socks for her school uniform. The students at her school get issued these that we pay for at the begging of the school year to wear with the school mandated loafers and also used in gym classes with cheap kockoff thin sole ked like shoes in white. Some students try to make a challenge to see how long they can get one pair to last without washing before ripping or tearing. So far the record is 1.5 school years set by my daughter in her freshman to junior year, her socks got so used the socks could almost stand on there own by the final month. During the summer of that year my daughter went sans socks including some jelly all rubber pumps. My daughter said the ribbing can tickle sometimes or it gets annoyingly uncomfortable when feet are very tired in the cheap loafers you have to wear."
4.0,"Although these yoga pants are not as flattering as Lulu Lemon, they are less than half the price and a good value for the money.  The fabric appears to be of good quality and holds it's shape.  The fit is perfect, I am 5'6"" 140 lbs and I bought the medium."
4.0,"Great price for a sharp looking watch. The closure for the band is tricky to use, and really needs to be redesigned."
4.0,I love this product even though it feel thin when you actually have it on it’s a different feeling.
4.0,"I think they are beautiful, but they are two different lengths."
4.0,"Don’t love it, but I like it. Boxier than I thought it would be."
4.0,I ordered 2XXL because the reviews said it runs small; I am 5'8&quot; and ordered extra larger size because I am tall.  But turn out too big; XL should be enough.
4.0,"Great buy, but came scrunched up in an envelope"
4.0,I knew this ran large and ordered it anyways. It's nice thick fabric. Good quality. It can be worn probably at 12months. It'd be a good baby shower gift. Super cute.
4.0,"Fast delivery! Exactly as it looks. Runs small so I bought a size larger, & it fits fine. It is a little shorter than what it looks like it picture. Hits me right at my waist. But I still love it."
4.0,This scarf is well made and super cute. The pocket is sewn in nicely and is discrete. We had to search for it. I ordered the navy blue. It was a nice shade of navy.
4.0,"I just came back from my trip to Ireland - loved it! and I didn't get a chance to buy this so I ordered this and I love this keychain I bought white and black sheet. But the black sheet fell off the keychain as it was for some eason not tightly attached to the keychain and I could not attach back, so I gave to my 5 year old nephew who loves it, it is beautiful, just not a keychain for me anymore.  however the white one is fine - I would recommend this sheep keychain"
4.0,"This dress is made with a beautiful, silky material but I don't really like the shape of it by itself. It's super flattering with a belt though and a really good length!"
4.0,"Very form fitting. You will see a lot of cleavage and maybe even nipple if not mindful. It's sexy, but you may need some tape to keep the girls shield."
4.0,"THE WINDER IS NICE, WORKS WELL SO FAR AND QUIET.  HOWEVER IT IS BIGGER THAN I THOUGHT AND TAKES UP A LOT OF ROOM.  THE LIGHT IS IN A BIZZARE PLACE, ONLY LIGHTING UP A SMALL PORTION OF THE BOX. OVER ALL THOUGH IT IS A GOOD PRODUCT BEAUTIFUL FINISH AND LOOKS VERY HIGH END FOR THE PRICE."
4.0,"The inside layer is the only one that’s a bit too thin, not wide enough. I’m planning to wear a skirt hoop underneath to increase the volume even more and will need to add fabric to the inner most layer to cover the hoop. The elastic waist band is also more like a small than a medium, but it will still work, as it should be worn on the high waist"
4.0,"Lightweight yet warm, comfortable and a nice color. Was a present from the spouse, so it's quite welcome."
4.0,BUENO!!!
4.0,i like it small for kids but dont like the colorful assecorries attach to it
4.0,"Unfortunately, mine came damaged, so I have to return it. Overall, it fits exactly as shown in the picture. I am 5'9&quot; 135 lbs. It's much softer than I was expecting (like yarn) so I am curious how it will hold up if you put it on over a wet swimsuit. I ordered the white and it is definitely true white."
4.0,Have worked well but just a bit short for me and one clamp has issues holding .overall a good product .id buy again
4.0,I dislike that the sticker was placed on the eye shield and when tried to clean it put a smear across it which made hard to see through so what can you clean it with I tried soapy water and it still was smeary looking so there need to be instructions on how to clean the eye shield other than that it would be a great product cause I would have purchased more.
4.0,"The helmet looked pretty good. Didnt fit me well, I have a tall head. It should be okay for someone with a round head."
4.0,"bottoms were great top too big for me, paired with different top works great"
4.0,Not for petite people
4.0,Had 'em a couple days. They seem very solid for the price ($6)
4.0,"Ok ladies, this is a great dress for the price! I got It in yellow and it looks great.  The fabric is thin so you will need a nude slip.  I am 5'4, 136 lbs and 34B.  I ordered a medium and it fits perfect."
4.0,"I like the fit and feel of this shirt. It's lightweight, comfortable, and very comfortably-flowy."
4.0,"Shorts were a little small but still really comfortable for the price. The drawstrings are long. Like ridiculously long. I had to cut mine. Other than that, decent shorts."
4.0,Perfect after c-section. Holds tummy in well. Only think I wish is they would cut down lower in back. These go half way up my back. Not very attractive but holds stomach in well!
4.0,"Cool LEGO tie clip that does more than simply get the job done.<br /><br />I feel very strongly in saying that I guarantee you'll get compliments when wearing this tie clip. I work in education and when I wear this tie clip in our elementary schools, I get flooded with students asking about my LEGO tie clip.<br /><br />The LEGO piece is authentic LEGO and looks great with almost any set of colors with your tie and/or shirt.<br /><br />I knocked one star off because it would have preferred a little more sturdy of mechanism to clip the tie. Full disclosure, I haven't had any issues, but it doesn't feel the sturdiest. I may just be overthinking it as well since I haven't had any issues thus far.<br /><br />Overall, if you're a LEGO fan, then this is a must buy.<br /><br />If you found my review helpful, please let me know below. If you have any questions, don't hesitate to ask.<br /><br />Happy bricking!"
4.0,Very very cute set!  This was purchased as a gift for a chicken lover and they loved it!  This set is small and dainty.  Everything came in a little jewelry box with a polishing cloth.
4.0,Loveee it. I wear a small and I know the sizes are off so I ordered an extra large and it was a tiny bit big. I could have gotten a large.<br /><br />But seriously it’s a great shirt. Super nice material.
4.0,"My son liked it, the hood is a little tight."
4.0,its gorgeous and well made for this type of jewelry wish I had seen the set with the earring included before purchasing this
4.0,Way to big for 8 year old. Decent quality product.
4.0,"This is a flattering little dress, but the material is quite thin. I'm between a size 4 and 6 and the M fits, but is a bit snug up top (I'm a 34D). I think the length really makes the dress, as it's near the knee (I'm 5'7). Any shorter and I think it would look too small. With spanx, looks seamless and very feminine."
4.0,"Love the fit , but hate hand wash and dry."
4.0,"-A little expensive for plastic cases.<br />-/+ Average sized for small medium glasses.<br />+Love colors,& theyre transparent you can see in.<br />+Super fast to wipe down.<br />+The foam piece inside isnt glued down so you could remove for a little more space."
4.0,Decent value for the money. I like the RFID feature
4.0,Mi esposa quedó encantada con este regalo
4.0,It came packaged pretty well. My husband liked it. It fits perfectly and looks amazing.
4.0,"I may have over estimated my own size, but the jacket is nice. Let's see if it does well in Chicago's fall weather."
4.0,"it is a very pretty dress but the ruffles were a bit odd. they are a bit bigger than the pictures imply and it looked a little odd so i returned. other than that, it runs true to size. i am a size 6 but i ordered a medium and it was a bit big around the waist so i would say it runs true to size."
4.0,"Great dress. Fits true to size. I am 5'2 156 Lbs and I got size L and it fits perfect. So glad. I would have given it a 5 star rating but it is just a tiny bit short. Looks great with tights and short boots. So, go for it and  purchase this dress I even wear it to work with the tights and boots, and a short cardigan. So comfortable."
4.0,there a little small but I would definitely recommend them
4.0,"It fit me perfectly and looked great, but there was a little too much glitter for my taste (even though there was still only a little glitter to begin with)."
4.0,Very cute dress but runs right.
4.0,"It's a little small for a daith piercing, especially if it's still healing. It's a great earring for your fully healed daith Piercing."
4.0,Worked out just right for my son's karate class!
4.0,Great for kids in daycare
4.0,"For one this bracelet was beautiful, the way it sparkles in the sun. I have received many complements on it. It was a little smaller than I thought but I still rather really liked it. The only reason I gave it four stars is after two days one of the hearts fell out. I contacted the seller and they got back to me right away and were very kind, have also already sent me a replacement. So all in all great product and great costumer service. I would gladly buy from them again. ;)"
4.0,Will wear on casual occasions
4.0,Absolutely beautiful and delicate necklace. Love the different sides. Unfortunately mine broke a couple days ago and today I realized my return period closed yesterday :(
4.0,"This product is pretty decent. It is a bit expensive for what it is, but the quality is there. The ring itself looks aged and worn, which is a nice touch. The inscriptions are all correct and in-line with the game. The ring seems fairly sturdy as well.<br /><br />The leather is pretty thin. And stretchy. I'm not 100% sure it's actually even leather. It feels more like a felt-type material. But it gets the job done.<br /><br />Overall, it's a good product, properly replicated and true to its video game counterpart."
4.0,"This is a cute inexpensive cover-up. It runs a little small and maybe slightly shorter than it looks in the Picture; Therefore, I would recommend maybe going up a size. It's definitely not a bad purchase for the price, and their customer service is &#34;Beyond Excellent&#34;!!!"
4.0,"Me gusto pero la parte de los hombros me queda grande es muy ancha de hombro a hombre y adelante se mira muy descubierto,por lo de más me gusto perfecto el largo la cintura muy bien"
4.0,Great shirt. Material is nice. Fit is small. I let it air dry.
4.0,"This is a beautiful leather men's bracelet. I haven't seen anything like it anywhere. The only problem is its too large for my wrist. I say I'm average size; 5' 9&#34;, about 170, athletic build, normal size wrist. If this bracelet were somehow adjustable, or if they came in different sizes, it would be perfect. Unfortunately, it's one size. The bracelet measures 8 3/4&#34; from clasp to clasp. I'm no expert on wrist sizing; but I would guess if your under 200 lbs. or have unusually thick or wide wrist, this bracelet is not your size. Maybe they will make an adjustable version one day. Until then, I'll keep doing wrist curls to try to fit mine!"
4.0,Pretty but very heavy.
4.0,outstanding for $20.00!!
4.0,"Though it could be smaller for me, 5'3"", I was able to adjust it to fit pretty well. It's supple and not too heavy. The pockets are very handy. I use it, mostly seated, to solder jewelry and it protects my clothes and lap from the occasional piece of dropped metal or  hot tweezers."
4.0,I got this for family reunions which definitely came in handy. I love the that each piece has a different figurine/design 😍.  The ringlets that comes attached to the design/figurine looks like it might rust. I haven't used them enough to 100% confirm my assumption but overall they're good.
4.0,Its great. only thing is it seems to be almost a little small for my glasses. and i dont have large glasses.
4.0,"They are pretty good.  They are super long, so I have to fold them over at the top, and the feet are really long.  Kind of hard to get on, but compression socks always are.  They are pretty cute, for compression socks though!"
4.0,Wonderfully warm so great for winter.
4.0,"I purchased this bag for my home health visits; it arrived pretty fast and well packaged.  IMO, the bag is too small especially the outer pockets.  My tablet fits very snug and it’s difficult to put in and take out if the bag. The inner pocket is roomier, but it doesn’t fit a standard BP machine or a bag it’s a thermometer and an oxypulse.  I won’t return it due to it been opened, but I ordered the original Hopkins bag for daily use."
4.0,I like product it arrived in time
4.0,"Very nice roomy, love color"
4.0,Right around the chest.
4.0,Crosses in the back fitted a bit weird
4.0,"I own other brands of tabi (Konomi, Fukusuke, etc), but I like these Toray brand tabi the most. They fit as expected, and are very comfortable. They do run slightly narrow, as is common with tabi. However, these are well made and do provide a little stretch. In my photos, I’ve provided comparison shots between the “men’s” S (21.5-22cm) and the “women’s” M (22.5-23.5).<br /><br />In shoes, I wear US women’s 5 - 5.5 / JPN 22 - 22.5cm. Width wise, the M were roomier, but length wise S was much better. Personally, I felt there was too much extra space at the heel with the M. Though when wearing zori, it’s almost unnoticeable. For those who are in between sizes, round up. There may be a little shrinkage after washing and drying, but not by more than 1/2 cm in my past experience as these are nylon and not cotton.<br /><br />Though the merchant has labeled these Toray tabi separately as men’s and women’s sizes, they are virtually exactly the same. Even the original labels on the package say nothing about gender sizes. For some reason, Kyoetsu is currently selling these tabi for different prices - the “men’s” tabi are cheaper than the “women’s” despite being exactly the same. If your size isn’t available in your gender category, just buy the corresponding size in what’s available. You’re getting the exact same tabi."
4.0,"It's nice but I need to get a necklace lengthener just to wear it and my neck isn't even big! I draped it over my neck for a picture to show that it wasn't broken or anything, but geeeeez it isn't long enough! It's not meant to be a choker necklace either, so I don't know why it would even be that small where I couldn't close it even if my neck was bigger. -.- it is nice. I wish I didn't have to buy something else just so I can wear it. (You can see the clasp in the pic too - come on now! That's ridiculous!)"
4.0,Nice but no size adjustment<br />it is made for a fat man or a very thick wrist
4.0,"Works perfectly! We use it for our basketballs and it’s been working great so far, pumps air efficiently."
4.0,Fast shipping with everything that is going on. And spot on with details. Nice and soft also.
4.0,"Shirt fit good, except a little baggy under arm area, but nothing a few stitches couldn't fix. There was a small hole on the left breast area like it had gotten snagged on something but nothing major, but all in all, good comfy shirt for the price."
4.0,Bought this lanyard after purchasing a different one that was too bulky I purchased this one and just love it! It is light weight and very pretty.
4.0,"After much searching on Amazon for a conservative dress I could wear to a Japanese wedding in Japan that isn't too large (as most dresses on Amazon are I've found), I finally found it! This dress covers and looks quite cute and right at the knee length (I'm 5'2&#34;). I'm getting a dress belt to add some life to it, but otherwise its great. It's much heavier than expected and well made."
4.0,very good product for the pricr.
4.0,I love the bracelet but you get what you pay for. I have other shamballah bracelets that were a lil more expensive and there is a difference.
4.0,"Bought them for my 6 year old, originally for in door soccer. But uses them for is all use."
4.0,"This fine ice cream man hat has all of the earmarks of a quality ice cream man hat product. Let's start with the legend.<br /><br />The hat says ICE CREAM MAN right there on the front of the hat.  Big and bold and in ALL CAPS. Serious-looking font. Nobody will mistake you for an astronaut or a beekeeper when you're wearing this hat (except for illiterate people, maybe). This hat is all about letting people know that you're an out-and-proud ICE CREAM MAN!<br /><br />The black visor is an ingenious touch.  It keeps the sun out of your eyes in outdoor settings where ice cream men often congregate.  I mean, who would have thought to put a visor ON A HAT?  Good design? It's damn near magical, it is.<br /><br />In regular use, the hat gives one a jaunty air and absorbs the sweat quite nicely. Also, kids seem to be naturally trusting of a man in an ice cream man hat so I made many new friends before I was tackled and led away from the elementary school playground in handcuffs.<br /><br />I did knock off a star because I believe that the photo is misleading.  I'll just warn other buyers here: IF YOU WANT A PORN 'STACHE, YOU MUST PURCHASE IT SEPARATELY.<br /><br />With that proviso, I can only say that for those in the market for an ice cream man hat, this is one."
4.0,The color is nice and my son loves it.
4.0,"I wore these to a holiday party and got raved reviews.  The design is cute, but the stitching is so thin I don't think I will be able to wear them more than 3x.<br /><br />But for the low price it was worth it!"
4.0,"The shirt seemed as described, and the sizing was accurate; however, I ended up returning it as I didn't like the cinching on the sides and wanted something less form fitting, but this is purely personal preference."
4.0,Nicely packaged. Fits fine.
4.0,Great jewelry came sooner than expected fits great but the pressure ball is a pain to get back on
4.0,"This is a cute cover-up.  The colors are not quite as bright as the picture as the fabric is somewhat sheer.  I'm only 5'1&#34; and this is the perfect length for me, keep this in mind if you are taller.  The sides have a 1-2 inch panel, I think to be flowy, so it adds a little extra width.  The girl in the pic is holding this side panel down.  It's still cute."
4.0,This was a perfect giveaway for a bachelorette.
4.0,"I bought this dress for my daughter's band and choir concerts and it's perfect.  her only complaint was the shoulders are a little wide and she was worried about the top slipping.  We did take the advice offered on other reviews to use a belt which dressed it up.  We had searched in several stores and didn't find a dress as nice at this price, the quality is good, I did order up a size based on other reviews, she's a medium so I ordered a large which might explain the top being a little too wide but everything else fit fine.  The color is true to the photo, the length is accurate and it's not stiff,it lays nicely and my daughter said it's comfortable to wear.  I would buy the dress again and look at other dresses from this company.  I held back on a star because of the shoulders, but my daughter is slim so it might be more her body type than the dress design."
4.0,I LOVED this head piece and it was so beautiful but unfortunately it was very cheaply made and broke after first use.
4.0,A little tighter in the chest than expected...tends to ride up my neck a little when playing sports.
4.0,Nice belt but a little on the thin side. You get what you paid for.
4.0,"Comfortable.<br />Looks good.<br />Fits well.<br />Seems to be good quality (I don't really know my good leather from my bad, but it feels durable)<br />Doesn't smell (some of the other leather products have reviews about noxious odors- this one is fine)<br /><br />My only complaint is that the buckle does not hold down the strap very well. I think that the metal loop that the strap goes through after you fasten it is slightly smaller than shown, so it does not lay flat. It can get caught on stuff, which is kind of annoying. (I have yet to see if anything can be done about it)"
4.0,Good variety and good quality
4.0,Works well. Need to thicken material on large square front
4.0,"Very lovely, have not actually worn the item yet, it was purchased for my beach wedding in August, will update after then."
4.0,They are very soft which is amazing. Run a little small. Will still wear them though.
4.0,Not extremely comfortable though.
4.0,"The fit of these are as expected, and they seem slightly thicker than other tights. They don't have tags and are sewn so that either side could be the front or back. My daughter said they are soft, stretchy, and comfortable, but wasnt too thrilled about the extra material on the seam by her toes (sometimes she gets weird about certain things with her clothes)"
4.0,I love these leggings but they run a little large.<br />I am 5’3 & 165lbs. I wish I would if ordered a medium.
4.0,"The dress is beautiful. The quality is good.  The rib at the neck does not fit properly, otherwise it would be a 5 star item."
4.0,Protecting eyes in public areas. Stylish also but they do fog a little when wearing a mask.
4.0,"Washable Reusable Breathable Comfortable Premium Cloth Masks More Than 20+ Fashion Designer Face Mask Cotton Face Coverings for Men and Women Adult Face Mask Shipping from USA (1058)<br /><br />The straps on this mask attach at the back of the head, sparing the ears from getting sore while holding the mask on the face.  They can be tightened and loosened by just giving a tug on the back.  This is much more convenient and comfortable than loops around the ears.  I do have concerns, however, about the thinness of the straps.  They're less straps and more like thin elastic.  Whether it will stand up over time remains to be seen.<br /><br />The mask itself is fine.  It's a standard two layer cotton mask.  Thin enough to not feel smothering yet thick enough so that you can't blow out a birthday candle through it (apparently that's the gold standard test for determining if a mask does what it's supposed to).  It's a bit larger than I like and that results in some gaps.  But let's face it, there's always going to be gaps.  These aren't medical grade masks and expecting them to function that way is unrealistic.  The size of it does allow for using mask brackets to keep it from touching my face without smashing the bracket into my face.  That's my preferred way of wearing it.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Mask is held on the face in a way that is not tiring for ears.  It's not at all uncomfortable to wear.<br />- Easy to adjust.  Easy to put on and take off.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- The elastic is thin and that could be a problem over time.<br /><br />Other:<br />- The mask itself is nothing special.  It's a pretty standard two layer mask that is somewhat larger than normal."
4.0,"Beautiful color, nice material and good fit."
4.0,"Beautiful color.  A bit snug, so it showed every flaw."
4.0,Soft and fits perfectly.  Super fast shipping.
4.0,Love the fit and color. Great wedding guest dress!
4.0,"Always buying slippers and these might be my favorite so far! Fits great (a little narrow at first but quickly spread out), nice and warm lining, stiff sole.<br />Only thing is I don’t really notice much cushion or memory foam, would like it to be a little cushier and more arch support. Otherwise great pair of slippers for the price!"
4.0,"Cute purse but it doesn't keep the structure too well. The stiffer liner in purse was bent in half the long way so it keeps wanting to go that way but u can just kinda bend t opposite to make it more balanced out. Very roomy and lots of pockets. But the front little one where the gold plate is, is not a useable pocket it's there for cosmetic purposes only."
4.0,Not the best quality but they are good for when I have a lot of guests in the house
4.0,A cute basic tee with a twist. This is comfortable and really cute. I think the length is perfect and it's not too thin. I can see myself wearing it a lot.
4.0,Love the look and the hobo style. It’s ALMOST too roomy inside and the inside pouches/pockets could be a bit deeper.
4.0,"This dress is super cute and comfy, but arrived with a hole in the pocket. It's a good length and fits pretty well, but the waist is a little large for my proportions. Overall I love it!"
4.0,I love it. Just worried about the pattern wearing off. Feels like iron on. I love it I want to stay looking like new forever and not peel off
4.0,Elegant looking shirt
4.0,Very flattering with a fabulous print and perfect length.
4.0,Shirt was way to big! But it's still cute
4.0,"These are good quality briefs.  But ultimately I returned them.  I'm an awkward size (35&#34; waist).  Mediums tend to be too tight and larges tend to be too loose.  I had ordered the medium and they fit good in the legs, but it was smushing my junk.  I wish they came down lower on the thigh though.  Did not have a problem with the return."
4.0,"Fits great, though I don't remember an option to select a size and seems I got the small/medium.  Still, I'm almost 6 foot and comes down to my knees, so it's a good size.  And, this isn't anywhere near worth returning it, but the right side pocket is upside down.  At most I only need 1 pocket (for my phone) so it's fine, just kinda funny.  Fast delivery, good quality!"
4.0,Love feeling of shirt and fit
4.0,"good belt. belt stretches easier with less resistance that an old belts purchased 10+ years ago at California street fair. we will see how they hold up, but seems well constructed. size seems accurate."
4.0,blouse was nice but somewhat small.
4.0,Lightweight. Pretty item for girls.
4.0,"Love this dress! Got lots of compliments. Looks more expensive than what I paid for it. Quality is great. My only complaint was the bottom of the neck band dug into my trapezius muscle when I was sitting so I kept having to adjust my dress to not have so much stress on that part. Even still I would recommend for a formal event, date night or just because. I wore it with cute cowgirl boots and it was adorable."
4.0,Cool Design
4.0,It was really sheer.
4.0,A lot longer than the picture shows.
4.0,Elegant tag
4.0,what I wanted very pleased with the item
4.0,Comfortable but really high. Like to my boobs high. I’m 5’1 and wear a 4x so maybe not a universal issue.
4.0,"Get LOADS of compliments on this ring. Very sparkly. People assume its the real deal, however I think it looks fakey. But I do like it."
4.0,"This dress is really cute, but not as I expected. I returned bc I didn’t like the fabric and it was too large."
4.0,"Pretty, but not as vivid in color as I would like.  The style is nice though, and looks nice on."
4.0,Beautiful!  I was worried these would be too long (the product description is accurate) but they look great.  My new favorite earrings.  They are a little heavy but not too bad. I wish they had come with plastic backs so I didn't worry about them falling out.
4.0,Really light and great grip for grainy turf. Great for speed and quick cuts very durable and not to mention LOOK awesome!
4.0,So I'm going to write a review like the kind I appreciate. So I gave it 4 stars only because it's a tad wide and a strap falls down here and there but it doesn't cause the romper to fall down so aside from that it's adorable! My daughter is 1 and weighs 26 pounds ( she's a chunk ❤️) and the 12-18 month fits perfectly aside from the straps being a bit wide. The color is so bright and pretty and looks just like the picture. And the material is so soft and stretchy which is perfect for my little squishy. I'd definitely buy it again but I might want to attach something to bring the straps closer together.
4.0,"Loved the top, the bottom cute was a little too high."
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:43950955a79227d36828153bf9a7b889]] I expected them to fit a bit snug , so I can’t get mad at company . They only had a smaller size left . The girls on other reviews had explained that. But I hoped for the best. Happy I can at least fit them. I’m 135 5”7 . I have a butt. I’m able to squeeze in them . It’s not the best fit to my backside ... but not pancake flat ."
4.0,This passport cover is leather and was inexpensive.  I liked the fact it had extra pockets for carrying credit cards.
4.0,Supercool glasses but felt smaller than I expected. Gonna use them tho
4.0,"Just a little shorter than I expected but so far, they're great otherwise!"
4.0,Beautiful dress. It came with one of the button attachments broken & customer service was great!!!<br />Love the dress
4.0,color is more green than blue but is still nice
4.0,Son like it
4.0,"This shirt fits like a juniors size, not an adult size. I had read other reviews and ordered a large instead of a medium and it fits perfect. Very cute, lightweight shirt."
4.0,A little small but overall nice.
4.0,"These shoes are great for more than just the water! They have a very flexible sole that is great for your active child. They look great (I do wish they came in more neutralish colors like black, white, grey etc but beggars cant be choosy). There are tiny little smile faces on the strip going down the back with the word &#34;smile&#34; I dont care for. As well as some construction quality that is subpar but not worth returning the shoes for the mishaps. All in all these shoes were exactly what we needed for a trip to the beach. I and my son, are pleased! He likes them and they will hold up until he outgrows them."
4.0,Love them good for camping
4.0,"I really, really was surprised to have received this gift! I am constantly looking for items to enhance the look of my body. The woman waist trainer panties are lightweight and comfortable and most of all the support is well noticed!"
4.0,"These are very pretty and small enough to be real looking. I didn't want anything too flashy! They came very quickly and I have sensitive ears, and they didn't bother me even while sleeping. The only negative at all is that the backs didn't stay on well. I wear my hair down and the backs pulled off easily."
4.0,"I received this Vintage Shield Gem Belly Button Ring by BodyJ4You about a week ago – I have worn it every day since receiving it and have had no issues with it as far as skin irritation or with the quality of its construction. The ornamental shield is about 1/2 inch in diameter and the total length of the surgical steel belly button ring is about 1 inch. It seems well made and is definitely very pretty. It is a little bigger than most belly button rings that I have worn, but I am getting used to it. I have read a few reviews that talked about the ring breaking… if that happens, I will update my review to reflect that accordingly.<br /><br />Overall, I am pleased with this Vintage Shield Gem Belly Button Ring by BodyJ4You."
4.0,"I only give this dress 4 stars because it does run a little small. Other than that,  I could have kept this dress and been very happy with it. It is a soft, comfy material, not super thick, but not see through. The color was a shade I love, but the fit of this dress set it to be returned. It is a straight cut and if I was looking for a more snug dress I would have kept it, but I wanted just a little more breathing room. If you like that slightly snug look this is the dress for you.  I can imagine all the ways this dress could be worn."
4.0,A little bit too wide and a tad long for the size expected but otherwise nice shoes!
4.0,"Boss bought me this, good quality and doesn't let hair stick to you. I got a large. Not sure what the zippers in the pockets are for but they're big and deep for holding scissors and combs. My front zipper broke off because it got caught on the fabric, didn't break off till I literally ripped it off of me so good quality strong zipper. Maybe make more colors for this, id like a purple to replace this one."
4.0,"I ordered the yellow scarf and received it very quickly.  Might have been only 3 days before I got it.  It is very cute and great for spring since it is light weight.  I would say product is as described, however my only complaint is that it is a little too long for my taste, but for the price I'm happy with it."
4.0,Gave it to my niece and she was thrilled with it.  Nice value for the money.
4.0,"Great products, but take too long to arrive. Almost a month. Other than this, the product was as expected."
4.0,"Very cute. Just be sure to wear white or beige underwear with them, dark panties will show through the fabric."
4.0,"I liked it, but not for me. I tried to like it, but it wasn't my style. I returned. I got a large but should've got a medium."
4.0,"I love the looks of these earrings. Also I have worn at least 2 of them overnight with no problems. (I have worn the clear one and the green one both once overnight) with no issues. Also, they are long enough for my piercings, so that's good too. So overall, I feel like these earrings are worth the price. :).<br /><br />Also. These are the first earrings I changed into after my piercing had healed (about 2 weeks before the 10 month mark), and they didn't cause any problems with the piercing so I'm happy about that. :)."
4.0,Great i paid 200 for identical ones about 5 yrs ago except for being polarized is the only difference thanks
4.0,"I absolutely adore the Le Mou Women's Cold Shoulder Top with Ruffle Sleeve Detail. It is made using a lightweight polyester material that feels silky soft, and the shoulder cut-outs give it a fun and flirty look. I like that I can have shoulder cutouts without exposing my bra straps.<br /><br />I am so used to vanity sizing that I took a chance and ordered this in size small. It was my only option. However, it runs a bit smaller than expected and closer to a size x-small. I measured it at 17 1/2""  wide at the top. I am wondering if I would require a medium or large in this top in order for it to work.<br /><br />Even though I have narrow shoulders, my 36DD chest was somewhat flattened because woven fabrics are not forgiving. The fabric won this fight!<br /><br />It is cute and sexy top, but you may want to size up."
4.0,"I wanted to love these shoes.  They are a rare color and look great... In pics and in the box.  When I tried them on I was like ""WTF?! is there still paper in these?""  The tongue is so thick that I can barely lace them so that each side of the shoe covered the tongue. Ive never seen shoes like this before.  I skated for years and wore skate shoes even longer.  None of my shoes ever had a tongue so thick you couldn't lave them up.  I wore them around the house for a couple days thinking maybe I'd get used to them.  Not a chance.  The tongue makes the shoe look way too small for my feet.  Like they are about to bust open. lol!  Anyway... As much as I didn't want to... I had to return them."
4.0,"as described presses on noose a little bit but is not so bad, only reason I am giving this 4 stars is because ear part came broken it is minimal and can tell unless you have it in your hands and really close (more like a chip long thing piece) other than that it ok (this was broken from where it came from because I could not find the broken piece on the box"
4.0,"These boots are super cute! The design is gorgeous and they look great! But they are definitely not functional for wearing for a long time! They are photo shoes not shoes to wear all night.. I wore them to a concert and I honestly could pretty much feel the floor cus the soles and bottoms of the shoes are so thin.. but hey they are super cute and you get what you pay for so I don’t mind it ! They are good for exactly what I wanted them for, country concerts which I attend 2-3 times a year and since I won’t be wearing them on a weekly basis there perfect for me!"
4.0,Great costume. However daughter wears a size 2 American and the ladies large only fit up to her thigh. She had to get a men’s medium.
4.0,But the backings are terrible and they only give you the exact amount.  No extras. There were at least 3 that weren't shaped right so I have to use backings from the others when I wear them but other than that I like them and wear them daily.
4.0,Love the band. Multiple styles are great and bands are durable. The only issue is the color. Not what I expected.
4.0,Some of them were hard to screw off but they are pretty heavy and durable for the value of the products . I like the variety of choices I have and so far it hasn’t turned at all like most products from amazon
4.0,Fit size is great- very comfortable.
4.0,"The edges of the ribbon are a little rough, but it's cute."
4.0,I wish the belt had a wider band. It does fit.
4.0,I ordered a medium and it is a little big but nothing a hot water can’t fix . It’s cute and my bff loves it
4.0,The strings are super long but it’s a cute outfit
4.0,"This product works great. If you want a shaper that fits well, doesn't roll at your waist, and give you a nice hourglass shape, the mid height with boning is for you!!<br /><br />I've had issues with love handles and back fat my whole life. It's hard for me to find pants that fit properly because I have a very high natural waist, no matter what my size is. So pants that are supposed to fit anywhere below the belly button cut into my back/side fat and give me a very uncomfortable muffin top. I'm constantly trying to pull them back up over my love handles. This isn't working well with the prevailing fashion of high-waisted pants and semi-cropped shirts.<br /><br />....Enter the Werena shaper! This thing helps smoosh my love handles up into a more normal position. My pants fit over my hips like they are supposed to. It also sucks in my tummy. I can tuck in shirts without worrying about my belly pudge bulging out like an old man with a beer belly.<br /><br />The only reason this doesn't get five stars is because the thong part is way too wide and bulky for me. I only ever wear thongs, and don't have this problem with any other undies. I'm not sure if it's just the placement of the seams or what, but if I wear this for a full day, by afternoon my lower buttcrack is chafing. It's honestly pretty painful. Not to mention embarrassing, as I have to find a place at work to stick my hand down my pants and dislodge what's started to feel like a pool noodle from the depths of my buttcrack.<br /><br />PLEASE find a way to make the seams flatter or the thong thinner, ok? I really don't want to give up on one of my favorite undergarments."
4.0,Love my dress.
4.0,Shoes are adorable.  Little 'hard' as expected - &#34;croc like&#34;.<br /><br />They do run a little big IMO but toddler has no issues 'walking' in them.  Mostly have to be careful when in a shopping cart or being carried that they do not fall off.  With the size they should get us through summer!<br /><br />She loves putting them on and off by herself!
4.0,"I wear a size 9, and these are an exact fit.  The cushion is quite thick, which makes these very comfortable.  They are big, fluffy and warm, and they give me a fair amount of arch support (for a slipper).  However, I bought the white ones and that was a BIG mistake - the slippers looked like they'd been through the wars after just 2 days.  They pick up everything, so I have to wash them often.  They're holding up well after 2 months, considering all the washes.  It's not that I'm some kind of neat freak, it's just that I want my slippers to look generally clean.  I think ACORN should offer them in black or navy or brown or something like that if they're going to be made with this material.  I had to buy a different pair of slippers to use when these are in the wash.  Still, I like them and would buy them again in a darker color.  I would highly recommend them for someone who keeps their floors pristine."
4.0,"Worth the money. Light, comfortable and breathable. Will definitely order more. Highly recommend."
4.0,Runs a little small still like the shirt
4.0,"Wow, this dress is so comfy I almost didn’t want to take it off. It’s got a very soft cotton T-shirt type material on top and a thicker silky material on bottom. I’m 5’9 and 160 pounds and ordered a large, fits perfectly. I love the pockets too, only thing I would change is it’s a little loose around the armpits."
4.0,"I always use these tights.  They are great and doesn’t run as fast as the other ones.  However, one of the tights didn’t come with the then cardboard box.  Seems like someone opened it and stuck it back in the packaging.  With everything going around these days, who knows who touched the stockings."
4.0,the  material not so good but its soooooooooo cute
4.0,"There a little small so it's hard to see what there are, but still cute."
4.0,They are adorable could really never figure out if they are really leather. So if they are not true leather they should lower the price to at least $20 there is a chemical smell but I am airing and plan to wipe down before wear. Will not go with out socks just in case four star because of add not being clear on actual material it say fake leather at the top then down further says real leather. Not good business at all and also the chemical smell childrens shoes definitely should not be using toxic chemicals.
4.0,This is ok not exactly what I was looking for but made it work by tying it in front.  The dark spot on back is not centered but it’ll do
4.0,"Overall I love these. Design, fit, thickness, warmth, comfort. My only complaint, only 95% cotton. I realize for a stretchy pant this is about as good as it gets. I will buy again when I need another pair for sure, I just wish it was 100% cotton. But highly recommend these"
4.0,"Super cute!! But our little one is way too small for it yet, he is 4 weeks old. Maybe in a couple of months it will fit."
4.0,This is a cute onesie. We got a blue but it was more light green. It feels nice and good quality.
4.0,Cups are a little small. Go one size up when ordering. Otherwise good value for money.
4.0,really cute and my daughter loves them but they are a little bit big. Fits fine with socks though.
4.0,Really cute but they cracked a little
4.0,It's cute. A bit smaller than expected but I got it on sale.
4.0,"These are nice and “squat proof” and aren’t sheer when you bend over. The high and thick waist is nice and secure. These didn’t roll down or fold when I bend over. I’m not sure I’ll wear them as much as my LL leggings because the crotch seems to sink a bit and I have to grab around the front thigh area and pull them up. I am a little more round in the hips and backside, so maybe a better fit for less curves. I’m 5’6” 150lbs for reference. I think if I sized up the hips would fit better but the top band wouldn’t fit the same."
4.0,"First, let me say, this piece is gorgeous. The lace detail is to die for, and it is -so- sexy. My only warning is that I have a long torso, and it gives me a wicked wedgy. The material is polyester organza, so it is pretty stiff. I love it anyway, and would recommend to other women as well! The shorter you are, the better this will fit."
4.0,These are fine if you like knee highs. They stay up on the leg and the color is dark enough. Not sure why they don't just come in black.
4.0,"I  like the opal as a stone and the earrings matched my ring. I think they are a little small, but workable if you have more than one ear piercings in each ear."
4.0,The horse's nose is pretty elongated but it looks like the picture so no false advertising.
4.0,Beautiful color and cute dress. I ordered a size up based on reviews but it was way too big. Order your standard size.
4.0,Disappointed that it was way too small but I am keeping it for when i am too.
4.0,Really pretty ring considering the low price that I paid for it.
4.0,Love the look. Super cute.
4.0,"This grid-it organizer cleaned up all the mess in my bag. I was able to fit all my little knick knacks into it. The elastic is very, very tight, and holds everything firmly in place, albeit it becomes quite an annoyance to put in and remove things for the very same reason.<br /><br />The grids are not distributed evening - this is my only qualm. You'll have to figure out a strategic way to fit stuff in, and sometimes you might not be able to fit certain things in because the elastic straps simply don't allow for it. Maybe I just haven't figured out a good system yet. Whatever it is, this is still a great investment for a clean, tidy bag."
4.0,"4 stars because sizing is so off. Beautiful dress and better quality than I expected. Sizing is way off, I'm a women's large and ordered the large and XL just I'm case and the XL barely fit. Returning both and reordering the XXL. I knew it would be on the small side coming from China, but did not expect to have to order XXL. If you're a size 14 with a large bust, go ahead and order XXL. The Large would probably fit a size 8-10 and XL fit 10-12 comfortably."
4.0,JUST WHAT MY TWEENS LIKE. GREAT COLORS.
4.0,Somewhat smaller than I expected but it still fit. Hopefully I'll br a few pounds lighter by next summer.
4.0,Good shoe . But the side volcro strab had a thick plastic thing cover to add some look this really make it looks funky but if you lay down on your side you might feel uncomfortable as this thick plastic thing might feel intacy to your goot joint bone .
4.0,Great shirt!  Looks just like the picture and washes well.  It does run a little small so size up if you want it loose fitting.
4.0,"Very nice bag.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because the top zipper doesn't close all the way, it buckles at the end a bit.  The leather is very nice, and other than the problem with the zipper it's very well made."
4.0,It came very quickly it was a decent material though I think I could have gotten away with getting it just a little bit smaller.
4.0,"Haven’t used it yet, but looks great!"
4.0,"cute sweater, fits as expected and looks like the picture. soft once the chemical smell out of the package is washed off. deducted one star because there is no care instructions tag and i suspect tumble drying this would cause shrinkage, so i’m going with cold wash on gentle and laying flat to dry."
4.0,My neck is too small
4.0,"It's a nice sweater but I usually wear XL and the 3XL fit perfectly, maybe a bit snug"
4.0,"Wonderful basic dress. Im usually a 12-14, followed advice of fellow posters on sizing, and ended up very satisfied. Wish waist had a drawstring (torso of dress is longer than mine), but super pleased. Plus, who doesn't love pockets."
4.0,The color is great and the fill is just right to keep you warm. The zippers could be better.
4.0,My old eyes can read this easily and the color is very pretty!
4.0,"Fits pretty well. The sleeves are just tight enough to give you that sleek look. Also has pretty thick material, so you won't have to worry about underwear showing through, and it keeps you a bit cozy. Great for fall I would say. Also has pockets which aren't noticeable when you're not using them. Colors are just as saturated as you see in the photo.<br /><br />The only gripes I had was the hem and the length. The hem between the skirt and the torso as it fits a bit awkwardly on me as I like to accentuate my waist and this sits a bit higher than I would like. It has this sort of awkward middle ground where its too high to accentuate the waist and too low to accentuate the bust. However, if you have a larger bust this style would probably flatter you. The type of stitch used in the hem also causes the skirt to flair out a bit at the top but the skirt has more of a tube shape so it doesn't really continue to flair out at the bottom. I also noticed that the skirt is just a few centimeters too short than I would like it to be. Which is great for walking in flats, but not great if you are on the tall side."
4.0,"Not for warmth.  More for style.  I am only giving a 4 star due to the stitching not being perfect in all places.  I receive compliments on them daily.  They likely will not last more than one season, however."
4.0,"This was perfect for my little ones party, it fit well and I got a lot of compliments. No gloves included, but it’s a great costume and worth the buy."
4.0,"Runs big, the material is very thin. My daughter really likes it though and the color is great. It’s not very warm, it is definitely a summer cover up."
4.0,"stretch out after the first wear, but they are still very comfy and have held up after multiple washes"
4.0,"Very cute! I got a size up for a cozier feel, and it fits great. One of the appliqués on one side is coming off slightly, but it’s an easy fix."
4.0,"I wanted to wash this duster before I reviewed it.  It's very soft, warm and comfortable. It washed very nice (no wrinkles) with very little shrinkage. My only complaint is these dusters run LARGE. I am 5' 10&#34; 195 lbs. I take a size 14 dress. I ordered a medium and it's really big on me.  I kept it since I only wear it around the house. I purchased a second duster of another color and I ordered a small which fits perfectly. Tiny people would not be able to wear this duster."
4.0,"This cardigan is very comfy and fits really well. I'm 6'2"" and 215lbs. The large fit really well but the arms feel a bit baggy. I originally got an XL which was way too big. The quality is great and hasn't faded at all in the wash since I got it. It doesn't shrink in the wash so if it's not the right size make sure to exchange it for a better fit."
4.0,Love the outfit! Top runs a little small. I want to buy more!
4.0,"This product is mostly cotton - so not stretchy like I thought it would be - sleeves are the stretchy material..  A little tighter through the abdomen/hips than I anticipated, but fit is still comfortable.  I've received lots of compliments on the look of the top.  Really cute on!"
4.0,"It's a great vest, but it was baggy."
4.0,"It's a bit short. Perfect if you ask me. ;) my wife likes it, and I think I like it even more."
4.0,Wanted to love this but it was too small so I will be returning. Definitely size up!
4.0,Love very colorful!
4.0,Love the colors!  Fits well. Comfortable. Already have Oalka yoga pants so confident these will be functional and stylish. Wearing small size.
4.0,"My husband likes these so far, they are a good thickness and seem to be good quality, Will see how they hold up."
4.0,I LOVE this bag everywhere I go .. I receive compliments.
4.0,"It’s super cute. Used it only once so far, and the quality seems to be sturdy. The clear material really helps seeing where you’re going."
4.0,the clips fall off but case are ok
4.0,This is my third pair. Love them.
4.0,Not rained yet but wife likes its looks.
4.0,"Much smaller than I expected, but very cute! Got it as a gift for my mom, I think she’ll love it."
4.0,"Great value for the money! The choker portion of the gold cowrie necklace fits like an actual choker on me, which is rare when you have a skinny neck. They’re a very bright ‘gold’ and I wouldn’t hate it if they looked a bit more expensive, but I’m loving the beachy look for summer!"
4.0,"Luv the abalone and the size.  Comfortable, easily kept on overnight."
4.0,"Fast service, & good product, Just a little large for me."
4.0,OK.....
4.0,The fit was pretty good I will have to have the top adjusted but overall I am happy with it.
4.0,So cute! Big but she will grow into it!
4.0,Love this.  Having a great summer with one bag and 4 kids at the beach or pool. Its so light so never feels heavy as it fits more and more stuff.
4.0,They are good just one thing the cat ears ARE NOT A HEADBAND they are actually clips. Other than that the items are super soft and comfortable. I received them 1+ month earlier than I was suppose to.
4.0,Not as soft as I thought it would be but it washes and wears well.
4.0,Purchased as a gift . The recipient said that it fits like it should and is very comfortable . The stitching is good and the screen printing looks very nice . All in all I would call this a nice sweatshirt and very reasonably priced .
4.0,"Light weight fabric, they do run small do order one size larger"
4.0,I got this dress even thought the reviews were awful. It was cheap and I thought super cute so I took the risk. I was surprised to find that it for very well. Elastic waste band. Great length. I got a size small (even though the reviews said it runs really small) but it for perfect. The only thing I had to adjust was were the top parts sit on the side under the underpit. It flared out so much it looked bad so I just quickly tacked it with needle and thread. It’s a great dress for the price. I’ll be wearing this to another wedding this year! I got many compliments on it too!
4.0,Adorable swim bottoms. Way short though. I wish I would have bought one size up to be more comfortable.
4.0,I love this dress but I like stuff that flairs out a bit more. It's not really a structured fabric so it does show my love handles a little.
4.0,forgot to mention they we're hand wash.  grr.
4.0,Gave as a teacher gift. She loved it
4.0,Love them but had to return the first pair and get a bigger size
4.0,"I liked this costume for the price. The color changes to a grey when it stretches, but I didn’t mind. It felt comfortable and breathable without being see through."
4.0,"I like the material.  The Size I (6-8) fits more snug than anticipated. Overall, I recommend this product."
4.0,"Amazing and once you get them on you won't even know you're wearing them only one issue, they are very difficult to put them on and take them off, they wear tight. Other than that, they are amazing"
4.0,Love how it fits in my boob area it's a little snug in the tummy area so I suggest  ordering this dress in a size larger the your actual size<br />I would order from this line again I just now know the run small
4.0,I normally wear size a men's 10.5 shoe. I initially ordered men's size 11. That shoe was too large. I exchanged the shoe for a men's size 10.  The size 10 fits perfect.
4.0,"Just a little TOO THICK formu line of work ,but I’m pleased with them"
4.0,"for cold weather motorcycle riding. have to refitted to fit me, style is not bad"
4.0,I have had a lot of compliments on this inexpensive ring. It is a great conversation piece.
4.0,comfortable and durable fabric.. it would be perfect but the crotch is a little low and makes it fit a bit odd and tight in the thigh area
4.0,"These black socks do indeed reduce odor. The material is very soft and smooth and the material feels like its very good. I think these would do best in an office environment as dress socks, though. Why? They're very thin and I'd not want to wear these all day long in a job where I have to stand or walk all day long. There's not enough cushion in these socks. That's how I see it."
4.0,lovee this dress...
4.0,"for the price it's ok. but if you r looking for something of quality, look somewhere else."
4.0,A true New Era Cap - not a cheap Chinese Knock off
4.0,This dress was exactly like the pic. It came quickly and is a good quality.  It has a lining underneath.  I gave it 4 stars because the lining in the back is sewn to the dress so it rides up a little. Other than that i am pleased.
4.0,"Lots of bells and whistles for the money. The men’s size Large fit me (5’ 10”, 170 lb., 42” chest, 34” waist) perfectly. My ‘complaints’ are the following:<br /><br />1. It puckers at the armholes where the elastic is sewn in.<br />2. It is somewhat heavy and bulky, due to the 3 layers. Not ideal for travel or golf, IMO.<br />3. It really does not pack all that well in a 20-22” carry-on for travel.<br /><br />I’m still going to keep it. The smaller armholes make it more trim fitting than oversized, at least in the size that I purchased. Glad I did NOT go down a size as was suggested by several reviewers."
4.0,Fit but I prefer a little looser fit. I was worried that after 1 wash it would be too small. Sent it back and got immediate credit to my account. I might order it later 1 size up. I had ordered several different tops at the same time and kept the rest. I ordered some leggings to go with the other tops instead. The top was very nice and the material soft. If you're big chested and have the Momma pouch I'd order a size up.
4.0,"These are good shoes.  I think arch support is difficult because everyone's foot is different.  These are not cushy shoes, but the arch support is there.  If you have narrow feet, these will not work for you.  However, if you need some room, these are great.  I am happy with them, but they are a bit stiff and hard.  I know with time they will become more supple...that's the way of leather.  I'm glad they will last a good while, the construction is excellent."
4.0,"Runs a little small, but I love the quality"
4.0,Not much of an air hole for breathing. But the price was great and just what my son wanted for trick or treating.
4.0,Great watch for the money. I set the time a few minutes fast and it holds time perfectly. Great deal. If you want a nice inexpensive watch. Buy it.
4.0,"I love these earrings. Only problem their too heavy. It might just be because I use to have plugs, but their really heavy and the stick is too long. I love them though I just can't use them too often."
4.0,"I was looking for longer shorts but these were almost too long, kind of an awkward length. I'm 5'6 and they hit just below my knees."
4.0,"These are beautiful, but they are very large which I didnt' realize they would be !"
4.0,This was bought for my daughter and she loves it.
4.0,Nice dress I expected to be por tight since I ordered XS but is fine. Great quality and price
4.0,I get so many compliments on this dress! It fit as expected and I love that it has pockets.
4.0,"Actually have not had time to try yet, but seems like it will work just fine for my application."
4.0,Fits as expected but I have given it 4 stars because I cannot easily pull them on and off as I would have wanted. I use them for travel in the airport and I would have preferred that they are easy to put on and off.
4.0,"Ordered the wine elephant and black namaste one and they are true to picture.  I am glad I read the reviews for this brand and purchased an XL, for reference I'm 5'7 130lbs and these run extremely small. The XL fits great, I can shrink them and still be ok. If you are larger than these would be really tight. But overall the product is well made and shipped super fast. I am happy I bought them and will definitely buy again."
4.0,"Took forever to arrive, but it did come from Texas during their unprecedented freeze. The sleeves are a bit long, but it is true to colour."
4.0,"Bought these because Amazon AI had noticed I'm buying underwear lately, particularly bamboo/viscose, and sent me what looked like a good deal on 4 pair.  I've  only had them for a few days, seem to wash and dry OK, are comfortable.  What I can't judge yet is their durability over time."
4.0,This is a repurchased product.
4.0,"The pearls were beautiful and lustrous.  Length and size as advertised.  Comes well packaged and promptly.  However, the clasp is very thin and difficult to open and close.  I will have to get that replaced.  I have asked the sellar if they could provide any other options when buying these pearls because I would like to give them as a gift."
4.0,"It's nice, I love it"
4.0,"I love my bag and the color! I wish it were a little bigger,  but overall happy with it!"
4.0,"I am 5'5-5'6 and around 127-130 lbs.  I ordered this shirt hoing it would be slightly loose fitting, like the picture.  It's actually fitting, but not skin tight. I wouldn't return it and plan on wearing it with cute jeans, boots and a batwing cardigan, but maybe order another in a bigger size for a baggier look?"
4.0,Got mine with few scratches.  But overall it looks authentic so still giving 4 stars but please ship your items with even a generic bag next time
4.0,Fit well but the band stretches out easily.
4.0,"I purchased the Opal Burgundy glasses. The ""cats eye"" was a little much for me. Wish seller or Amazon posted more pics & specs to make a better purchasing decision. Also, no Prime was available and glasses took a while to get to me.<br />In addition, these are clear lenses, not sunglasses. Should be sold as a frame, not a pair of sunglasses. The glasses themselves look nice & fit pretty well. Also comes with an amazon authenticity as there are many knockoffs on the market. See below for more specs and my photos.<br /><br />Size Bridge A B ED Temple Length<br />54 16.0 54.0 39.3 58.4 140.0"
4.0,"These were a bit smaller than expected. However, once they are on they do stand out and can be worn daily or for any occasion!"
4.0,"It is nice design, but the size of sleeves did not fit: the sleeves are too tight, hardly can move arms; also the front part is too short, especially when I raise a bit my arms - so have to return. Give 4 stars as overall it is nice and would fit someone else."
4.0,"I love the color and material of the dress. The top part is definitely more form fitting than the bottom, so think of this when choosing a size. The bottom drapes so nicely and the cross over on the chest rides great without coming apart.  This can easily be dressed up for a night out or paired with cute sandals for a casual day."
4.0,Nice boots but be aware the lining does not come out which is a hassle when trying to dry the inside of the boots.  Also they do Tunstall sized so I ordered a  halftime bigger and they are fine.
4.0,"It was a gift. The service was great, very timely. I will be thinking about what I might want for myself. I love stones and crystals, this felt a bit too heavy for me to wear as I have neck issues but it wouldn't deter me. My friend loved it. Her son is autistic and it's a great communication stone."
4.0,Takes a bit of getting used to.  Holds up your socks pretty well.  In hindsight I would have purchased the ones that are separate so that I could place them where I wanted to and be a bit more comfortable.
4.0,"sizing a bit confusing- turns out the 16.9 neck tag reads 43 neck & fits like a L. (slight) ribbed fabric, not a line pattern. the light blue is a nice color, slightly darker than pictured, chose it over another band's. bought this in black too because it's priced so well, & wish there were more dark colors-had to choose another brand for navy, burgundy & teal- [[ASIN:B07921TNS1 INFLATION Mens Bamboo Fiber Dress Shirts Slim Fit Short Sleeve Casual Button Down Shirts, Elastic Formal Shirts, Deep Blue, US Size L (Tag43)]]"
4.0,They are decent but not Dearfoams by far. I normally wear 5-6 but the smallest was 6-7. I have a little extra length at the back.  They were delivered fast and that made me happy.
4.0,They have an extra piece is the back that gave my son a blister.  Hoping wearing then around the house will work
4.0,"So far this band has been very good. It looks very nice and fits my wrist well. I use the blaze original Large size band.  It's a good product for the price, I have had it for nearly a month and it still holding up well. It feels like it's built well but it doesn't seem very resistant either. Be careful with it,  as long as you're not  constantly pulling on it, you should be fine. The color looks just like in the picure and is what one would expect."
4.0,"Really dig the costume so did many others at this Halloween Rave I went to in Seattle... Good times... that being said... I am 5'4 benching above 200 so my chest is a bit larger for my size and man oh man this top part of the suit is super tight and a bit uncomfortable in the armpits... The mask couldve been done a little better too but for the price I feel you get a pretty nice costume... Next time I will order a size up though, because if you are like me then you must also be super flexible like me to get this on and even getting this on by myself was a struggle."
4.0,"Thin material, but thick enough that your nipples won't show through. Comfortable. Great for the price."
4.0,"They look pretty, but my daughter lost one already within a week from purchase day!"
4.0,It looks great on a wall or if you are ready to cosplay or Halloween party. Lightweight an yet sturdy an authentic looking like captain America
4.0,"It is so adorable and nice quality. The actual bow/feathers part is loose so you can move it to the place you want it, but it was a bit too loose and kept falling down to my ear. But that's nothing a little glue can't fix."
4.0,"I ordered the small and it fits fairly big on me and I am 21 weeks pregnant, 5'2"" at 132 lbs. I would recommend going for a size smaller if you can, I understand that it is meant to be a loose fit, but it is a bit too loose. I wouldn't recommend for small petite women unless you like very loose fitting clothes."
4.0,To be determined
4.0,"I absolutely love these pants! They are comfortable, versatile, and go with everything. I wear them at least twice a week. I would wear them more often but then people would think I was weird. My only complaint is that they are not quite as Flowey as I expected, the fabric could have a bit more drape to it, but other than that they are just perfect."
4.0,Love the size. Wish it was yellow gold.
4.0,I love the look and feel of this shirt but the fit is smaller than expected.  I would order a size up if you don't want a tight fit.
4.0,Shorts are great except for the fact that they’re unraveling in odd spaces.  Worn a good month and then they started to unravel.
4.0,Well made shirt medium weight fabric
4.0,"Ok, I really like Skagen watches.  They are always minimalistic and classy looking.<br /><br />When I first saw this watch I fell in love with it immediately.  The only thing I didn't like about it was how thick it was.  Most Skagen watches are very thin, which is super nice.  This watch is about twice as thick as any others, for the extra large battery I presume.<br /><br />As with any tech item, a hybrid smart watch is only as good as its software.  The Skagen Connected software is very similar to other watch softwares I've tried (like the Anne Klein hybrid smartwatch).  The watch can be used to control music, snap a picture with your phone camera (if it were on a tripod), and tell you who is calling on your phone.  In other regards, its like a generic activity tracker that can tell you how much you sleep, walk, and whatever.  Which is not a very big deal there are a million devices out there that do some of those things, including your phone.<br /><br />Normally hybrid smart watches don't do it for me. but the ability to know who is trying to contact me is pretty useful. I leave my phone in my pocket most of the time, and being able to see who is calling by glancing at my wrist is really a big deal.<br /><br />I like the classic looks, it is way nicer to wear this in a meeting than an iwatch.  If you look at your iWatch during a meeting some people already think they are losing you, but the hybrid gives you much more privacy.  Nobody knows someone just texted me.<br /><br />So I would give the watch 5 stars, but I remove a star because I'm just not feelin' it."
4.0,"Fits nicely, super cozy. The reason I'm giving it 4 starts is because when it arrived there was a large hole on the side. Luckily it was an easy fix."
4.0,"Very cute and comfortable sleeping on but very hard to bend back to original state. I did follow bending instructions but you can still see the bend in the metal. however, would buy again."
4.0,"Would have liked these to feel more like natural fibers, has that slight polyester feel to it. Good color and fit otherwise"
4.0,IT'S BEAUTIFUL!  I LOVE IT!  IT'S A LITTLE HARD TO WEAR FOR ME.  I BOUGHT A LARGE AND I AM 5' 11 SIZE 6 - 8.  I TYPICALLY WEAR A MEDIUM  ITS  TIGHT IN MY SHOULDERS.  IF YOUR LOOKING TO BUY DEFIANTELY A SIZE UP THAN YOU WHAT YOU TYPICALLY WEAR.
4.0,A bit larger than I thought they'd be but they look and feel great. I wear them around the house when I'm chillaxin.
4.0,"Am a size 41 in Europe, orderd a size 11.. Should have orderd a size 10"
4.0,"This is the second pair of these gloves I have ordered. The first were a Christmas present for a relative.  While I was snowshoeing one day I had to borrow them. They are comfortable and water resistant, but not as cold resistant as advertised. The weather the day I wore them was at zero (no where near -30° as advertised) and my fingers were really cold after about 20 minutes. Overall though they work nice for milder temps, (above 10° seems to be ok) so I got myself a pair."
4.0,"Super cute, just as pictured. It was bigger then i expected and will be perfect for my daughter to wear with a sweater!"
4.0,Served it's purpose of a costume prop!
4.0,Nice ok for the money
4.0,All I know is it fit perfectly and my granddaughter LOVES it!
4.0,Love the look of this purse! It went well with my shoes.  The only draw back is that it easily snags other materials.
4.0,Material feels good. Might be a little see threw.
4.0,The material is a little heavier than I was expecting but it looks great on. I wish I would have ordered a few different colors. This will be great for travel no wrinkles.
4.0,"Comfortable, fits perfectly, and friends liked it a lot."
4.0,"the shoulders are bit weird though, maybe because i'm a woman and the shirt's fitted for a guy?"
4.0,"It's very cute, just as pictured and a good length on a taller frame. I'm 5'9&#34; and it goes nearly to my knees. Hard to find dresses that fit my body and are of a comfortable length as well. This one was good.<br /><br />However, the seams are not very strong. I got this to wear for halloween so I wouldn't risk ruining my nice dirndl (actually from Germany), and it was good for the night, but already looks worn out. Don't expect Germany-quality craftsmanship if you only want to shell out $60 or so for a dirndl; they're quality pieces and you almost always get what you pay for."
4.0,They arrived early.  They are tighter than I thought they would be but I like them.
4.0,Well constructed this looked beautiful at my friends wedding.  The length is a little on the long side which brushed the top of my shoes perfectly.  The way it comes in at the waist is very flattering.  I love the deep green color and the lacy back.  The lining makes the skirt opaque
4.0,"I like the zippered coverup tunic.  It is comfortable and lightweight.  I was surprised by the pockets though.  There are  2 zippered pockets on the outside, and 2 unsecured pockets on the inside (under the zippered pocket).  The velcro flaps seem to be decorative only as these are not pockets.  Would consider buying again if more colors were added."
4.0,They are cute. Look more-so for a kid than adult. Will being giving them away as a Christmas gift.
4.0,This shirt is short. It looks good with my high waisted leggings but is definitely not long and flowy as I was hoping
4.0,"This is a beautiful swimsuit and fits me well, except for being slightly snug on my chest. My only issue is there was stitching that was coming apart on the back when I opened the swimsuit, something I'll end up fixing myself."
4.0,Delivered on time. Shoes look great I really love them. No problems with the product but the box was pretty much destroyed when I opened it and the original tag was torn off the shoe which was a little dissappointing because I always keep them when I buy new pairs of vans. But other than that everything is perfect.
4.0,Love. Love. Love. It's wide-rimmed. It keeps its shape... Even in the pool. It protected me from the African sun.<br /><br />To the reviewers who complained about the wind... This hat is wide-rimmed. Anything with &#34;wings&#34; is going to fly.<br /><br />I docked one star for price and lack of color selection.
4.0,It is beautiful! But run small in the sleeves !
4.0,Great product! Pink ones are a bit see through if you wear darker shade underwear.
4.0,Updated from earlier review!<br /><br />The surface of this belt did not look new. Kind of distressed. But the quality and sturdiness is very good. Solid leather o have a black one also and they are long lasting belts.
4.0,Costume jewelry cute but tarnished pretty quickly. It was very hard to take off because it's fastener is tiny so I left it on but didn't hold up...😟
4.0,"Son loves these classes.  They fit pretty big on the face, had to keep adjusting them."
4.0,"Very pretty, the quality of the petals is great. The rose gold is beautiful but will tarnish if gets wet."
4.0,Nice shirt but a bit snugger than expected
4.0,"I like these socks, what you see is what you get"
4.0,"The necklace part could of been a bit better, a little bit of a snag to put on if you never wore a necklace before. But the ring is cool and it fit well."
4.0,"the buckles look nice. they do not look the strongest, time will tell how long they and the finishing will last.<br />the design is cute and the buckle was surprisingly not too difficult to install. it comes with extra pins. appreciate that, as some sellers skimp and the pins are easy to break or loose. wish it also came with a tool to install the buckle, but for the price cannot complain."
4.0,"Updated review:  Mine cracked when I was cleaning it with the cloth, next to the right clip line. They are still together - but it's a visible crack.  I'll keep wearing it until it falls apart, but the description of ""won't break"" is not accurate.<br /><br />They fit great.  I read the measurements - which you need to do - and they worked perfect for me.  Easy on and off. They are not flip. The ones I looked at that flipped just seemed too bulky in the middle.  I don't see the clip at all on these when I'm wearing them.  They do pick up oils easily - don't necessarily see that looking through, but when looking at them, you can.  I just give them a wipe before wearing.  Easy peasy."
4.0,"The cuffs do not extend down the wrist as much as you see in the photos. Otherwise, fine."
4.0,Great umbrella just showed up one day too late and couldnt use it for my needs.
4.0,"I love how easy this piercing is to put in and the quality is amazing for only $10. The size (diameter, seems like 10cm) was bigger than expected but I still love the way it looks!"
4.0,Medium fitted my 5&#34;2 and 36×33×40 frame perfectly. Note that it is on the short side though.
4.0,"For a cheap (currently $9.95) pair of sunglasses, I never expected more than a few months of wearing time.  I rarely spend more than ten or fifteen dollars on sunglasses, basically treating them as dispensable.  However, going on 6 months, these glasses are still holding together well.  Hinges have not loosened up yet--fingers crossed!  When these die, I'll probably buy another pair.<br /><br />***<br />Now I know the exact lifespan of these glasses:  six months.  Soon after writing the above review, the hinges on the sunglasses began to weaken.  I was able to wear them only once or twice more before throwing them away."
4.0,"We are planning a beach vacation and ordered these sunglasses. They arrived only protected by a bubble envelope, but don’t appear to have any damage or wear.<br /><br />They are probably a little too “square” for me, but my wife loves them.<br /><br />They are “gradient“ shaded and the frame is a stylish design."
4.0,"I liked the watch,but the online picture was not what the watch color was when i received it."
4.0,This swimsuit was a great buy! The top was a little small but great product overall.
4.0,They are very cute but very large. It was at least one size larger than expected.
4.0,"Fit pretty good, I had it for my baby shower.<br />I wasn’t impressed with the material but otherwise it’s a pretty dress"
4.0,"These underwear appear well constructed and seemed consistent between the different colors.  The fabric is a decent weight - not too thick, not too thin.  The crotch is lined and sewed down on the ends, which I was surprised to see at this price.  The side seams are not sewed down.  The elastic at the waist and legs is flat with some width to it, which I think is better for minimizing panty lines.  The cut is typical for a modern hipster - a lower rise in the front with full coverage in the back.  The sizing is generous for sure and does follow US sizing.  I'm usually on the low end of a size 6 for Jockey, so that's what I ordered for these.  The leg openings were a bit large, so you may want to size down if you are on the low end of your size.  The description says they are cut a little larger to allow for shrinkage, but I would not expect the elastic of the leg openings to shrink.<br /><br />I returned them because I have sensitive skin and need the side seams sewed down to avoid irritation.  So I can't speak to how these wash up and how much they shrink.  But if the side seams are not an issue for you, I think these are certainly worth a try.  They seems to be a good value."
4.0,They are nice with big pockets but they run small I'm a 40 waist and I had to get a 3xl but they are perfect for me for work I work inside ups loading packages and its extremely hot in the in the summer so these are perfect for me
4.0,"They fit nicely on my face. The parts that go over the ears are easy to bend to fit your ears so they don't slip off of your face. They're light-weight, nicely sized (at least for me), and very sturdy. The lenses are a bit difficult to clean, but I've found a way to manage. They don't hurt to wear, I didn't have to do much of anything to get used to them. All in all, a great set of fake glasses.<br /><br />Edit: They actually broke now today. One of the ear pieces broke off. It wasn't at the screw, but instead it broke off the part that was attached to the screw (if that makes sense?). It was bound to happen, with the amount I accidently sat on them, but it's still unfortunate."
4.0,Love this band - Looks/wears great.  Only grip is how stiff/rigid the band is.  Its been about a week and the band is still pretty rigid
4.0,"Warm and soft, just like waffles."
4.0,"The belt is ok. Thinner than I expected, which is nice. However, the material of the belt and the metal are a bit thin and on the cheaper looking side. Good to wear a few times to enhance some outfits."
4.0,"Leather band is as described, and fit easily onto my Charge 2.  I am a bit worried because the band is quite thin, I wonder how long it lasts because I take my Fitbit off every night.  The last leather band I had was quite thicker, and lasted only 1 1/2 years."
4.0,"Beautiful, but expect the pearl to hang very low on the chest (not as pictured)."
4.0,Love the material but the size cane a little bit bigger than expected. It says slim fit but fit as a regular. I would suggest getting a size smaller.
4.0,I love the fabric and the pattern. No complaints.
4.0,"I love these sandals! And unfortunately they do not make these anymore. I like the thong style but needed greater management so that my foot did not step off the side as it tends to do in regular flip flops. These sandals provided that extra stability without being confining. The only down side to them is that the elastic stretches out and when it brakes, the sandal cannot be worn."
4.0,Good quality. Just slightly small.
4.0,"Perfect gift for a 4 year old boy, he loves them and they come with a case. Great buy"
4.0,Was expecting it to be a little darker but other than that it’s a nice hoodie.
4.0,Beautiful shirt for such a great price!
4.0,I read the other reviews about the fabric being thin and sheer and it’s true. I bought it to use as a swim coverup and that is what I’m going to use it for. Not confident in how long it will last since the fabric is thin but thought it was worth a try.
4.0,They are a thinner material which is great for warmer weather. They did run long in the length.
4.0,Bought this for a Velma (from the Scooby gang) Halloween costume. It's very comfortable and the size was a little bigger than I expected.
4.0,Great light jacket to have on me all the time
4.0,"So, it’s a little big - but not anything I couldn’t work with. The print is FANTASTIC. It’s unique and I adore it. The fabric is thin, but if it were printed on any other fabric it wouldn’t look right. It’s beautiful and I would absolutely buy it again."
4.0,Good sweats!
4.0,"A lot longer than I expected, but gets the job done."
4.0,"Bought it for my self and my kids. We all love it. Warm where it needs to be, and cool enough for hands to breathe."
4.0,"I ordered these amazing socks as a gift for my son, who wears a size 12 and was looking for socks like these for treks in Alaska. Anyways he was home when they arrived and was worried about them possibly shrinking upon washing. So my husband who wears a 10 1/2'decided he liked and would wear them. That being said, they are really well made socks with a great feel, but they do run slightly small. Great socks for the money when you compare them to the department store brands.<br />I am an Amazon reviewer and my job is to honestly evaluate and recommend products as described. The reason for the 4 star rating is the size selection is best suited for 9-11 size men's."
4.0,Nice size and like accordion style inside
4.0,"The unicorn slippers were adorable and the make of them was fine.  However, the toes seemed a bit snug fitting on the top of the foot which was uncomfortable and made it slightly awkward to get on. May need to try a different size."
4.0,Super cute great deal
4.0,Very comfy! Lost one star because the color is either wrong or not like the photo. I ordered Navy and it looks like the ocean blue. I don't hate it so I'm keeping it but I wish it was Navy.
4.0,"I've been looking on and off for some chaps that are little more stylish, and these do fit the bill. I have yet to wear them while riding, I'm not sure how insulating they're going to be. They aren't quite as thick as my current chaps, but I think they will do OK. If I remember, I'll add a comment to this review once I get a chance to try them out.<br /><br />There were a lot of comments about having problems with choosing the right size. Tip: be sure to measure your thigh wearing the pants that you would wear while riding. I initially took my measurements wearing sweatpants - 23 inches. I also followed the advice  of the other reviews  and went up a size or two.  They were way too big.  I remeasured myself wearing jeans - 21 inches.  I returned the first pair, and ordered a smaller size following the chart that's provided. Worked like a charm.<br /><br />I also saw reviews indicated that the side laces were just for show and did not affect the fit.  I found that loosening and tightening the laces gave me about quarter to a half inch of play. Just enough that I could tighten them around the thigh area and loosen them a bit in the calves.  Once I got them just right, I tied them off at the top and used the zipper to put them on. There will be some play, and I know that they will stretch in time. For now though, they fit in all the right places.<br /><br />Last comment goes out to Milwaukee Leather.  I'm not sure why somebody felt it was necessary to include laces that were 13.5 FEET LONG (see photo).  Not only was it wasteful, but it was a HUGE pain in the behind unlacing them and relacing them.  After several attempts  to use the laces as they were, I finally gave up and cut the laces in half.  I did the best I could to fix the end that I cut (as it immediately frayed). Doesn't look great, not super happy about it, but I can deal.  Please do your customers a favor, use the proper size laces with the product.<br /><br />4-19-21 UPDATE<br /><br />Loving my chaps so far! Can't say as I have any complaints other than the laces thing (considering ordering a new set for them).  They fit well; I was worried about them sagging down without something holding them in place . . . not a problem. They are a breeze taking them on and off (no more fumbling around with buckles and belts when using the loo 😋, ladies - you know what I'm talking about!).  They are just as tough as my previous chaps, and take up WAY less space in my saddlebags (huge plus there).  I've gotten LOTS of compliments on them as well.  One the best bike gear purchases I've ever made. Highly recommend"
4.0,"Beautiful dress when it's on, just wish the top strap was adjustable."
4.0,"I received many compliments about this dress. I purchased a large thinking it was a true large size(12-14) but after reading the product description I realized that the large was actually a size 8-10 so I had to reorder the extra large. The material is nice and soft but I noticed that after I took the outfit off the neckline had little tears around it, somewhat disappointed because I really like this outfit."
4.0,"I really love the quality of these pants, they fit well everywhere!"
4.0,"This is adorable and I thought I ordered a larger size because my grand daughter like it to fit loosely, however it does not fit loosely but the quality of this robe is great."
4.0,"This is a very nice mask, but it was a little uncomfortable for my husband. He is 6'2&#34; and 200 pounds, and the mask didn't fit his face well. It would be well worth the purchase, if you were looking for a nice Phantom mask"
4.0,Perfect so beautiful 😍
4.0,Turns your crappy plastic band looking gear s2 into a nicely well maded black stanless steel techie watch.  I mean seriously 300 dollar watch and you get such a crappy band.  For those of us in the business sector or who like to look nice khakis button up shirts etc.  You can have a 300 dollar eye sore that looks like it cost a fraction of that.  This band alone adds nice value looks good and it means you can probably wear it to more formal activities.
4.0,"Happy and Proud to show my support. Wish it was a little larger.<br /><br />However, quality product."
4.0,"This lounger is perfect for wearing around the house, and to bed as a nightgown. It is the right length for me, has sleeves to keep my upper arms warm at night, and is roomy. The stitching is holding up well. Fabric is sufficiently sturdy. My only gripe is the slash pockets because they're awkward, and I'd much prefer front patch pockets."
4.0,Nice product  easy to use  well made
4.0,These are nice but one tore up on the first wear. But it was an easy fix.
4.0,"Really lovely dress, I've only worn to try on so far but I really loved the way it fit my body. Very sexy but not over the top. Saving it for date night :)"
4.0,Nice Comfortable and the perfect length. Not very flattering but its easy to throw and head to the mall or run errands.
4.0,I love this dress mine came in to big so I had to return
4.0,"This pendant is just as pictured. it is a pretty heavy weight and the way it attaches to the chain seems sturdy. For a basic gold accent necklace/long necklace, it does a good job."
4.0,Just what I was looking for to make my daughter's halloween costume.
4.0,"Good item. Like the first one so I got it into more colors. Soft, with pockets, and able to wear with leggings. Yay!"
4.0,Cord was a little stiff when first arrived. Wore in the shower a few times and it softened up alot. Very simple design came in a nice canvas bag
4.0,WILL BE GOOD THIS WINTER.
4.0,So cute I ordered the black and the pink and I ordered XL and they were still alittle tight because I have 36DDD  and I'm 5'5&#34; and I weigh 165 lbs but whatever still cute!!
4.0,"This 18K Gold Plated Hypoallergenic Stud Earrings on the White color are so beautiful unfortunately mine came with a crack on the white material.<br />The packaging in my opinion may be to blame because the earrings didn’t have anything at all for protecting the earrings like padding or such…<br />The item description states that this earrings are 18kt gold plated, it doesn't fade or rust, Hypoallergenic, nickel-free and lead-free and  Safe for Skin.<br />The design is so pretty and the color as well. They look elegant and the white material looks like mother of pearl…<br />The size was perfect for my style."
4.0,"LOVE, love, love the print, the style of the dress but material and workmanship is just ok. I'm 5'4&#34;, 114 lbs and size 4 is pretty snug.For the price,<br />I was truly expecting this dress to be better. I have ordered other  similar dresses but different brands from Amazon, paid almost half the price for the same workmanship and material."
4.0,It’s pretty good. Sometimes it gets loose easy though.
4.0,I had to order one size smaller.
4.0,Very nice looks just like what was advertised I’m happy with my purchase
4.0,The material is thin and the dress feels a little cheap. I like the fit and the pattern still. I'm not sure if it is work place quality.
4.0,"Good material well padded for biking, looks funny if just wearing to walk around in. But for biking a must to protect your bottom!<br />I would recommend for anyone using a a bike of any sort for exercise."
4.0,The sunglasses are well made but they didn't cover enough if my vision area to be able to wear them. Returning.
4.0,Good I like!!!
4.0,Aside from the fact that it was in busted-ass packaging without instructions...I love the watch and it looks new.
4.0,Fun stuff for me.
4.0,Nice feel and love wearing it around the house.
4.0,"bought for my girlfriend. Super cute and subtle bell. Could wear anytime, has great adjustment range for all sizes."
4.0,"Decent product, especially for the price."
4.0,I love these!! The only drawback for these is its a little hard to get your feet in but a few tugs and viola! The color is as pictured.
4.0,Runs big.  Super cute though.
4.0,Love the way it looks and feels.  Can wait to where it when the gym reopens next week!
4.0,i like the clasp
4.0,Kid happy.
4.0,Plastic is very thin at seams so don't load bag too much or it will split out like ours did
4.0,"Perfect for my grad, does fit a Pandora snake chain. I gifted it with Pandora's 2018 scroll bead & she loved it!"
4.0,Love it but breaks easy
4.0,"This shirt is a great weight but a bit on the small side.  Although it fits, it is very snug."
4.0,Paint is awesome.  Can is sealed so gad to puncture it to use the paint.  Hence 4 stars
4.0,I bought a nice Spidel money clip to go over this minimalist wallet which worked out really well.  I wish it was just a little thicker to fit 2-3 more cards.  It’s a little tight pulling my cards out.  That should go away as wallet is broken in but I can’t carry all my cards inside it at this moment.  I am on lookout for slightly bigger wallet part.  The two items go well together.  I know a few other men who are looking for same combo.  Maybe you should go back to selling both the wallet and clip together again? You used to.  That’s where I bought my previous wallet and clip.
4.0,"Beautiful, but fits adult head better"
4.0,"I really love this, but couldn’t imagine this fitting well on someone with a large chest! I have a very small chest and ordered a large to make sure it wasn’t to tight and it does fit smaller than expected. It’s super cute and comfortable though!"
4.0,Their ok just
4.0,"This was a wonderful party pack. The sunglasses made for great party favors and the packet came with a wonderful personalized note from the business owner. There are exactly 8 plates, cups, etc...so you'll definitely need to buy more utensils, plates,etc. A great product that met expectations."
4.0,The big jewel turns and feels less secure than other belly button rings I’ve had but it’s way cuter than others. The purple is gorgeous.
4.0,Very comfortable and I get compliments every time I wear them.  Great colors.
4.0,Perfect for Sunday brunch or shopping.  I wore it with flat sandals and then switched to a wedge. Looked great both ways. You will need a cute bralette or something with thin straps if you worry about niplage.  It isn’t see through but without a bra might be a little extra.  It is a low cut “v” so a bandeaux won’t work (in my opinion).  I haven’t washed it yet so I didn’t want to give it five stars.  I am a healthy size 8 with a D cup.
4.0,A little short for pants
4.0,Gloves are very comfortable and so not feel heavy nor hot. Would of liked a little more passing but they do a good job .
4.0,"Feels like underwear, but def works for swimming"
4.0,"Little unravelly at the bottom, but I’d buy again!"
4.0,"I for one read EVERY review before I buy something. Sometimes it's hard to tell if they are real, honest reviews, or if they are paid or fake generated reviews. This is my honest review.<br />I like it, however the brand name is printed right on the front of the wallet and its terribly ugly. Does the job though."
4.0,Great<br />Very happy<br />Nice quality
4.0,"This product is very comfortable to travel in. It washed well the first time. There was no shrinkage; however, it runs small. I ordered an XL because I need more room in the top. The top fit like a Large and the pants did as well. Other than that The product served the purpose for which it was ordered."
4.0,Stitching on back was a bit off...but overall good!
4.0,"It runs a little big I think, but I really love the feel of the material and it fits really nice and lays nicely against your body. Overall I was really pleased with this and I don't usually purchase clothing over the internet as it's hard to find clothes that fit my &#34;not normal sized/standard sized&#34; body, lol! But this is great. I received this at a discount for my honest and unbiased review"
4.0,Don’t reduce swelling as much but do provide comfort for all day wear
4.0,"I really liked the look of this online, but once I got it, it was basically a sticker on a mirrored plate. I think it was still decent quality.. which is why I gave it 4 stars. Sadly, I returned as I didn't think it would last long term."
4.0,Lost my school pin. This makes a good replacement
4.0,I love the color and feel of the fabric. It’s keeping me warm without the bulk of a sweatshirt.
4.0,"Daughter decided on Wednesday night at 9 pm that she wanted to go to the homecoming dance on Saturday night. Mom had an instant panic attack because daughter did not have a dress and there would be no opportunity to shop for one before the dance in two and a half days!! Daughter says not to worry, she will order one online! Mom freaks out because WILL IT FIT??!!! Daughter looks on Amazon, finds this dress, uses the sewing kit tape measure to get her measurements and compares those with the measurements listed on the size chart and orders her size. Thankfully, the dress was on PRIME (!!) so we got two day shipping. It arrived at 2 pm on Saturday and fit perfect! Mom was so relieved and daughter was very happy! She looked beautiful for her first dance!<br />For a $41.99 dress, the quality was good, better than I expected. I am sure that we would have paid twice that amount in a department store.<br />The only complaint that I have about the dress (which is why it got 4 stars instead of 5) was the color. The sample color (B-wine Red) looks darker and deeper, more of a maroon color closer to purple. The dress was definitely closer to a true red."
4.0,Is a cute and great dress :)
4.0,They were tighter than I thought.
4.0,The feel of these is like lularoe. I have washed and dried it twice and there are no lint balls on it. Dust and hair doesn't collect on it like other cheap leggings. Very very comfortable but I do wish it had waist control. I am a size 12 and the OS fits well. I would buy these again if it had waist control.
4.0,"I got this as kind of a toss in gift for my husband at Christmas, and it turned out to be his favorite thing! He said the sound quality for music is great, people near him couldn't hear it, and the hat is warm. He said it wasn't great for taking calls. But a fantastic gift, especially for the price."
4.0,Loved the dress. Be careful when wearing seams are not sewn well. The back of my dress ripped after 3 or 4 wears. But great deal for the price and light weight on
4.0,"The sizing seems accurate. I am usually a medium, and the medium fits. I have an athletic body type with muscular legs. My legs are much thicker than the model's, so as I expected, the fit is not baggy like the picture. As for the butt... I do not have a big butt. But the back of these shorts is very small. I don't think sizing up would have solved the problem, these shorts fit very well in most ways and are not tight, it's just that I can't pull them up to a normal height in the back. I have not had this problem with other shorts. So DO NOT get them if you have a big butt, they will not fit. Since I have a medium-sized butt and the shorts are comfortable and look good and cover my crack, I am keeping them. PS I took out the stitches tacking the hem up, because I wanted them to be an inch longer and look like cutoffs. It worked out as expected. They look like a shorter version of men's shorts and they are pretty flattering. Also I washed them in warm water and dried them in warm air and they didn't shrink, or maybe they shrunk a tiny bit but stretched out again after a few minutes."
4.0,"Beautiful fabric and looked wonderful on the hanger. I sized up based on the measurements given because I am small but busty (34H/32HH), with a longer torso for my someone my height. I completely lost all the length of the shirt in my bust, which is a real bummer, because it doesn’t work as a midriff bearing top on me either. Back it goes."
4.0,"I sit, a LOT for work, so I purchase quite a few compression socks. I liked the look and price of these so purchased a pack of their large/x large since I wear a size 10.5 shoe. They do seem to be nice quality but ended up being far too short only making it half way up my calf so keep that in mind when ordering. The shipping and return were very quick as always with Amazon."
4.0,"You may probably have already guessed from the picture; but, yes, the 3 bar shaped earrings are ordinary earrings and not magnetic.<br /><br />Otherwise, the order is as expected. I think most of the magnetic earrings on Amazon come from the same Chinese manufacturer so I don't think there is much uniquely to be said about these."
4.0,Cute. I like it.Its cheap made but for the price I expected that when I ordered it. I still wear it and like it. Pretty fast shipping also.
4.0,I'm only giving it 4 stars because I had to tighten the screws for the ear pieces. Other than that I love them. They look great and I've received several compliments about them.
4.0,Love it but it does run big
4.0,"I am &#34;short waisted&#34; so I was excited to see a product that was aimed at people like myself. It's a pretty good product, but there are a few flaws that make it interesting to use.<br />Pros:<br />- looks exactly like the picture<br />- arrived nicely packaged and earlier than expected<br />- it's very sturdy and feels like it will do it's intended job very well<br />- it's a great length and I don't have anything hanging way down my sides looking silly.<br /><br />Cons:<br /> - It smells a little bit funky. It aired out ok, but it took a couple days.<br /> - The size is off a little bit. It runs about a size smaller than expected.<br /> - It's hard to get on. The hooks are embedded in the rubber which makes them hard to do up. On the plus side, there is no way this thing is going to pop open on accident. ;)<br /><br />I was lucky enough to receive this waist trainer at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion. Honestly, I think that the length is awesome and that the construction is great. The smell was a little bit off putting at first, but it faded. The sizing is a bit of a pain but not a deal breaker. I like it and I'll probably use it fairly often, I just wish it was a bit easier to get into. :)"
4.0,"I bought large but I am medium, it fits good!"
4.0,The slit in the front is much bigger than I would have thought
4.0,"I accidentally ordered it when I ordered one for my other granddaughter, it didn't come for Halloween but I loved the first one so much we decided to keep the other one for next year! It is absolutely adorable, well made, and beautiful, well worth the price!"
4.0,"I really like the bag. It is made well, trendy and serves all my purposes. However, I was a bit displeased with the inside size of it. I thought it was big enough to be able to put something the size of a legal pad down in it, but that's not the case. Overall, I give it a 4 star rating for that one flaw."
4.0,"This is my 3rd watch winder - my wife gave me a lovely Steinhausen burled elm winder which was expensive but had a crap motor which only lasted 2 years.  Frustrated, I replaced that with an el cheapo Diplomat plastic horror which lasted slightly longer but gave up the ghost a few weeks ago.  It was so noisy, we kept it in the master closet.  I browsed Amazon for a mid-range winder focusing on better internals - I found it here.  I hope that the Japanese motor delivers but I have to say - this is a beautiful box.  The quality is more than the price suggests and it is so quiet, it's back on my side table where it belongs.  Happy."
4.0,"Very cute sunglasses , the mirrored lenses are a little darker than shown in the picture , I was a little disappointed at first , but they look REALLY good on , so no big deal. I'm picky how sunglasses fit on me , so that's the reason I took one star away , they sit a bit wobbly when wearing them and the actual darker colored lens than dipicted . These came with a really cute case to store them in."
4.0,"This watch does exactly what the add says it will do.  I downloaded the app to my phone, pushed the button on the watch and BOOM it synced up and set the time.<br /><br />I tried setting three alarms.  All worked without issue.<br />I set the chime.  This worked as well.<br /><br />Pushing the top button once - announces the time,<br />Pushing the top button twice - announces the date.<br />Pushing the top button three times - announces the month and year.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />The voice takes a little bit to get used to.<br />Not sure why the second button push just doesn't go ahead and announce the full date (day,month,year).<br />This one is subjective:  To me a watch is also a bit of jewelry. This watch while completely functional is not the most attractive in this regard. Not exactly toy like but not jewelry like as well.<br /><br />All in all it does what it says it does, the numbers are large, and I'm a big fan of the analog dial."
4.0,"It was surprising to find that this wallet would be shipped from China with an expected arrival from about a month to two months after placing the order.  It came several weeks later.  It is larger than a regular long fold wallet, giving plenty of room. This could make it more enticing to pick pockets. However it fits in pockets OK. It is a bit stiff but seems to be loosening up. I'm pleased with it, overall."
4.0,"I love this hoodie, the only flaw tight around the arms. I am 5'9 200 pounds, but the rest is great, will be ordering in other colors"
4.0,It’s a little snack but I still wear it it’s very pretty
4.0,The bunny was really soft. The size was extremely small. No where near 6inches.  I've gotten another from same company but different color and it was 6.5 inches Tall. Guess it could be certain colors are bigger than others.  Should have been 6in but is more like 4.
4.0,Super cute cotton dress.<br />I sized up for a baby-doll look so<br />It’s kind of boxy but I find it cute and comfy and the ruffle on the sleeves dresses it up just enough for work.
4.0,"I love my hoodie, although I had to order it 2-3 sizes up. Material has a nice flop to it and you're bound to get some compliments. I wear a US women's size small and I order an XL which gave me a more looser fit."
4.0,Nice design. They can be easily adjusted for lanyard or sports use. The adjuster does not lock in place but also does not slip too easily when the lines are spread apart so should work fine. Only time will tell how well they work and how long they will last.
4.0,I was looking for an easy slipper to put on that I would not have to grip when I walked. These are snug little booties that have a cushioned soul. They were just what I was looking for.
4.0,"The fit was not flattering on me, but the dress was great!"
4.0,Got this but have to say the color is off. Its a lighter blue as in pictures
4.0,"Very pretty, sturdy chain, this is the second necklace I’ve bought from this “TIDOO” brand and I love it."
4.0,The hoodie looks good and wears well.
4.0,"Great little dress. Fits great, won't wrinkle and I've only washed it once but it came out of the dryer ready to wear again. The material is light weight and great for summer."
4.0,Looks good.  Does the job
4.0,"Very cute top, but thin material. Seems like good workmanship, though. I wash and hang dry."
4.0,"The hat is cute and the design isn't blurry, it's a bit big even tho it's adjustable there is a lot of room on the top. Also it looks more like a baseball cap in the picture but it's more of a flat bill"
4.0,"I'm 5'6, 140 pounds, and a 36D. I usually wear a US medium or I ordered the Asia 175-180, European large, US medium and it fit looser than expected. Didn't have any troubles with the length, like some others. Nice breathable material. Would order again!"
4.0,Used under my disposable masks at work. It does get wet with perspiration if you get warm and then will stick to your face. otherwise it does help for ventilation.
4.0,"Nice, much cheaper price point than the manufacturer of the product."
4.0,Very nice. The necklace doesn't seem to be as shinny as the pendant which bothers me but overall for the price it's a nice piece
4.0,a little large.. but SO cute and quality is good.
4.0,runs big. size down. for reference I am a size 8 normally. ordered medium and is is a tad large.
4.0,"Very clear, but dont fit perfectly in my glasses. Theses are worth getting though"
4.0,I was pleased with the tankini...  it fit as expected and fabric is good quality.  looks exactly like the picture.
4.0,Really like these for work. I work on a computer all day for my job and this helps my eyes immensely. Only complaint is the yellow tint. Wish there was some way to get these minus the yellow tint!<br />They’re really cute though but seem to get kind of dirty easily.
4.0,good quality -nice wide strap
4.0,We had a dress up in your Holiday Attire day at school...this dress was perfect and cost for it perfect
4.0,"Not very thin, I expected thinner. Not 100 percent Cotton, just 80 percent cotton and 20 percent synthetic. Holding stripe is tide and will affect leg muscle."
4.0,Item received I found the fit was a little small so I ordered next size up fit great after washing.
4.0,Really nice dress but runs small.  Had to return the first one to get a larger size.
4.0,"There are really good gauges! However, the bead is a rather difficult to get out. I had to use a pair of pliers to remove them but once that was taken care of I fell in love with them. Good weight, won't fall out of your ears if you leave the beads out like I did! (Weird, I know, haha.) The only reason I gave this four stars instead of five is because of the bead being difficult to remove and pop back in. Honestly though if you're going to wear the earrings with the bead, the metal is flexible enough to gently bend with a pair of pliers and remove it with less trouble than you would have doing it manually. Didn't have any problems with the metal being cheap or turning my ears green either. Overall, a great product. Worth every penny."
4.0,"Would give higher star rating, but the strap that comes along with it is broken. Still wearable, just probably not in public as it is very likely to fall off my chest."
4.0,"Was satisfied with the promptness of delivery. The fanny pack is made well tho I was expecting a lil larger than it was but other than that, I'm satisfied. I cant soeck fir durability since I just recieved it today."
4.0,He is a true Dallas Cowboys fan. Win or Lose!! he is still a die hard fan. loves the slippers
4.0,"I bought the XXL based on the size chart, and I definitely could have gotten away with the XL. That said, as a pregnant woman who's boobs are constantly in a state of distress, these bras are magical. They got me through my first pregnancy, and will get me through this second (LAST) one. I liked the padded inserts at first, but they aren't large enough in the XXL cups. They're moving around too much, so I'll probably take them off. I like that you can comfortable sleep in these bras (and when you're pregnant, most nights you need to sleep in one). And if you wan to exercise in them: wear TWO. If you're between sizes, order DOWN as they run a little larger than I expected. Actually, I'm going to send them back for the XL (Thanks Amazon Prime!), and then my review will be 5 stars!"
4.0,"I love this dress, and bought it for a wedding. I really like how it fits. The only thing I don’t love about it is that the skirt portion is very heavy and reminds me of curtain material."
4.0,Comfortable and good when you need a full underwear.
4.0,My 3 1/2 year old great granddaughter loved them.  She loved the characters and the shirts fit her so cute.  I am pleased with the product.
4.0,I really love the look of the choker and it arrived faster than I thought it would! My only problem is that it is a little tight on my neck.
4.0,"Love the look of this top, and bought it for a tropical vacation along with some other items.  Guess I overlooked the fact that it is 100% polyester, which I do not do well with in a humid environment.  I will keep it because it is well made, and pretty however."
4.0,Very cute top and fits true to size.
4.0,Looks well made. No blemishes. Good price.
4.0,Not for large hands
4.0,thinner material then i expected but nice.
4.0,The top is very nice.  It isn't very flattering lb me....which is why the 4 stars. I think it does run a little big.
4.0,"Not sure if they are supposed to look like they come apart? Nevertheless, they filled a need and my grandson loved them!"
4.0,It fit nice everywhere other than my breast area...the buttons were strugglin just a tad...
4.0,"My two year old loves her glasses.  The frame is very cute and so far, quite durable.  Just wish they came in a smaller size (strap is as tight as it can go), but at least my daughter can grow into them.  For now we're using those ear guards to help prevent them from slipping down her nose."
4.0,It tore my privates up...the stap is badly placed
4.0,so very comfortable
4.0,"A fun accessory, especially for me, an Englishwoman, but I'm not a teenager, so had to lose the silly buttons!  I really like it and it's drawn some amused compliments."
4.0,"These are small, lightweight and perfect for attaching lightweight items to my backpack, eg. my cloth sunglasses case to my backpack."
4.0,If you attend a lot of formal or semiformal events this ensemble is a stunner.
4.0,"I bought this for my son as a work jacket.  It is completely waterproof and it does keep him warm.  The only complaint he has is that the zip pockets are too small.  They barely hold his phone and keys.  He has to maneuver them into the pocket to get them to fit and carefully zip it up.  Aside from that, it's a good jacket."
4.0,The color that I have isn't spot on but I do love the fit of this one. Thanks
4.0,"This was a purchase out of curiosity. A cheap linen shirt for a slim person. I checked the size chart ordered what my measurements where, but as another reviewer said, the arms are really small. If you have big biceps you will not fit in any appropriate size. For me with an athletic build they have just a cm to spare, otherwise a great bargain."
4.0,"The top is pretty, fits well, but the cut of the bottom is very high. Quality is good though."
4.0,"I like this dress for summer. It fits as expected and looks cute. The fabric isn't exactly soft and I don't love the feel of it, but it's nice and thin and breathable which is great for summer. It's not clingy, either, which is great. The color and cut are great and it seems to hold up well."
4.0,I wear a size 8 they barely fit. But really nice!
4.0,Fits true to fit.
4.0,Was very sexy in me...I loved it... Bought medium first . . Didn't fit top too good. . Sent back and ordered a small. Perfect fit.
4.0,"My slippers are very cute and comfortable. They run a little small, so size up."
4.0,"I really love this sweat top, the material feels wonderful, and I really the raccoon in the garbage can! The raccoon is not only on the front but also on the back, which I thought was really awesome.  The only problem is that this sweat top is about a size and a half too small.  2X always fits me but this fits more like a Large.<br />  The decal feels like it is a part of the sweat top and not just something that has been ironed on.  Again the material is very soft, but it is mostly polyester.  It doesn't have that normal cotton sweat shirt feel, but it is still soft.<br />  Because of sizing issues, I can't recommend it even though I like it."
4.0,It is a little shorter than what it looks like in the pictures but it is still great
4.0,"I bought these. I like them a lot. They ripped on my second wear when I brushed up against my fence. Sad... Not really blaming the product, but they are a bit pricey to have ripped so easily.  I still wear them at home with the rip, but sadly cannot wear them out now."
4.0,"I love the color green and the differentials of green. The pair is expectedly long, bold and unique statement pieces. Would definitely recommend to like minded fashionistas like myself."
4.0,"Very pretty bracelet, but it is so tightly woven that is impossible to adjust one handed.  I thought of using my teeth to hold on to one end but decided that the cost of dental work outweighed adjusting the size.  I will wear with pleasure when hubby can pull the ends to adjust to size.  I am not sure what the center piece is supposed to be.  If it is a leopard head I don't see it. Is that just the name???? Anyway, this should be enjoyable to anyone that likes a braided black bracelet with some sort of thing in the middle. :)"
4.0,"I absolutely adore Sock Guy socks and this design is my favorite so far (CephaloPirate!). They fit well, wick moisture, evaporate quickly, and do all the other things you want from an athletic sock. The only reason I can't give them five stars is that they seem to snag a bit easy, but that could just be me being rough on things like I always am."
4.0,These run small and are kind of thin. They are cute though
4.0,Been looking for something to add a little spice to my outfits and this is exactly what I was looking for. The top would probably fit a more fuller chest than mine but wearing it over or under clothes helps it lay right on the body more. Fully adjustable for any body type
4.0,Nice dress. You need to wear a tank top or something under the dress because it's low on the chest area.
4.0,Arms were a little big but I guess that's what you expect from a sweat shirt. It's still a really good fit.
4.0,"I bought the Santa Christmas one, the colors are bright and looks great with a red scarf and black boots.<br />We have done the ugly Christmas sweater thing for years now, this year I wanted to change it up a bit.<br />I am 5'8"" 150 lbs and bought the large because I didnt want a tight fit. Fits just as I expected. Runs true to size<br />I have already washed it and it held up well."
4.0,"I do like these tops but they run a bit big, I ordered a small and it was VERY BIG so I ended up ordering a XS a pack of 3 light weight exactly what I was looking for just wish they made them a little smaller."
4.0,"I am 5 ft and around 135. They look so adorable and flattering on me. I ordered the black, white and red one. For some reason they all fit slightly different. The two $17 ones (black and white) fit perfectly. The red however fit WAY too short. Very low cut but cute with a lace bralette! Soft material. Looks amazing with high waisted leggings and jeans!"
4.0,It’s great holds all cards. My iPhones 8 makes it a bit tight. Overall a 4 star
4.0,"If you are looking for an inexpensive clutch to purchase more for the fun of it, rather than investing in a long-term quality purse, then this little clutch might catch your eye.<br /><br />At $20, it is right in the middle of the price range of $13 to $35 for a glittery, generally rhinestone-covered purse.  At about seven inches long, with a lined interior with no compartments, this clutch is roomy enough to carry essentials (keys, phone, make up, wallet) for a night out.  Given its construction values and materials used, it really is more designed for teens and twenty somethings.<br /><br />The online description is generally correct, except for one glaring hype mistake.  In the sixth advertising slide in its online Amazon product description, the seller says that the short, chunky link chain is ""Luxury metal chain, more refined.""  Wrong.  That chunky link chain pictured there is actually made of cheap, hollow plastic painted with a silver metallic paint to make it look like real metal.  Sorry, vendor, but your description is not correct and should be changed.<br /><br />Comparing apples to apples and feature for feature, this clutch is OK for fun events for a younger demographic.  Our 18-year old is going to use it for a party but the older females who have looked at this clutch say they would not use it for an evening out."
4.0,Sleeves are so big
4.0,"I received this item at a discounted rate in exchange for my unbiased opinion. This lingerie is really comfortable and soft to the touch. I love the flowing style of the top and the overall design.The top was a little small, even though I went by the size chart. I recommend ordering at least one size bigger.  The thong is very pretty, but it was too big. (You always run into that.  Bigger chest doesn't always mean bigger hips! Lol) overall is a very nice product and I would order another one, but maybe changing sizes."
4.0,Cute. A little short for my tall 10-year-old.
4.0,"Lookis beautiful, but not good for walking"
4.0,Super soft! Daughter loves that she and her doll can match! Sizes do run small
4.0,Much larger than expected. I thought this would be something I could wear to work but it’s too fancy for everyday wear. The earrings they sent are different from the ones pictured-the back is different. Makes me wonder if they sent me a different size. It’s still pretty but I won’t be able to wear it as often as I wanted
4.0,"Very pretty, appropriate length - not too long to get in the way"
4.0,"Unless you baby these gloves and don't touch anything, the touch screen rubber will come off fast. First weekend I used them it was already coming off, not to mention that it didn't even work that well.<br /><br />As for the actual glove, it's very nice and the extra warmth of the mitten cover is useful. I'll probably still use these once the touch screen rubber is gone, but I'll wish it was still there."
4.0,"I really liked this dress. The material felt durable and comfortable. The bottom half feels kind of heavy, but the length was great. I am on the shorter side, but with a little heel, it works great"
4.0,Its soft thick and adjustable which is nice
4.0,"It’s a bit tight around the arms, but that may just be me. People complained about the button loops but I don’t see a problem. They are thin/small, but they’re stretchy and because of the elastic waist they don’t need to be done every time you wear it. Overall I think it’s a great deal!"
4.0,This is a good product made with quality material. My only complaint is the back straps are a bit uncomfortable. I’ve decided to go with regular tank top cut shirts instead of this now.
4.0,These are great.  The are light weight and look good on my frames.
4.0,The material is very comfortable and the fit is great! Would absolutely buy again!
4.0,Very pretty blouse! The tissue is ok. a basic blouse
4.0,"I am petite, size 8, 36c. A little tight on top, but it's ok. I think If I gain a few pounds I cannot wear it. I would prefer a bit more room on top."
4.0,The size I ordered was looser than I would like.  I needed an XL and it was not available. Not disappointed in the appearance are the colors very pretty.
4.0,"Nice, comfortable, and great price! I ordered my normal size and I'm about 5 ft and 120 lbs. Not too tight not too loose. Great for layering :) arrived fast too. Good buy!!"
4.0,So this leather jacket I believe is a real genuine leather! It’s so cute and fits great. I wear a L in tops and ordered a L and it fits perfect! It has gold hardware so worth it for the price!
4.0,Fit like a shirt but nice
4.0,Comfortable cotton feel. Fits nice.  A little long for me even with tall wedges.
4.0,"Fits perfectly! I ordered a large and usually wear a size 6. I'm 5'3&#34;, 132lbs, 34B/36A. I was worried the sleeves would be too long but they weren't. I also read reviews that the sleeves snag on a zipper but the long sleeve style does not have a zipper. Has plenty of stretch. The bust area is cut much higher than I'd prefer and hides any chance at cleavage for my small chest. The lace back is beautiful and lets me show off my back without being conscious of all my freckles."
4.0,This was great for a Mardi Gras party! The over all quality and price was excellent. The headband portion needed the ability to tighten without tying like a ribbon.
4.0,"Nice and spacious wallet that holds money, coins, check book and several credit cards. The only thing I do not like is the wording in front of the wallet."
4.0,"Very cute, and my friend loves them. I bought these for myself thinking they were silver but when they arrived they were gold. Gold is not my color so my friend got a very nice present she really enjoyed."
4.0,The dress was great material and what I expected but unfortunately didn't look quite as nice as I was hoping on my body. The buyers were wonderful and refunded me for the dress and the shipping.
4.0,Material is soft and the color is as pictured. I was concerned with the size when ordering but it fits as described.
4.0,It fits a little smaller
4.0,"My son loves it. Only 4 stars because it didn't arrive as soon as I hoped for. Other than arriving after  birthday, we are very pleased."
4.0,My daughter is a size 4.5 so I ordered the size 5-6. She has room to grow but the shoes stay on well. Would definitely recommend.
4.0,"Perfect sizing and the great quality! No loose threads, the underskirt isnt see through and it has the perfect amount of tulle/value. I'm 5'7"" and it comes just above my ankles. Love it"
4.0,Simple and sexy dress!! Great buy for the price!!
4.0,"Good material, good bag.  BUT why why? why SOOOOO Heavy??  OMG !! So heavy.  Yes I understand it has to be rolled, but it is not making sense if I am taking it as a carry on in the flight and more than half of the 11KG allowed on flights is taken by this teeny weeny heavy weight bag.<br /><br />I like it but I don't like it too......"
4.0,beautiful product.  I wish it came larger though
4.0,I really liked the earring design & size was perfect for my daith. However the metal irritated me horrible and I generally have not had issues to metals. I also tried the same earring in my tragus which was an older piercing and that too got highly irritated.
4.0,"Christmas stocking stuffer very very realistic, not cheap looking at all.  Has a spot for I.d. and credit cards."
4.0,"nice design, and the fabric feels smooth and good to the touch, but it is see through in the butt area. i am 5’4”, 118lbs and the small fit perfect (it would fit a taller person much better because there is an inch or two of extra fabric in the length).  however, i am returning the item because of the see through butt area. in my photo, you can see the small white care label in the middle seam area, and my black cheeky underwear.  the solid area of the legging is not black in color as depicted in the stock photo drawing."
4.0,"The quality and fit of the socks are great. The only issue is that the solid color ones a little longer than the printed ones, so if you are short like me (5'4''), then they cut into your knee a little bit."
4.0,"Look cheap,keep away from children eazy damage but it do the job well it ok"
4.0,Decent mask.  I appreciate the message.<br /><br />There is a pocket to insert a filter. It’s on the smaller side for an adult male.  If you talk a lot it slips off the nose.
4.0,i love the hat ..pretty and good quality..
4.0,"This was a good product for it's price. one of the end strings on one necklace fell out, but I can fix that :) Other than that, I liked it. Came right on time!"
4.0,"The dress that is orange is not really orange, but mostly pink. I still like it, but was really looking forward to the orange color!"
4.0,Pretty but sizing off.
4.0,Cute and you can't beat the price.
4.0,"like it overall, but doesn’t really hide the sides if you don’t have a slim waist line."
4.0,Not really a while it's an off white other than that they are pretty
4.0,"I ordered the L/XL mostly because the M/L was unavailable.  Even so, the minimum size on that is 35&#34;.  I have a 39&#34; waist so thought it would be okay.  It's a tad loose and sits more on the top of my hips than my waist.  It isn't a problem as I can easily pin it smaller or do a more permanent alteration on the elastic waistband.  I'm only mentioning it here in case that matters to a potential buyer.  Someone else with a 35&#34;-39&#34; waist may actually WANT it to lay on their hips so it doesn't sit on the waistline and is longer.  The reason I knocked one star off of the rating is that it is NOT made out of netting as the title advertises.  It is organdy like all the other modern ones you find.  I was actually hoping for net because it holds it's shape better.  Still a great deal for the price.<br /><br />When I first received it, I held it upside down and shook it a bit to fluff it out some.  I might try putting it in the dryer on air for a minute to see if that works as well.<br /><br />I am including pictures of it under my new [[ASIN:B01JOIJ3KQ Polka Dots Vintage Pin Up Dresses for Women Size 1X F-8]] that I purchased at the same time.  The length is perfect for it."
4.0,"Nice shirt, stretch but good looking shirt"
4.0,It runs smal so if you have a large wrist forget it.
4.0,colors are great.  lights didn't work very will.  other than that the bag is nice
4.0,Little overpriced but cute.
4.0,"Fits and functions well, just don’t like the feel of the fabric. I wish it was more flannel-y to fit the look."
4.0,"Pretty but way too small. I'm 5ft 6in tall and 135 lbs. I wear a size medium but based on the reviews, I ordered a size large it was way too tight . I could not even get it on. Reading further now, it seems that everyone did not have the same experience.  it seems that the white and the black are not as small as the pink. Unlikely that the pink extra large would fit on my medium frame. I really like it but I'm not going to try for another size."
4.0,Very easy to use. Material is made of is hard plastic not rubber.
4.0,This oversized tunic is light weight. I would classify it more as sweater than a sweatshirt. It does have a tight weave. It is not see through. I wore a black bra underneath it and the light brown color was more than adequate to prevent it from peeking through the weave. It's a good length and doesn't show my backside when I stretch or reach. Overall I am pleased with it.
4.0,I thought it had a lining n it don't material is really thin...
4.0,These are great just as I expected.  The only issue is that I received a purple pair and not grey.  It is still a nice color.
4.0,"I just wish it didn't come down past my knees, but I'm only 5'3&#34; so I guess that's expected."
4.0,"It is a very pretty dress.  The top is a bit snug but still flattering. It's also a bit short.  I was expecting a softer cotton stretchy material though,  It is more like a nylon.  I like it though."
4.0,"Comfortable dress and fit as expected. The pockets, however, protrude a bit from the hips, making my hip width seem a bit larger than normal."
4.0,I love material not thin but not to thick. Love the length . It’s very long not really for a short person would be on the floor
4.0,"I love me some nice silk jammies after a hot shower. These were really cute. I will say I’ve definitely tried better “silk” pajamas, but with that being said these are nice and worth the money in my opinion."
4.0,Pricey but nice E I guess you get what you pay for
4.0,Def not the best quality but for the price it looks great!
4.0,So cute. My daughter loves them and says they are comfy. Only drawback is the laces. They are extremely long. Even after being tied.
4.0,Good looking item
4.0,"Very convenient, really reduce glare and light; unfortunately, they reduce vision as well."
4.0,Good transaction and good product
4.0,Very comfortable mask and I bought these because the straps don’t go behind the ears. This was my 3rd order of these and they have held up well after repeated washings. Overall very happy with these and would order again. Made in the USA!!!
4.0,tough
4.0,"This baby hat is cute and will be prefect for winter, It is much larger then i expected.  I would say this would not fit until closer to a year old. The color is bright and true to the picture. The yard is soft and construction is well made.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I was given this item at a discount to review and express my unbiased opinion, my thought and feelings on this item are my own."
4.0,The gloves are well made and lovely to look at.  Wish they went past my wrists.  Also not very warm for New England weather.  The chill goes right through them.  If you are looking to appear stylish these are for you if you are looking for warmth keep looking
4.0,Cute shirts but a Lil see thru
4.0,"The bracelet is ok. It hasn’t turned colors. However, the necklace changed colors. Not sure if  the necklace is 925 claiming to be, real silver. I wear real 925 silver.  Amd to date it has not turned. 925 silver wearers know the silver they purchase."
4.0,"Excellent leather and pull out mechanism. The Rfid blocking is so good and strong that it prevents me from keeping my job's ID card in the wallet and just swiping to enter. I have to remove it from the wallet all the time and swipe. Unfortunately because of that I had to stop using it and get a non RFid wallet.<br />If you don't have to use your ID like this, please buy it. It's well made and does a great job of blocking all your cards for security. The pull out mechanism is excellent."
4.0,"Ball at bottom of post is quite large, in fact it's painful to put in. However, once in it's NOT coming out on accident. Might try filing down slightly since it is acrylic."
4.0,Such a cute suit! The bottoms came with a lot of extra booty fabric that I didn't need so after I took that in the suit fit perfectly. I am 5'7 145ish pounds and ordered the medium.
4.0,Fit great. Beautiful on but does catch on everything due to the material. Also dries quickly.
4.0,"These earrings are nice. I like that they are double sided. However, they are a lot smaller that I expected."
4.0,"This product fits and is comfortable, affordable, shipped quick, came with a free necklace and personal note too! The only note I'll leave is that it's not as long as the pictures look, if you're looking for a true tunic go with the All For You brand shirt it's $12, all the same sizes, better quality fabric, longer, and just all around better."
4.0,Cute and easy to wear very light
4.0,"Super cute, but wasn’t covered in glitter and much smaller than expected. Perfect for a child. I’ll still use it as a statement bag."
4.0,These work great.  The clasp on the back is invaluable with long hair.  The mirrored one is a little blurry under water but both have a tight seal that does not leak.  Fits adults and kids easily.
4.0,"Sizing: i'm a small skinny guy at 5'6&#34; 120 lbs. Ordered a size S/M, had size around knuckles is 7.75&#34; and 9.5&#34; biceps extended (11.5&#34; flexing) . Its a snug fit. You should be fine up to 10.5&#34; extended biceps but any larger, I'd go up a size. Don't see why outdoor research can't put this on their site, is it really so hard? I was a skeptic at first but it does had a cooling effect. Significantly more than the sentinel and sun versions? I can't say. Was barely more expensive than the regular sun version so I bit.<br />Quality: Material-wise, looks solid as long as your not bush whacking. I've only barely received it , just basing this off my experience with clothing of similar material. my issue is with the thumb hole, clearly they need to step up their quality control. One hole is slightly smaller than the other. Its slight but you notice it when its on. Not enough to warrant a return but i will subtract 1 star<br />Side note: tags are stitched in using a separate thread so you can cut it out without compromising the integrity. Such detail! if they could only have applied the same care to the thumb holes.<br />Hopefully this helps!"
4.0,Warms my hands except fingertips. Works when using text.
4.0,"These socks are very warm and comfortable. They are really thick and would not fit well into shoes, but would be fine in ski boots. They have good stretch and fit snugly and don’t slip down."
4.0,"Fit is ok, just need to redo the arm opening it's too tight."
4.0,A little large but very comfortable. I was having a bit of pain in my left foot and these slippers seem to have corrected that. Well done.
4.0,"This dress runs kind of large. I am 5'4&#34;, 130 pounds and usually wear a medium. I ordered this dress in a small. Without a belt it looks awful. With a belt I think it is very flattering. I ordered the yellow and it makes me happy lol. The material is a little thin.  I am posting pics with and without a belt so you can see the difference."
4.0,Good look can  dress up or down I wore it to a wedding and it looked great
4.0,It's a nice top and looks like the Pic. It does run little on the larger end.
4.0,Didn't fit. Run small
4.0,It fits my head very well and the price is good for 3 caps. The colors are exact same as the picture. The reason why I give it 4 stars because the buttons are way too behind my ears and I have to move them to the front.
4.0,These work well.. for a few months. Then stretch out.  I’m about to order my 3rd one. Wish they lasted longer without completely stretching.
4.0,Love the softness and stretchiness of the shirt. Design is beautiful. Only concern I have is when washing how the design will be effected. It feels and looks kind of like plastic as far as where the design is. Sizing is perfect! I got xl and it fits just how I like.
4.0,Love it!! It is beautiful and cute!
4.0,Great fit good quality everything i expected
4.0,I bought the grey colored one. I’m a medium and that’s the size I bought. It fits perfectly.
4.0,"The color selection was nice. The sizing on this runs as expected for me. I had silicone implants removed and needed a comfortable, surgery type bra to support and not interfere with drainage tubes at the same time. Since I am in an already uncomfortable situation, the bra needed to be gentle and soft. It is that - some compression but not as much as my Jockey zip-front sport bra. I like the sewn in tabs which cover bottom and top of zipper.<br />The one drawback to these is that they are not a true racer back style. The arms are not cut out enough. As a result my shoulder blades are rubbing the inside rolled seam edge which is annoying and I imagine moreso when trying to fall asleep"
4.0,I ordered yesterday and recieved my package today.  It looks nice and fits well. Not sure but it seems to be well made. I will update the durability rating after a few washes but satisfied as of now.
4.0,I had to reattach the string on both mittens (fell off after first wear) plus the bears were only glued on and not sewn on.  They both fell off in the first washing.  Disappointed in the quality of how they were put together.  Mittens themselves fit great and are very warm.
4.0,"I love these, cushy and warm, without being bulky. I ordered two sets. Downside: it is serious work to get into them, totally worth it because they are comfortable and warm, but I worry they aren't going to hold up because of this added strain fighting to get them on. And I rather doubt they would work for someone any bigger than me at my highly average size. Also they are seriously inconsistent, of the four pair I received no two were the same thickness and the purple were two different shades, I don't much care about the color since I intend only to wear them as an under layer considering the weird double seams. But I am sorry that the black are so much lighter in weight than the purple, the thickest purple pair is really what would like to see in all 4 pair."
4.0,Very light weight. Perfect for fall or Chicago spring. I wore them in deep winter with tights on and felt pretty goid. Long long straps.
4.0,This set is nice to look at.  The &#34;stone&#34; parts are not stone but I knew that going in.  What I didn't expect was for it to look like a sticker.  As long as no one gets too close it will look like stone. LOL!  Time will tell if it hold up.  Still it is pretty and not too heavy.
4.0,"It really is cute and would've been perfect for what I needed; however, I'm a short woman and the dang thing went to my knee's so I didn't wear it.  I guess if the need arises for me a tutu in the future, I will get scissors & cut it, I didn't think of that at the time.  Overall, this is exactly as described & it did fit perfect in the waist."
4.0,"Fits perfect. I’m realizing Nike rubs bug and adidas runs small/true to size bc I ordered a Nike hoodie at the same time & same size & it’s baggy. This is a large and fits perfectly, meaning slightly form fitting, not tight but def not baggy. That’s how I like my active west to fit.  I’m 5’8” about 195 lbs & ordered large . skinny long legs with belly weight but it covers everything without having to be tucked in. Happy with this purchase bc of the zipper that goes down if you want cleavage or goes up for warmth. No pockets tho. -0.5 stars."
4.0,FIt good
4.0,The Watch Winder looks very nice and elegant. Works well.<br />Not 100 % happy because is missing the key and the instructions. Did not come in the box.
4.0,"I like the dress... Very soft fabric and fits very nicely, but the sleeves have a smaller size that doesn't goes with the loose style of the dress. And because they are a little tight, they are not very comfy for me."
4.0,"I had to add jump rings on the ends to use with my glasses, but they work very well and are quite attractive."
4.0,"Was very pretty, but much smaller than xl. Was way too small to wear."
4.0,It is the perfect retro swimsuit. Cute and sexy at the same time! I would suggest you measure yourself before choosing a size. I usually wear a 10US and ordered a large.
4.0,A few weeks in and I’m liking. I’m liking a lot.
4.0,"The shoes look great and my son really likes them, but they are too big for him. He has had 3 other pairs of size 13 Jordans and they all fit perfect. He needs a size 12 in these."
4.0,Would absolutely love them if I realized I would be too short to wear them. The seeming is perfect to hug your curves when working out. However you definitely need to be the right height to wear them because even after cuffing them they looked funny. Will probably give them to my tall friend.
4.0,"More pink than purple, not as pictured"
4.0,They look and feel great. I will buy some more
4.0,Kinda thin.  For the price it was as expected.  Works great with the pants I bought it to go with.  Not unhappy with purchase.
4.0,Nice deep pockets. However the material is a little thin.
4.0,"The fabric is soft, stretches and it’s not sheer. However, the garment fits large in the bust area."
4.0,Love them but they are a bit small :(
4.0,Comfortable and flattering material. Slightly see through however.
4.0,"Love the look, think it's worth the price, can't wait to wear it. Would love to see something in silver color."
4.0,Much higher quality than I was expecting. Fits true to size and looks great!
4.0,"I'm so glad I followed previous reviews, and sized up. I'm a size small or size 2 in most clothes. This shirt I ordered large, and it's a perfect fit. A little room, but not baggy. Exactly the fit I wanted. The inside is super soft and warm. I only gave 4 stars to account for the sizing, but I love it otherwise. Unless you want a tight fit, size up."
4.0,Fast delivery<br />Looks great<br />But was to small
4.0,"The piece in nice craftsmanship, amazing color, and light weight. It is a statement piece. The pendant size is larger than I anticipated (larger than a quarter) and I was thinking it would be more marble size."
4.0,I ordered 2 and they took about 3 months to arrive. They were cute but the band was a bit too stiff. Good quality for what I paid.
4.0,Item was as described.  No problems.
4.0,XL is a tad snug on the butt behind.  They feel so nice on I'm willing to lose a lb or two.
4.0,"Four stars instead of five simply because I would prefer the skirt and sleeve length to be longer. Otherwise, very happy with this dress. The fabric is stretchy like swimsuit material, but a bit heavier so it doesn't cling. I like the soft comfy feel. I am 5' and 91 lb. and got the small. Fits perfectly throughout the bodice and waist. The hem hits a little above mid calf."
4.0,"Style is VERY similar to Lulu half-zip scubas! Material is nowhere near as soft. Sizing is tricky to compare since LL combines sizes, but I would say the medium in this fits a bit larger than the M/L at Lulu. For reference I’m 5’2” 130lbs and wear an XS/S in LL scuba.<br /><br />I will say it arrived in unacceptable condition - it had been shoved (unfolded) into the clear plastic and the tag was in the pocket. Also there were a number of cat hairs on it. Clearly a return that wasn’t cleaned up and retagged or even folded.<br /><br />Will be returning this since it’s huge on me and I prefer the look of the black material of a different dupe I found that was $10 cheaper than this one. However, I will try this brand in a XS or S in a different color when it comes available."
4.0,The earring is very adorable.
4.0,Like this for easy cool comfort wear  for summer
4.0,"I will admit that I when I bought this stop, I didn't expect it to be so small and I may have ripped some stitches trying to put it on. But I've worn it a lot and have gotten used to wearing the top. Now I can't stop using this top."
4.0,"This kilt is perfectly adequate if one isn't looking for a heavy-duty, utilikilt-type garment. The cloth from which it's made is rather thin. The blue/black version has a button closure and runs true to size. It's not too wrinkly after a wash if you line dry it. Good for Renaissance fairs or just loafing around. Made in China."
4.0,This watch is very trendy and classy yet can be worn casually with jeans.
4.0,I've only had these about a week and so far they're just as I expected. I only wish there were different color options available!
4.0,Very soft! Be careful when washing! Hand washing is best! I put it to wash and the inside cotton made a mess!! Very delicate material but if you know how to care for them they are great!
4.0,"This dress was super cute, and a decent quality. I am a 38 DD and the top was stressed... I sent it back."
4.0,"Lovely crewneck. Textured. Cropped without being too cropped. I ordered a medium and I am 5’7” 130 pounds. Perfectly oversized. Nice and lightweight.<br /><br />I will say, do NOT dry this unless you want it to shrink a solid size. I dried it once and it was fine, after the second time washing and drying it shrunk significantly. My mistake but wanted to call that out!"
4.0,"Decided to buy this purse based on the reviews. I am happy with it. Perfect size, nice compartments, only wish it had a small inside pocket in the front main compartment for a pack of tissues. But it's a nicely made stylish bag for the price."
4.0,"Cute dress, kind of flares out on the bottom which is kind of nice. Wear it casual with sandals and wore it out at night with some suede over the knee boots. Super comfy dress, not too short. I'm 5'4'', 122 lbs and wear a size small"
4.0,Well made...looks great..many compliments
4.0,Warm socks!
4.0,"Print is really beautiful. Colors are vibrant and add a punch of style. Socks run large. I am a size 6 and the heel doesn't quite sit on my heel. I did find the material a little stretchy and it separates where you can see the backside of the white stitching. Overall still a great sock, cool design and eye catching!"
4.0,will be fine for what I need it for.
4.0,"I have a wedding coming up and saw this dress advertised.  I decided to just try it, and if it didn't work for me, I could always send it back.  I'm so glad I got it.  It looks great.  I only gave it 4 stars because the material is pretty thin.  I also looked at the size chart, and I got a dress in the perfect size.  Also, because I'm shorter the dress comes right to my knee so it's a great length."
4.0,It's not
4.0,its a bit too big for my noes but its good for my ticci toby cosplay
4.0,"Thinner than expected,  but soft."
4.0,"I normally wear a medium and bought the s/m sized legging in the grey ombré. They fit slightly small but not bad at all. 5'5, 130lbs, and athletic. They are squat proof! Very comfortable and attractive. Only complaint is that the rise is a little lower than I prefer. Overall happy with the item!"
4.0,"It’s very soft, I like the distressed look, and it holds up in the wash. It’s a LITTLE tight in the arms, but otherwise very comfortable and very flattering"
4.0,Good product.  Performs as expected.
4.0,I wear a size 6 and these fit perfect.
4.0,"A good watch for the price point. The band is nice and stretchy and the entire of the watch feels of a good build (price-point wise), save for the little movable band that looks like it could come apart at a movements notice.<br /><br />Not exactly as pictured: The face of the watch is not the multicolor face that is shown, but has a few wiggly lines that are the color of the watch. Would definitely have liked the rainbow pattern, but it's still cool."
4.0,"What a really elegant, comfortable dress. With flat shoes to work and high heels to go out."
4.0,Swiss Gear is it! I searched high and low for a messenger-style bag with at least a zipper instead of just a flap. This bag fit the bill in terms of design and price. The only flaw is the pouch that holds the on/off light switch for the night-time reflector is not very secure. Therefore the switch is never held securely in place and gets bashed around often. Still works though.
4.0,Love the style and fit. Super lite. Can't wait to wear them fishing. The bifocal lenses are the perfect strength to see the fishing line when tying it. Not sure about the polarization right now. Will have to find out if they are polarized once out on the water.<br />Good glasses. Recommend.
4.0,"I bought these pants for my five year old daughter. These pants are too long for her! My daughter is 3.6ft tall, but these pants fit a 4.2ft child. I don't think she'll be able to wear them for at least a year or two, so I'm keeping them for now. I wish you would mark the pants in the correct size!"
4.0,"I really like this bag but only gave it 4 stars because after about a month the small change purse ripped on the inside and one of the zippers on the inside fell off, but for the price I really can't complain that's why I still gave it 4 stars. It definitely fits a lot of stuff and although I haven't washed it seems like it will be easy to clean."
4.0,My son thought it was a little too large but he still likes it.
4.0,"These boots are nice. I bought them to wear just for Halloween. Didn't think they would be as nice as they are. Do like that you can lace them as tight as you want then then zip off. Seem pretty sturdy. Only had them on for about 10 mins, so not sure about all day comfort yet"
4.0,"It’s about what I expected. Part of the strap broke pretty quickly when played with, but it worked fine for a kid’s circus ringmaster costume. I’d rather none of it broke, but it served its purpose."
4.0,I use when playing golf
4.0,"This is the first time I have purchased a bag on line. It was great to pick the style, size and color without shopping at several stores and not finding that perfect purse.  Thank you!"
4.0,Thought the extra large would fit a little more loosely but fits like a large.
4.0,DID NOT ASPECT THE VELCRO CLOSURE. HOPED WAS ONLY MAGNETS AS IT IS ON THE SIDE PACKET.
4.0,Great jacket. Ordered regular size and it fits well. Love the material.
4.0,It's pretty but runs 2 sizes small. I had to return it because I only ordered 1 size larger.
4.0,Quality is great. Fits a bit on the small side.
4.0,fits in hiking bag
4.0,"I like it, but fits smaller than I wanted"
4.0,"This Pearl Leaf Pendant Charm Bracelet has become one of my favorite accessories. The vintage pearl design and finish compliment any style dressed up or down. I have a very small wrist so I worry when buying bracelets, but this is adjustable style fits nicely. The big lobster claw is very sturdy and holds the weight well. I also love that you can add charms to personalize all your own.<br />I received this at a discount in exchange for a fair and honest review."
4.0,Cute little heart bracelet for the price.. Nice catch on it too.. The price was also good..
4.0,Great dancing shoes!!!
4.0,"The hair looks really great to be honest.. It can curl nicely and it's soft and not too shiny.. But I've never used clip in hair before and there were no instructions, so I have absolutely no idea how to get it on my head and will have to do a little searching on the internet I guess so that I can figure it out."
4.0,It was a perfect fit and looks nice
4.0,"Thick material, seems well put together. Zipper is a little weak and I expect to have to replace it within a few weeks. Slanted zipper on left side is a working zipper that opens up to nothing. I normally wear a 42"", but went with a size up to 44"". I could have went with my normal size, but they still fit.<br />****update*****<br />Been through the wash several times and the zippers are doing fine. The material is also doing fine, no unnecessary ware and they are still soft ass heck."
4.0,Just not enough pockets for my taste.
4.0,"Based on reviews stating these masks were ""huge"", I ordered the normals. They were much too small for me. I ordered the Large and they fit me much better. The ear loops are small and do not contain elastic. They are hard to get on and hurt my ears a little."
4.0,Zipper is hard to get started. Great except<br />for that
4.0,"I’ve been wearing reading glasses for about five years (2.25x). I noticed that they just didn’t seem to be providing a sharp reading experience lately, so I figured it was time to get a pair a bit stronger. I debated endlessly it seemed between 2.5x and 2.75x, and I finally decided to go with the 2.75x. As it turns out, this magnification is working very well,and unless I see a 2.5x pair when I’m shopping, I’ll never know if I chose the best strength for me.<br /><br />Anyhow, I wasn’t sure if I would adjust to these half reading glasses. Different than my old pair but I must say it’s nice to be able to look up and see the world without the magnification. I’m not convinced that I notice any difference with the anti-Blu-ray lenses though. Time will tell.<br /><br />The only thing I need to try and get used to is the rope (one comes with this pair). Why, because the frame design is way different than my plastic readers and every time I take these off and put them on my head, when I go to put them back on, I notice they’re pulling out some hair, and really who needs that. Except for actually using the lanyard to reduce hair loss/breakage and probably using a different case to store both pairs( I’m not a fan of this hard to open and close plastic case), both pair are doing exactly what I wanted, letting me see better."
4.0,Nice material and colors
4.0,The length was good and the fit
4.0,This jacket runs small. Normally a Large jacket is what I wear and it gives me plenty of room. At times I have had to do Medium because sometime  Large is to big.  I ordered this Jacket in XL because I was planning on needing to wear a bulky sweater at times during my trip.  The XL fits like a small Large.  I love the design and have decided to keep it and take something else for any really cold days.
4.0,"matches the description, a &#34;real&#34; oversized glasses<br />good quality, a very stylish shape, and fits very well on my face"
4.0,"Fits a pear shape well , but it wrinkles so easily making me not wear it as often as I would otherwise."
4.0,"Don’t need much else; softness, I guess.  Which it is!"
4.0,Buy a size up if you want it to fit!
4.0,"It was beautiful,but did not know that it was not in US size. So it was 2 sizes too small. My friend really loved it though!"
4.0,Bonitos pero demasiado pequeños
4.0,The hat is cute and its the right size but the material is crude and unyielding. I wish it was a tad softer.
4.0,"I am shocked at some of the reviews for these sweatpants. I have been buying them since 2019.  I work from home and LIVE in these.  I have at least 6 pairs, having worn a couple out(1-2) in 4 years is not bad. I did recently buy a pair with pockets. My others did not have pockets.  I am returning the pocket pair as they tore by the pocket. I will say the material was thinner than the non pockets.  I will continue to buy the non pockets style for as long as these are available.  I am 5’6 and 170 lbs.  I wear a 10-12 in jeans/pants and I get the XL for great comfort.  The large fits and is not skin tight but I prefer the XL.  Hope this helps clear up some of the negative reviews.  Oh and one person says you can’t machine wash and dry.  Yes you can. I have for 4 years."
4.0,Love the design and fit of hat but color purple not as vivid as shown in photo; kinda greyed down. .the design seems versatile for dressier or casual wear.
4.0,it was a gift - I think she liked it
4.0,medium support
4.0,Super cute. Nice width. I am normally a size 9 ring but this is running a little small (as you can see in the photo). I’ll be returning it for a size 10.
4.0,"I am 5'4 and weigh 170lbs and ordered the Large.  I should have ordered the XL.  These fit but as soon as I walked around my  abundant posterior made the leggings gradually slip down, lol.  I never had leggings do this before.  But whenever I sat down or walked, my leggings would do the slip and slide down my bum.  Very embarrassing to correct in public, having to pull my leggings back up.  The material feels like nice moisture wicking material and it is thin, which I like as I live in Florida, no need for thick warm leggings here.  Aside from the sizing, these are great leggings if you are not bootylicious."
4.0,"This is my sons second pair of Stride-right shoes! These are great for balance and fit him very well! They are pretty easy to get on, a little stiffer than his last pair though! My son is 12 months and has been walking since 9 months, and has been wearing nothing but stride rites, they really do help! Highly recommended!"
4.0,"When I first put these pants on, they were a bit tight .As I wore them throughout the day, they loosened and are super comfy."
4.0,I am 5'9&#34; and I bought a large. I normally wear a 10. It is very flattering and goes to my ankles so its not short. I love it.
4.0,"This is very soft and pretty, but it was much too large.  I am returning it and I ordered a smaller size."
4.0,"Beautiful dress and style. Didn’t fit my body well, but I wished it had. Loved the material and design!"
4.0,Their uggs they always fit well
4.0,These sunglasses are super cute and fit well on my face. I always look my sun glasses by the end of summer so this price is great for that.
4.0,good value👍
4.0,Good quality.  Fit as expected.  The top is slightly revealing.  I will need to pin it.
4.0,Super cute but really small.
4.0,Very cute. A little snug. I usually wear a size 10.
4.0,Pajamas looked and felt great but listed only 3 sizes (s m l) with no guidelines on age therefore they were way too big and I had to return them.  No small except in Christmas print.
4.0,I bought this as a gift for my daughter and she loves it! I love it and when I received it thought it wad made really good and love the design and color! Best purchase I made in a while. Definitely worth the money! At that price you can't go wrong!
4.0,"This is a lovely, practically designed handbag. The color is brilliant and fashionable. It appears to be thoughtfully proportioned and attractive."
4.0,"My son likes them; however, they're very small. He wishes they were bigger."
4.0,"A very well made satchel, although I notice perhaps the latest from the company appear now to be without rivets at the bottom lashing points and, some changes to the top rivets near the handle are not of a uniform type anymore, that doesn't bother me as I'm not likely to attach external items to it, as it weighs in at 5Llbs when empty!  Pens and other small items can fall out if it tips over, so, inner pen cases will be required. I have carefully removed what I regard as surplus lashing rings, without cutting leather or stitching, leaving only the essential ones, such as for rucksack or shoulder carry configuration, just to bring the weight down, it is such a well made satchel, in no time at all it can get incredibly heavy but, the paradox is, I love it!"
4.0,"I wore this dress to the theater for a celebration with my family.  It fit well, looked great, and was soooo comfortable for a long evening out!  I gave 4 stars because there was a hole in the seam of one of the pockets, but I can easily stitch that up.  Shipping was quick, and I wore it straight out of the packaging, no wrinkles!  I will order more of these dresses!"
4.0,"Before ordering I read the reviews and everyone complained about the smell, well that was true! It was like rotten fish, but eventually the smell fades. I use it often"
4.0,Great for light projects.
4.0,"It’s sparkly and as pretty as in the picture.  It’s fairly big, about 1.5 to 2 inches in diameter.  I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because there’s black tarnish (around my neck) after I remove it each time.  It’s tough to remove the tarnish off my skin until I shower (after multiple showers).  I wish they offered a tarnish free necklace.  It’s pretty otherwise and feels durable (though tangles easily since it’s a thin necklace)."
4.0,"For the price, these underwear are the Best Buy out there. The fabric is thin, but lightweight for warmer weather. They fit nicely and don't roll or gather up in the crotch (very important). They're virtually unnoticeable under clothing and don't leave lines that I've had with other boxer/boy cut shirts."
4.0,A little to big but still a very good buy.  Comfortable.
4.0,"I like these for playing basketball. Since I started using them I no longer get blisters on my toes. However, they tear very easily and after just the second use trying to pull them on they tore a big hole on the ankle. The same thing happened to the previous pairs of these I bought. However, they work well, so I will keep buying them."
4.0,My 13 y.o. conservative daughter loves this bathing suit.  Loves the higher waist and good coverage.
4.0,Didn't fit around the girls
4.0,"Pretty necklace, it's nice."
4.0,A little shorter than I would have liked (and I usually buy petites) but still okay.  Fun shirt for the Halloween season.
4.0,"I like it.  The plastic drill head that digs into the sand needs to be more sturdy.  It twisted up today when I was sinking it in the beach today to set the umbrella.  That said, the umbrella has some really smart features and is our go to for a day on the sand here in Cape Canaveral, FL."
4.0,"The set was what I wanted, but it's hard to get the backs on the studs they almost bent when you try putting them on."
4.0,Love the color and fits very well.
4.0,"On time, no problems. no issues"
4.0,"Reasonable quality jersey fabric. I really like that it has pockets.<br /><br />It was just a little light, especially around my shoulders.<br /><br />Other wise great. Next time I will order one size bigger."
4.0,"The bottom of this is a little loose, but I kind of expected that. I'm 5'4'' and 140, and usually wear an XXS in the Dolfin Uglies series. However, this only comes in an XS, so the bottom is a little loose, but the top fits well. Nice pattern, and I like that the straps are different from the normal Y-back."
4.0,"Please note that if you have a wider nipple or if you’ve been pierced further back that this will fit SNUG<br />I have a piercing that is further back because I have a repiercing  it is very snug, I will have to be diligent about cleaning and swap it out for a regular barbell every so often.<br />Other than that it is super cute and I hope it works out for me!"
4.0,"So far I love these, they are the exact size I wanted and stand out away from the ear instesd of being flush against it.They do have some type of faint color but definitely not nearly as much as pictured."
4.0,"Looks like picture. However it’s such thin material you could easily spit through it! Literally!  The material clearly shows your bra and for me, ALL my arm tattoos!"
4.0,"The box was excellent quality, I was very impressed to unpack it when it arrived. I really really like the box, though we did end up returning it, as it was just a little too big for our needs.  Regardless, I would still recommend it to someone looking for a product like this.  The slots for glasses should easily accommodate glasses of all sizes."
4.0,Pretty pattern but it is only on the front of the dress. That bothered me a little so I returned it. Would be cute with a light summer cardigan or kimono. Not too tight but not too big.
4.0,"My son used this for his green arrow costume. He has used it a few times since as well just playing around. We did have to cut part of the inside around the nose because it was poking him and kind of uncomfortable, but after we did it was great!. Seems like it is quality work."
4.0,I found the material a little hard. But they are comfy
4.0,Great glass ..but too small for my face
4.0,"I ordered the size I normally wear.  They are VERY supportive/TIGHT and high wasted but so tight that they roll down.  If it wasn't for that I would say they are a great buy, especially for the price.  I'm sure they work for some, just not me."
4.0,"I love it.  I am 5'6 36DD, I got a large. It fits great in the chest, and falls about 1.5&#34; above knee.  The material is soft and flowy and IS NOT see through.  I ordered the rose pink, and black.  My only complaint, is that once I opened the bag the tunic comes in, it smelled like chemicals..like a spray paint almost.  Other than the smell, the tunic is great. I highly recommend."
4.0,"Wish it would come in large but it's so comfortable, love the fit will definitely buy again. Wish I had one in every  color."
4.0,"I like these chokers, but I'm worried how long they will last. I received 8 and ended up giving 4 away as Christmas presents. The gift receipt really enjoys them and wears them daily. They have yet to break. They are pretty, soft, and comfortable. They are somewhat adjustable."
4.0,It's very soft but didn't bend well where it attaches to the watch face. It might have to wear in a bit.
4.0,"The style was great, but fit runs small. I wish it had fit. It was exactly the style I was going for. I was very disappointed I couldn't reorder in a larger size. :-("
4.0,Fits great and comfortable and warm
4.0,It's  greats for the price .. I was surprise  but happy  .. Just was I looking for  a long time for a red belts
4.0,My daughter got a blister wearing these all day. Need to break them in.
4.0,"Love the idea  very cute, but, the top is too small and bottoms too big. Had to order a 4 for the bottoms to fit, them the top is way too small, ordered 2 different sizes to make a match"
4.0,For my 72 year old 5'4&#34; and 160 pound wife with a bit of  a tummy. It fits well around her  hips and  middle but is a tiny bit loose across the bust. The shoulder seam is spot on at the bend down her arms. Overall the dress looks nice on her and is well made. I recommend it for economical but classy looking everyday wear for work and casual dress up occaisions.
4.0,My wife loves her new sunglasses. I can tell that I truly made her happy. Thank you VOX
4.0,Thes were awesome!  Great looking and nice quality.
4.0,"Very cute and stylish but the material is super thin, almost see through."
4.0,It's a bit too big for a kid's pocket.
4.0,I am 5'7&#34; and a muscular 135. These leggings fit me well and feel good. A nice medium weight.
4.0,Little flimsy and cheap feeling but looks great and is comfortable. Perfect for matching with an outfit.
4.0,"I like this scarf, but the zipper is white (scarf is red) and can be seen if the scarf isn't turn the right way. You also have to avoid the tag."
4.0,"I love this, only complaint it it has dual zippers. I hate dual zippers... other than that it’s great."
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:556c9e1161b39675b3c289dcb2b7c99d]] I usually wear a L or XL. 38C, 36 waist, 47 hip. this is very very stretchy. Didn’t hold in anything as far as my shape. Love the look. I will be returning to size or 2 down. The breast area is very loose and will need to be pinned to stay put."
4.0,Bought this for my mother. Really great price on item...My mother loves it!<br /><br />Came quickly and came in nice pagacking as well...Homerun!
4.0,"TOFT, and I have to say this bag is very nice for the price point. I needed a duffle for the weekend, and wanted a classic leather looking bag without breaking my bank. This is the only faux leather bag I found on Amazon that has a similar style to the few hundred dollar leather duffles (Floto).<br /><br />To start off, the dimensions on the description are incorrect. The bag is ~18&#34; long, 12&#34; wide. The bag was durable enough to be filled to the brim with a pair of leather shoes, 4 shirts, 2 pants, 3 socks, a belt, 3 underwears, and toiletries. It withstood the hardship of being dropped on the floor. It came with a fabric shoulder strap which was comfortable. It did its job, and I would buy again."
4.0,Lively color and design but a bit too snug around the midriff so not as flattering as expected
4.0,The bag seemed to be very sturdy with lots of pockets which was a plus. The color however wasn't quite a pictures so I ended up returning. I had purchased the blue and the one i received was quite a bit lighter than pictured and had more of a medium wash denim look. Not a bad thing over all just not what I was looking for.
4.0,"I liked the rich mahogany color , but I wished they were a bit larger in length . I think they are beautiful."
4.0,"Bought this to take on a hiking trip. It's a bit small, but not bad"
4.0,"Love this suit! I got so many compliments whenever I wore it. I bough this while pregnant and it fit perfect once I got a bump<br /> For fitting reference during pregnancy I was 6ft tall, 155 lbs and bought the large. Now that Ive lost my pregnancy weight it no longer fits. I am going to buy another in a medium which should fit perfect! I saw the comments about it being really long which sold me because I am tall. So glad I bought this! The coloring is a little off than in the picture, which is why I gave it 4 stars. The top is a navy blue, the bottom is white with navy blue pattern. The second picture shows me in it pre-pregnancy. For fitting reference I was 6ft and 120 lbs wearing a size large."
4.0,"Excellent quality, especially given the price. However, I don’t have the same body I had back in the 90’s when I last wore one...let’s just say my “fanny” cannot any bigger, or it won’t fit!  Time to cut back on some carbs!"
4.0,Wish it was easier to clean
4.0,"Overall a pretty solid pair of glasses. The glasses came with two nice cases, one is a soft travel case, and one is more durable case. It also came with a microfiber tissue to clean lenses with. Overall, a solid pair of sunglasses for the price."
4.0,Cute socks but I could do without the electric blue color and one of my socks got a hole in it after not having it for long.
4.0,"I like it a lot especially for the price. It looks like the picture, very delicate though. I would recommend."
4.0,I am usually a medium in cardis so that is what I purchased. The sweater was slightly tight around my arms but the material got a little looser throughout the day and after a second wear. I love the material! The sweater is super comfy and there is zero piling on the sweater after multiple wears as well as zero color fading. Definitely a staple in my closet. I will be purchasing more colors!
4.0,I ordered this twice. The first one never came but I was quickly refunded and able to order the second one. Its beautiful and will work great for a flower girl dress
4.0,"Believe it or not, this is my very first pair of white sandals. I saw these and thought they were too cute to pass up. I’ve always been afraid to wear white sandals, because of the so-called rules of wearing white shoes, but I couldn’t pass these up. They are very cute and comfortable. They run a little big, but it’s not too noticeable. I could have gone a half size shorter and they would have fit me perfectly. They’re very easy to walk in and the heel is so unique. Love these."
4.0,Frames are not sturdy enough but they are good for reading and computer screens
4.0,Quality product. UPS ruined the 5 star rating.
4.0,"Great glasses for the price, the plastic feels too cheap to give it five stars but I have had them for a couple months now and haven't managed to break them so that's a plus. The lenses are very good quality."
4.0,A bit frail
4.0,A little snug but cute. Costume quality is good.
4.0,The leather quality looks and feels more like pleather.
4.0,"These are very pretty. I have the violet and the color matches the photo. They actually look better than the picture.  They are fairly heavy and I can only wear them a couple of hours before they start hurting my ear from the weight. They are larger and longer than I expected. They would be just as pretty if they were about  a third of the length shorter. I really like the earrings,...so I may take it upon myself to shorten them. I would be able to wear them longer. I purchased discounted for reviewing."
4.0,this is a nice cardigan! fabric is heavy and well made.
4.0,"The shirt fit, but it was a little short on me. I'm 5'6&#34;"
4.0,"Couldn't find my tie pin (later found out that one of my son' had taken it) and so I just needed a replacement tie pin.  I wear a tie maybe 5 times a year so I didn't need to buy an expensive one so this one fit my needs.  It is just a simple tie pin, what you see is what you get."
4.0,Pretty good quality.  Not as silky as another wig I recently purchased.  I love the length and that it holds shape.
4.0,"Fits large. Nice color, a little longer than expected"
4.0,"I love this dress. It’s great for hot weather nights out and it’s comfy. If my stomach was flatter, it would look great, so maybe if your tummy pokes out below your waist you might feel self-conscious in this dress. I love it so much I wear it anyway."
4.0,"I've been wearing my Horze winter tights for almost 3 months now.  These have quickly become my favorite winter tights.  (I previously wore Kerrits Sit Tight 'n Warm tights, but don't love how bulky/squeaky their full seats are and the knee patch tights don't have enough grip for the young frisky horses I ride).  The silicone dots provide the perfect amount of grip - just enough not to slide around but never make me feel ""stuck"" in the saddle.  I am convinced they saved me from a fall when a baby bolted with me the other day.  The mid-rise provides enough back coverage while still looking modern.  These are super comfortable and warm.  As far as sizing, I'd say order your usual size or maybe one size smaller if you like a tighter fit.  I am seeing a little minor pilling after many rides and washes, but it doesn't bother me considering I've paid over $100 more for other winter breeches I own.  I wash them inside out like the manufacturer recommends and I expect them to look good for at least two winter riding seasons.  I will definitely be buying more!"
4.0,Not real fond of the material in the summer. But have warn it several time
4.0,"As I was talking to my friend one day about how his credit card info was stolen through his wallet I became paranoid and decided to shop for an RFID blocking wallet. I don't know how often someone's info gets stolen that way but I figured better safe than sorry!<br /><br />I wasn't really expecting too much out of it but it was cuter than all of the other RFID blocking wallets at a decent price. I ordered it through Amazon prime which ended up taking a week to deliver instead of 2 days. The wallet itself is fantastic quality! It has a chemical smell to it but it's not bothersome. It feels extremely sturdy. I love that it comes with a little strap for your wrist. The zipper is also very nice quality and zips pretty easily. I definitely feel like this wallet looks like it's worth more than what I paid for it.<br /><br />Now, the downside to this wallet is the fact that there's not that many card slots. I almost didn't buy it because of that. I like having a lot of slots since I have a lot of random reward cards (haha.) Also, the slots seem to be a little snug. The cards do fit but I had to wiggle them in and it's kind of difficult to take out sometimes. If those issues don't bother you much then I would say purchase this wallet! It's definitely worth the money."
4.0,This is the second leotard we’ve picked up for our daughter. The fit is as expected and of good quality. I would definitely recommend it to others.
4.0,Great but<br />But one of the pieces was not attached so had to fix.
4.0,I bought these for my husband.  They fit over his regular glasses fairly well.  You can still see arms of his glasses on the side but from the front you can't tell he's wearing 2 pairs of glasses.  The frames are very light weight and are an inexpensive alternative to buying prescription sunglasses.
4.0,Know that this dress is see through. Your underwear will show. Other than that good quality. Fit was a bit too small but it still fit either way was just a bit uncomfortable.
4.0,"I had searched for these pants for awhile because they were discontinued in the store.  I was pleased with the fit,  but I think the fabric was down-graded as I noticed pilling pretty quickly."
4.0,"The necklace is everything that I wanted.  The initial is smaller than I thought it would be, but I can live with that.  I cn stack other necklaces with this.  That's why I bought it.  The clasp is good and the chain is sturdy."
4.0,"I love the style of these shirts.  I ordered two hoping for the best.  They are so cute, very stretchy.  My suggestion would be to size down unless you want the shirt to be a bit oversized.  I expected them to be a bit small but was surprised to see that they are definitely true to size.  I could have sized down easily.  The length is perfect for leggings."
4.0,I bougt it for my husband all ok but too wide in the sigh.
4.0,"They’re fine, nothing fancy, but I guess they do the job. The elastic is soft and has a little rubber adjuster on each side to tighten or loose. Two of them have come off, and I could have gone through the effort to get them back on, but I just tied a knot in the elastic to get it at the right size. Some loose threads show up after regular wear/washing that you need to trim. (Otherwise they tickle and annoy the kids). We’ve had them for a few months now, and for the price, they’ve held up fine."
4.0,"Fits true to size, not too short, and comfy!"
4.0,"The costume looks great, exactly as pictured. Price is good and it shipped fast. I am 5'3"" and 145 lbs and got the large. Since the material is stretchy and soft I could have been fine with a medium. Now I will be wearing a waist cinching belt to taper the dress to my hips."
4.0,"I just wish that the pad was more firm & wouldn't crumple or bend as easily.  Otherwise, the size of the Shoulder Pad fit just right on my shoulder & bag strap."
4.0,Fits perfect lifts glutes
4.0,"Wow, you can not beat these for the price!"
4.0,"Nice, shiny, beautiful. No idea how to put it back together."
4.0,These masks are the most comfortable masks I’ve worn so far. It took forever to get to me (hence the 4 stars) but it was well worth the wait.
4.0,My granddaughter loved the leotard she wore it on her first day of gymnastics. It allowed her the freedom of movement to do her exercises  and flips. Will purchase again.
4.0,Looks great! Great look. It is hard to find something for people in Vet field. It is just a little large for someone with a small neck.
4.0,"I really love this hoodie but it's not made for men. Unless that man is super thin with no muscles in the shoulders at all. For me, a lady, it fits really well. Originally, I got this hoodie for my husband, but he put it on, and while the body fit, the shoulder area was tight. He is not a huge muscle guy, I’d say he has a medium build, and yet the shoulders were very uncomfortable on him. For me, it is great. It might be a bit long like menswear is, but the body, the arms, the pockets, everything fits me well. I really like the sleeve design with the gathering, it looks really cool."
4.0,"It's my new favorite shirt, it's really hard for me to buy clothes that fit, the only down side is that one little piece in the back keeps itching me but when I wear it for a while it doesn't bother me as much."
4.0,"Sleeves to last the knuckles of my hand, material is a bit bulky, but warm. If you're looking for style, this is not the jacket for you. But if you're looking for something functional, this is a good bet."
4.0,"It’s not the red I was expecting, more orange-y.  It took me a while to figure out the loosen/tighten mechanism.  I like that the length can be adjusted."
4.0,I like the design and quality of materials used.  so far is holding in good shape and have even received some compliments . my only complaint is the lack of seconds needle. I didn't notice it when ordered it but is not a big deal considering the price and the fact that it is well manufactured mechanical watch.
4.0,"Nice shirt, nice feel to the body, the only concern i have after receiving it and trying it on, is the size small on me is too loose, i am not skinny, wear bra size 34 B, and it was way too loose fitting  for me in the area, and also in the waist area, however in the area of arms it was ok, not loose.<br />Also i am concerned what fabric paint they color with, because the smell is kind of off for me, though this supposed to be an Eco conscious brand,  i suppose, and they use bamboo fibers,and i hope they use toxic free color. I am returning this item due to two concerns i described above, i will look into this company further, and after my research, might will consider buying white shirt instead of black."
4.0,I got the blue plaid. It is a cute shirt and I will keep it but it is very shiny giving it a bit of a cheap look and it is a bit see through. I would wear a tank under it.
4.0,"Nice clutch, doesn't hold much, expect to get glitter on you."
4.0,"This is good, solid, cotton underwear, but runs large. Consider ordering a size down. I like these, but do feel like I'm wearing granny pants - LOL!"
4.0,"I’ve used these a few dozen times while chainsawing, stacking wood, chipping or dragging off branches as well as changing and sharpening chains many dozens of times.  They are holding up as well as I’d expect.  The only improvement that could be made is to also use a kevlar stitching on the fingertips with overlaps so that it doesn’t fray so easily and peel."
4.0,"These are nice insoles.  They didn't give my feet the relief for as long of period as I would have liked, but it may just be my feet."
4.0,Love the look but runs a little smaller in sizes
4.0,Cute! Needs a cami and slip underneath though. The material is see through an did not cover enough of my cleavage. But it's very pretty and I got a lot of compliments at work.
4.0,They are good products
4.0,Nice and bit small
4.0,Thick pants that keep you warm on cooler days.
4.0,A lot of room. made well.
4.0,"I have a jewelry business and I've have many parents tell me the lollipop has fallen off! I understand little girls can be rough, however I feel as though I was replacing charms once I sell them. They should be on tighter! Would recommend because they are cute!"
4.0,"Nice classy looking belt that can be worn with jeans or work pants, the buckle is nice as well. The underside looks like real leather however it looks like the type of belt that after repeated use of using the same punch holes it will start to break at that point. As can be seen from the creases in the picture. Fairly satisfied"
4.0,"I bought these for my Mum, she wears a size 10 normally.  Since it suggests ordering large I bought a size 11.  They were too small for her.  I wear a size 9 and they fit me comfortably if a little loose in the heel.  It works for me since I do not walk, but I would say order at least a size and a half larger than your foot.  Otherwise hey are comfortable well made shoes. The weave is light enough for the heat of summer, but warm enough with tights or socks for spring or fall.  I think I'll get good use out of them although I wasn't planning on having new shoes."
4.0,"It does the job! Although it's thin, I still love it because it provides an extra layer of protection from any dust, bugs or debris that kicks up from the road. It sometimes ride down my face but nothing I can't handle."
4.0,For price I would buy again.  Couldn’t justify paying $70 for garmin brand leather band!
4.0,Love look and color of this purse. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is the purse is a bit too big for me personally v
4.0,"Like the closure on this necklace. It is a bit stiff though, so it doesn't just lay on your neck."
4.0,"I like it but don't love it. On one hand it is very well made and the wider band as well as extender offered with the larger size gives the bra a very high quality feel. And it does well to bring things ""up"". It's just the final look / shape is a bit odd."
4.0,"This dress is just a bit low-cut for the office, but a draped scarf fixes that. The color is more of a soft raspberry than wine or burgundy, but I like the color. I love the soft fabric, the ruching, and the cut. The double layer makes it possible to wear it without serious foundation garments. Looks fabulous with some sassy heels and jewelry! I also bought one in black, and I'm as happy with it as I am with this one!"
4.0,It's a very nice looking necklace! I hope it stays this way!
4.0,"THE JACKET FITS AS EXPECTED, BUT I HAVE SOME CHUBBY ARMS SO IT IS A LITTLE TIGHT AROUND THE ARMS."
4.0,"Nothing wrong with these bales, but they are smaller than I envisioned. The eye for stringing is particularly small and can be used for stringing with leather or linen cord or a fine chain. Couldn't use lobster claw type findings."
4.0,Fits but a little tight
4.0,"Few reasons for a 4 star review:<br />-the date seems to advance so quickly on its own making you think it's tomorrow's date today. I tried fidgeting it to work better by adjusting the time but no luck.<br />-the leather band it came with appeared old and worn out. Not the kind of band that complements the watch, so I bought a separate blue leather alligator one elsewhere."
4.0,"This zip-up hoodie is not too thick & heavy so it’s perfect for Fall/Autumn, and layering during the winter months. It isn’t lined so what you see is what you get. The zipper function as it should & I really love the zippered pockets - perfect for storing keys & wallet when you’re on the go. My husband is 5’7” & usually wears size Medium. This hoodie in size Medium is comfy & true to its size however, the sleeves are rather long (see pic). The design should have included sleeve cuffs to avoid this invisible hand look, in my opinion. Other than that, this hoodie serves its purpose & keeps my husband warm during cooler months. This design can be worn by women too so I think I’ll borrow it from my husband every now & then. :) I hope my honest review with pics can assist you in your decision making."
4.0,These were a gift for a friend who started her first garden this summer. They are whimsical and practical. What's not to like?
4.0,"I love the swimsuit but the top is slightly large on me, that’s nothing that can’t be fixed with a little sewing though. the bottoms fit very nicely!"
4.0,Very cute shirt but it's more for Fall season. Type thick for this humidity.
4.0,Came as pictured.  Overall happy with purchase.
4.0,Huge on my head but warm and functional.
4.0,Great dress very long though that is why 4 stars
4.0,"I got two of these, one for me and one for my best friend. They are great for any occation. I love the black finish and tribal look."
4.0,"These boots are really cute.  I did as other customers suggested and ordered a half size up and I was glad I did.  Normally I wear a size 8 1/2 and I ordered a 9.  My feet get cold easily so I will want to wear thick socks.  Also, there isn't much padding on the insoles.  I will probably add an insole.  Otherwise they are pretty comfortable.  And, yes, the plaid side panels do look a little plasticky and shiny but that didn't bother me."
4.0,"Some of the threading on the bottom hem came out after the first wash but after fixing that, it's stayed deep in color, buttons have stayed on after multiple washes & overall quality is really good."
4.0,Seem to be very comfortable. I am on my feet for 10-12 hour work days and towards the end of the day my feet definitely tell me it's too much. These seem to help so far. The package I ordered was the three pair and only one arrived. Amazon credited me the difference though. Definitely recommend the product just make sure you get what you ordered.
4.0,I purchased the xxxl in hopes of getting the perfect size based off reviews. The swim suit looks exactly how it is pictured. However the top is slightly too small. I have minor spillage. The bottoms fit ok and the suit overall looks nice.
4.0,Fits well & comfortable. Use it daily for computer work
4.0,Not for people with a thin nose. Keeps sliding down.
4.0,Quality and delivered quickly. Very nice
4.0,"The leather feels real, it's rugged and not poor quality, and the stone-washed texture and color of the jeans is attractive. That said, the pants did run a little large, which surprised me since they're coming from Asia (where American buyers expect we must order several sizes up). It's hard to tell what is what these days, especially online. That's why I gave it a 4/5 stars. I usually wear 32/32, but I ordered the 33 just in case.<br /><br />What I did in order to solve the problem was take it to a tailor and have it resized. It cost $38 to keep the original hem, but the jeans look weird if you just fold the bottom in and sew it shut. And it's cheaper than sending it back to Asia, pay for shipping twice for the exchange, then wait for 30 days for a new one to come back and not really know if it's going to fit either.<br /><br />SO, it's all right now! Fits great, feels real, and is a pair of high-quality durable pants."
4.0,It was little contricting so it got a mild alteration and it was fabulous. I gave as a gift.
4.0,"Great purchase. Warm, soft. It states that it is loose fitting, it definitely is. Would recommend not sizing up."
4.0,"The material is light weight but durable. The bottoms fit perfectly, but the top was too large, which I figured was going to happen, but they should still give the ability to mix and match on the sizes"
4.0,I like the fabric!  Like the stretch and the pockets!
4.0,"Overall, these seem to be well made and comfortable. Two things to consider: They run a little on the large side and the rise is long."
4.0,"They are great for a fun night or change of look. Only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because it itches my nose when I wear it. Maybe I should get used to them. Anyway, that is the ONLY reason i do not give it 5 starts."
4.0,Overall fits well. The waist was a little big but all pants for her that way.
4.0,"Nice and roomy, I wish I would have thought about if there were any pockets as there aren’t any & having at least one inside would be nice"
4.0,The fabric used for the dark one is not as soft as the others.
4.0,Just right ;material is not really the good one but it will do.
4.0,Possibly mens sizing
4.0,Really good quality and gorgeous but a bit loose. I'm 5'2&#34; and 105 pounds and the small was loose on me. I love the dress so I'm going to get it fitted and such. Just be aware that the sizes run a bit big 😊
4.0,"While it hasn't yet been washed, when given to my granddaughter it fit perfectland looked good."
4.0,"These fit a bit large on me, but still wearable.  Not sure I would trust them with a big wave or water slide."
4.0,My husband had sent me the link to this hat on his Christmas list. It's exactly what is pictured here. Quality seems good. We will see how the hubby likes it on Christmas day!
4.0,"The glasses are a little big on the face, so if you're looking for that cutesy kind of look I say go for it!"
4.0,"Cute pants but as you can see in the picture the buttons are fake and don’t close the pocket, I was under the impression that they did. That’s basically the only bad part."
4.0,"Nice and do the job but be aware: the wind go thru the hoodie so when come a freezing wing, thing about something else!"
4.0,"Overall, these are very good sports bras for kids. My eldest daughter loves them. My girls are eight and six and the same size for both. They’re stretchy enough to fit my eldest comfortably, but still snug enough for my younger daughter.<br /><br />My complaint comes from my younger daughter. These are slightly scratchy and she will not wear them. She is sensitive to clothing textures, but I thought these would be safe.<br /><br />If you have a child with tactile sensitivities, these may be problematic. I recommend looking for different sports bras that are primarily cotton."
4.0,I liked the watch band but it was the wrong size I needed a 45mm size for my Apple series 8 watch and I love the color red so I hope that you have it in the 45mm size and in red I sent it back so I am waiting to see
4.0,My daughter is a young adult but loves this onesie. It's a good fit too
4.0,"Really nice watch, but the braceleit is cheap"
4.0,The bracelet was as shown and described. I a very pleased with it.
4.0,"Super cute, can keep on and wear constantly but very hard to get out of ears. Def stay in!"
4.0,"Liked the feel, softness & no seams, just needed to be sized right!"
4.0,"This is a cute, simple, comfortable dress. I Took pictures to show how it looked from different angles. I am wearing a small. Love the color and the material! A scarf would be cute to wear with it too."
4.0,"I love the softness of the product, but really could use a size larger. With all the comments about running larger, I tried going with the recommendations. I didn't want to mess with trying to exchange, but would adjust up if I purchased again."
4.0,I really liked this necklace! I got this to wear to my cousin's wedding - for which the theme was Game of Thrones. The only reason that I didn't give this necklace 5 stars was because of the chain. I didn't like how big the chain was so I just switched it out for one of my smaller ones. That worked better because I felt the bigger chain took the attention away from the flower.
4.0,Color is not as dark as shown but is nice for spring. The Thick black plastic tag CANT  be removed without tearing therefore I tucked Big Thick Black Tag Down inside & it gaps out!
4.0,"haven't tested it's durability yet, but the pendant is great! the cable chain isn't really that great, however. i would suggest getting the cord or bead chain instead; assuming those are the same quality as a regular cord/bead chain."
4.0,"Nice leotard, but this runs very small. Definitely order up at least one size, maybe two sizes."
4.0,It shrunk a little after the first wash but that's my only complaint.
4.0,Very nice top!  Fit for a slender petite person!
4.0,Nice variety. I took the beads off of some of them so it wouldn't be too repetitive. They have a nice texture and aren't itchy like some of my other chokers.<br /><br />However: I have a normal sized neck and I need to wear these on the longest setting. Like... literally the last loop of the chain. So definitely not suited for necks of all sizes.
4.0,This was a Christmas gift that was received well
4.0,I bought the boots to wear with several different outfits and they finish the outfits perfectly.  In my rating of the product I did not count off for no arch support since I knew ahead of time there was none.  The reason for the 4 rating is because of the zipper. Very difficulty to zip up.
4.0,"But it costed 3.89, shipped for free from China and only took 3 weeks to get here. AND its really not bad looking. The band feels cheap and if closely inspected the watch is obviously made on an extremely low budget. BUT if your going out or partaking in a situation where a classy look would do good, this is by far unbeatable. I literally had someone say to me the other day &#34; your b***hing about money problems but your walking around with a movado on?&#34;.. Sure it stopped ticking twice and I had to give it a little hit, so what? Im not really using it for time. Let's be honest we're all looking at this watch for the same reason, low cost but expensive looks, not functionality. If you think this is an every day wear watch I suggest you spend more money and get something better"
4.0,Dress fits nice and has great flow. I receive compliments every time I wear it. First time I washed it half of the tassel came off. I would maybe order this dress again but it's not really my style. I ordered a size medium and am 5'8&#34; 135# 34C.
4.0,"Mom survived her battle with breast cancer; however, she lost a tremendous amount of weight.  Her fingers are extremely thin.  Because she has a fear of losing her expensive gold-and-diamond rings, she has turned to wearing gorgeous necklaces in order to satisfy her sweet tooth for luxurious bling.  For her birthday, I requested the black teardrop pendant (Silver Night 925) from LADY COLOUR.  It is definitely intended for a lady with a taste for color and beauty.  I love the black teardrop design.  Its multifaceted planes shine and shimmer and glisten when worn.  The teardrop alone is gorgeous.  However, this pendant also has a leaf embedded with white Swarovski crystals.  The leaf's stem is connected to the pendant's large loop through which the chain passes.  I wish the chain was much thicker and stronger.  It looks thin and weak.  I'm afraid it might easily break.<br /><br />  The 17.7-inch chain has a 1.97-inch extension with a tiny heart attached to it.  One day, I may replace this chain with a more expensive one.  For right now, it is fine.  The chain has a large, round clasp that looks durable enough not to break over time.  My mom only wears the pendant when she dines at a nice restaurant and attends church services on Sunday morning.  The LADY COLOUR black teardrop pendant looks very elegant and Mom was very thankful and appreciative to receive it.  The pendant arrived in a nice square box with a cardboard slip cover.  Inside the box, which is perfect for gift wrapping and for future storage, is a tiny cleaning cloth and a warranty card.  (I didn't see a card of authenticity.)  On the back of the warranty card are maintenance tips depicted with symbols.  Therefore, I am only guessing as to what they mean.  I wish the company had included more specific care instructions on actual paper.<br /><br />  There are, however, care instructions on Amazon's website.  Basically, don't spray perfume or harsh chemicals on the pendant, don't get sweat on it, don't get it wet (don't take a bath or shower while wearing it), avoid rubbing it against hard objects that might scratch it, and don't go to bed while still wearing it.  You can clean it with baby wipes.  This pendant sounds fragile.  One must be careful while wearing it.  Nevertheless, it is beautiful, elegant, and unique.  It looks expensive, but isn't.  My suggestion is that if you like it, purchase a sturdier, more expensive chain; only wear it on special occasions; and be very careful when you do wear it.  I think it looks great with most any outfit that consists of dark earth colors such as black, navy blue, forest green, chocolate brown, etc.  It would make a great gift for any holiday or special occasion.  I would wear it myself but it looks too feminine for my tastes."
4.0,"Boots are pretty well made other then the zippers. I believe they are for looks because not a single one will work, even with pliers. Time will tell if then hold up being used in a haunted house."
4.0,"(Reviewed by my wife): This is a really cute watch.  I have a lot of watches, but none with a white strap.  This one definitely stands out.  The white looks great with the gold color and the faux diamonds.  The strap is a belt-type strap so it is easy to adjust with no need to remove links.  It keeps time perfectly and is well made."
4.0,A mi esposa le gusto mucho
4.0,Short and badly cut. Cheap material. Not like the picture. I'm only 5'5 and it's short on me.<br />They refunded my payment very good customer service!
4.0,I really like my scarve!  It's pretty!  the material feels soft and it looks expensive!  I wore it to a 4th of July party and I was surprised of how many compliments I got.  Make me feel proud to wear our country's flag in this beautiful well made scarve.
4.0,"I got two different bras from the same company and they each fit a little large, which surprised me, given that I fit into other bras of this size. They were both loose. Additionally, there is itching and it is really irritating. This bra had thread issues, that caused itching, but also a fabric issue. Overall, it isn't a terrible design but it wasn't comfortable and I need bras that are comfortable. It is a nice bra and would work for many, but if your skin is sensitive you won't like it as much and it appears to run a little large."
4.0,I did like this product but the tire part of it was kind of bothersome I don’t think I order something like that again
4.0,"I like it but the sizing is off. I wear a US size 5.5 and the large was tight on me at first. Other than that, it gets the job done while I work out."
4.0,"Cute, but fabric is weird and smells funky."
4.0,"Love the dress but hangs a little too low under the arms, considering altering it slightly to snug it up a little."
4.0,it was nice jacket great material. It was just the wrong sizes.
4.0,"Different, very nice"
4.0,"Bought this for my 12 yr old daughter, and had to go from a small to a large. This crop top is very small! Even for a crop top, it’s very small. I would recommend ordering a size or two larger."
4.0,"I have tried a few different bands to replace the sweat catcher OEM silicone like bands that are supposed to be easy to use.  There is no contest, this band, not leather, but not abrasive, or aggravating to the skin.  It is easy to buckle, even one handed.  It doesn't inhibit the functions of the watch.  If this ever wears out before the watch is outdated, I'll order a replacement."
4.0,Awesome bands and fit perfect
4.0,It is a really nice skirt fit great....I think it fits as expected I cannot really tell as I usually wear small but I think I have been loosing some weight so it is just right not uncomfortable at all....great job sell however I bought 4 on my last Purchase and you sent 3 in a package and 1 by itself which did not make much sense and it cost me another item to clear..if I do purchase again can you please add ALL IN ONE PACKAGE thanks much
4.0,I bought one for my sister and one for me.  It's very fragile looking but cute.
4.0,Love thiys. Bag.  Would have given it a 5 except it has all chemical smell.
4.0,"For the price, these are great sunglasses. I used them in Florida and they were great for glare off the water and the beach. Stylish look and large enough to cover your eyes so you don't get glare from around the edges. I would buy these again<br /><br />Update:  I have decided that while I really like these for use around the water, I do not like them for driving really long distances. There is something about them that alters how I feel on the road for really long trips. Otherwise still great glasses."
4.0,"My daughter loved them. They fit well, feel good, and are just her style. Only problem was when she pulled them up while holding the belt loops, it ripped very easily. Lucky, we both sew."
4.0,The mask fit my husband perfectly but was a little big on me. It kept sliding down my nose.
4.0,The part between the legs seems to be a little narrower than older versions. Well made and colorfast.
4.0,Very nice necklace. Adjustable. The ring is really big but it makes a cool decoratin.
4.0,Bigger than expected. My friend has one and it's a bit smaller but it's perfect for what I need! I love it
4.0,I like my dress .it fit just above my knee. fit me close I am 170lbs and 5&#34;6.the material is good I love it.
4.0,Must see it to believe it!<br />Just wish it was a half inch bigger.<br />It’s a little difficult to get over he hand and I have small to avg hands. So taking off 1 star.<br />Just purchased two more. One for my daughter & one more for me to layer with my first.
4.0,"Good Product! Others gave sizing poor reviews. The circumference wasn’t where I found a flaw, but the width. It began to hurt bending my knuckle, I drive a metro bus 8-11 hours a day so I put a lot of wear on my hand. If sizing the width becomes possible it would make it much more comfortable."
4.0,This piece is adorable.  It came packaged and looking clean.  I'm able to adjust the size without it falling apart. It doesn't feel like it will stay though.  I might lose it.
4.0,"I needed a very light, cheap! jacket for travel...this was perfect! cheap! warm! compact! Not a fashion accessory, but very functional!"
4.0,"I love these shirts. They’re soft, thin and stretchy but not too sheer. They fit snugly but not skin tight."
4.0,For my wife....<br />No public comment!!
4.0,"Zippers work well, plenty of easy access to card slots"
4.0,"The Kongol 507 hats are supremely nice to wear, feel nice, and are nice to look at. People, unknown to me, compliment my Kongol 507s whenever I wear them outside of home. My only quibble is that they’re probably overpriced by about $5 More than the company needs them to be."
4.0,Feels well and comfortable.
4.0,"The jumpsuit is very flattering but there are no belt loops to hold the belt in place, so because of the material, it slips past the seem."
4.0,They look nothing like the picture but I do like the socks I got so it’s a win I guess. Just be warned that they’re not going to look like that.
4.0,Super cute but is very small
4.0,"These shorts seem okay.  Two front pockets and one Velcro closure back pocket.  These are not quite as flexible as a similar pair from another brand which are intended as swim trunks.  The listing here says ""Workout Gym Beach"", but these don't have the flex of most workout wear.  They will still work for that however, and they will work as swim trunks.<br /><br />Where you have to be careful is in the sizing.  I wear a medium in pretty much all types of shorts like this, but I ordered a large based on other buyers feedback and based on the possibility these were sized for Asian men.  It turns out that on the tag of the shorts I received, it shows Large for Asia, Medium for Europe, and Small for the U.S.  So I got a small, and so the fit is tight.  I can wear them, and I guess the tightness is a hint to lose some weight.  If you normally wear a U.S. medium size, I suggest that you opt for an extra large."
4.0,I do like it but it doesn't stay tight enough on your wrist.
4.0,"Very lightweight shoe.  There isn't a lot of  side support but if you lace it up snuggly it's okay.  The colors are bright, just like the picture.  I've had these shoes for a couple months and they are holding up so far, although I don't wear them daily."
4.0,"I've been trying to find some comfy post-baby panties, & I have been happy with these. I was a size 12-14 pre-baby, & I'm now probably, regretably, closer to a 16 now. The large fits comfortably & seems forgiving of the dreaded below-the-belly-button-bulge. Occasionally, they ride down, but not terribly so. Also, they're quite soft."
4.0,"I like it; however, its fabric is too thin"
4.0,"I am tall (5'10&#34;) so this fit more like a long shirt than a tunic dress but's that's what I expected so I am still happy with it. I wish the sleeves were a little longer but, again, something I am not surprised about because of my height. I will just scrunch the sleeves a bit to be more like a 3/4 sleeve. Very cute and comfy!"
4.0,"It's really light, incredibly warm, and soft! The lining is a bit cheap looking/feeling, but who cares what others can't see right!? I absolutely LOVE this jacket!"
4.0,"Ordered in the XL (size 16ish) and the dress fit well. Loved the skirt being a thicker material and the top has some stretch. Drop waist dresses are really a hit or miss on my body top. This one was great, except for the pockets. They stick out when I have the dress on and I can't seem to get them to sit flat. Disappointing, because I wanted to wear this to an event. I'd try the next size up, but they don't have it in the pattern I liked."
4.0,Does relieve pain and almost lets me feel like my barefoot in the house days are back.
4.0,"Very nice but heavier in weight than my winter fleece robe - but that was to be expected.<br />Fits well, color true to picture."
4.0,"I love the fit of this shirt, as well as the drape.  I don't like the neck because it is a bit too t-shirty looking and doesn't dress up as much as I thought it would.  A necklace certainly helps.  Outside of that, it's the perfect date shirt and great for events that require upscale casual."
4.0,"The dress fits as expected.  The stitching is slightly pulled, but that may be because of the material. The bodice is plain, so I will need to accessorize with something black.  The dress is perfect for a nice spring evening."
4.0,"I thought it would have been a darker color silver, other than that it's great"
4.0,Material feels cheap but that’s expected for the price. Sturdy and gets the job done.
4.0,I’m looking forward to it fitting better after I drop some weight
4.0,[[VIDEOID:202321e1bfe67ad9ce443732d9611579]] Added a little rhinestone to it but cute for the day
4.0,A Quality product with a continued reputation of craftsmanship.
4.0,I really like this bra but the fit is off on me. My puppies squeeze together no shape or form. Sucks because I really like it but I'm always adjusting my puppies. Lol
4.0,Just to small for 13 year old
4.0,"Great watch, got complements throughout prom, easy to use, beautiful design, battery lasts long, it did count the minutes a little faster when I first got it but if you shake it really hard (how it charges) it fixes the issue, but overall a great watch."
4.0,"Only thing I didn’t expect is that they are a little thicker material than I expected for warmer weather, and you aren’t supposed to put them in the dryer. Otherwise they are nice."
4.0,"Great product for price, works well. Only issue is sometimes i find bits of stitching/string coming lose. I just cut it off and it has no effect on the functionality of the sleeves. Would buy again."
4.0,This tank is flattering on. I love it for the price!
4.0,This is a gorgeous dress and it looks elegant and nice. My only complaint is that it should come with something for the boob area to make sure it doesn't just open up if you move too much.. I have to use it with a pin and that could be prevented by adding a tiny fastener
4.0,This is a good quality sports bra! If you have more to deal with it might not work for you during a high power work out! It’s perfect for activities like yoga and Pilates though!
4.0,"satisfactory quality, but not the best."
4.0,love it. Little bigger than expected.
4.0,I usually wear a small but this runs small. It is very fitted. I ordered the medium and it is still very snug. I like the color and it's great for the gym. Order  a size or 2 up!
4.0,"Water shoes were nice.  Grandson loved them,  a little big but he can grow into them."
4.0,"Fit smaller than expected, and was unable to return it"
4.0,"Very Cute.  I like this headband.  It is comfortable and easy to wear.  The flower is a little cheap looking, but when it is in the hair it is very cute.  The only problem I have with it is that it is hard to store.  I have it sitting on my dresser but it keeps drooping.  I don't want to flower to set in that position."
4.0,Gloves were a little to small
4.0,love it!!!!  for the price is very good👍👍👍👍
4.0,"Cute and very light weight! A little smaller than I thought they would be, but I can work with that"
4.0,"Love this cup! I work 10 hour days and an hour each way. A nice size that fits in my lunch box, and keeps it hot/warm most of the day, which I'm happy with. After all, I don't want to burn my mouth on it and want it to cool some. I use it for broth so I don't refill it at all once I leave home. 9 hours later and still warm enough to finish. The only reason I didn't give a 5 star is because some of the paint came off trying to scrub off the sticky from the sticker. But that doesn't affect the  cup from keeping my broth warm lol. Definitely worth the price in my opinion"
4.0,"I was pleasantly surprised by this suit. It's a pretty inexpensive price, so I wasn't expecting anything fantastic. The fit is true to size. I ordered a large. I am 5'4&#34; & 140 lbs. The quality of material is nice & thick. the bottoms are lined in the front & the top has bra cups, but not thick pads. Which I appreciate. I will definitely order other styles!"
4.0,Was cool
4.0,Glad it fit good and was cute. Perfect for these triple digit days
4.0,"I just got my dress and it is beautiful,haven't tryed it on yet but it's beautiful😊"
4.0,"Loved it ,very comfortable,I feel like I have nothing on and it takes me two minutes to put it on.the only downside to it the material is a little bit too stretchy"
4.0,The top is very short. Runs a little small. Not a fan of the material.
4.0,"Light weight , fashionable, cute. Love it. 4 stars because there was a tiny tiny crack when I opened the package other then that so worth the price"
4.0,"I'm not into fancy belts, but this really helped me to perfect my Halloween costume! It's sad that it doesn't come in gold, though. And I am not to fond of the design of how it clips in the back, too many links! So I cut them off with wire cutters!"
4.0,"This is a solid product, but the sizing is a bit off. Order a size bigger than you need! I’ve had mine at a 2g for around 3 years now and the 2g’s I first ordered would have fallen out at the slightest touch. I reordered the 0g and while a tad bit too big, they popped right in without much pain."
4.0,This is a birthday gift for my friend and she really likes it.
4.0,Very nice purse. I got several compliments on it.  I took longer than expected to come in. Just as pictured. The only complaint I have is that the metal blingy tassel that came on it was very cheap and started falling off as soon as I got it.
4.0,"This is obviously costume jewelery so fairly cheap in materials, but it is still really cute. As long as you only plan to wear it on occasion it works out great. If you were to wear it quite often I would be afraid that it would fall apart."
4.0,"As others mentioned, it does come with a strong odor. Hopefully after letting it air out, the smell will dissipate. Other than that, its a good size and looks as pictured."
4.0,Super comfy and warm. Was able to be outside in 30 degree weather and stay comfortable. Only downside is that holes formed in the butt/crotch area and underarm area after first time of wear.
4.0,Great material feels great on!
4.0,"Cute top, Will work for what I need.  The picture shows it to the knee of what looks to be a tall slender woman but it was more like mid-thigh on me and I am only 5'3&#34; and don't really have a long torso - but it covered my rear and draped nicely in front so Ill keep it."
4.0,Using glasses after eye surgery to reduce glare from oncoming traffic and effective in that respect.
4.0,"I absolutely love it,I want to buy some more. The only thing that would make it perfect for me is if the strap length&#34; although is the best I have found so far&#34; where if the length could be around 4&#34; longer if possible. Like I said love it,would like more of them. Thank You for your product,and speedy delivery."
4.0,Really nice sunglasses bought them to get them fit for prescription not to heavy but bigger than i usually ware but i still liked them a lot
4.0,Nice and cute shirt.
4.0,Better than other socks I have bought
4.0,Nice material but thin.  The pink rose is a pretty color. This dress ran a size smaller than most of the other teeshirt dresses.<br />I usually order a small. But a medium would've been better.
4.0,"I bought this because I thought it would be nice to have a BB shirt with a pocket. The sleeves seem a bit short for a BB shirt. The sleeves on this shirt are a little above my elbow, while my other BB shirts sleeves are a little below my elbow. The shirt washed well (I take care not to let my shirts get too dry in a hot dryer) and the fabric is comfortable."
4.0,"Runs small, glittery skirt and sleeves. Photographs well."
4.0,This was fine. Fairly priced for what it is and can be dressed up or down.
4.0,Fits and looks great. Nice craftsmanship
4.0,"Really cute but it is a little thin in the cream, but not bad enough to wear a tank under the shirt."
4.0,Good quality..the red is not as vibrant as in the photo..its more brownish red. I still love it.
4.0,Great bracelet! AmorWing has amazing products!
4.0,Cute shirts. My daughter loves them. She is 2 but a pretty big toddler so can fit size 5.
4.0,Oerder for my daughters birthday party she loved it fits good
4.0,"This looks fantastic, but it does make the crown hard to use."
4.0,This was a beautiful Christmas gift that my girlfriend loved.<br />Came in before Christmas Even though shipping info wasn't sure.<br />The customized photo was very clear.<br />I didn't realize I was paying over $40 for shipping. Wow. Just wow!
4.0,Cheap materials used to make this bracelet watch band. It broke in less than a week. I am very careful with my items and take very good care of it. As I was removing it from my wrist it broke in to pieces. The clear stretch cord holding the beads on is cheap. To return the item I would have to pay shipping back. No worth it. Just know that the materials used to make this extremely cheap. Good for one week. Don’t waste your money. There are better quality here in amazon and this is not it.
4.0,"The only trouble my boyfriend has with it is that it doesn't keep time, I believe it's too slow, other than that its nice an small enough."
4.0,"received on time, product as described.  Flip up feature very convenient but shade could be darker."
4.0,"Great product, but no non slip protection"
4.0,Dress is very nice but it was way too big- thought my daughter would want it but it was even big on her! Going to skip this one!
4.0,Very cute and I love them and will keep them! Only weird thing is that they kinda turn to the side when in my ears
4.0,Super cute and great for play jewelry for kids.
4.0,"A basic design, a nice and simple feel. The belt piece is used to cinch it in the middle; technically, you can go without it, but it feels much larger and 'baggier' without it. However, that means you can cinch the waist to fit your body, instead of having a pre-cut design!"
4.0,Belt adds extra padding for a heavy belt. Only downside is that is rides up or down your waist after a while
4.0,"I had a coupon code towards part of this coat and decided to try it.  I was amazed by how it looked when we opened it.  My boyfriend is Latino and his eyes shot open.  I was worried because this was my first purchase for him.  The sleeves have zips on them, there's other  details on the upper arms of the sleeves.  The collar feels soft, and the zipper itself looked sturdy.  He usually wears a medium, but there were only had a few left.  He looked great and judging by the kiss and hugs I got.....he loved it too.  Will update if there's any issues others than normal wear and tear."
4.0,I really like the necklace.  Think it is pretty. Am wearing it no
4.0,My daughter loved them thank you very much.<br /><br />AM
4.0,"The costume is great! I'm usually a small but the crotch area was very tight so I had to size up. Medium fits well, the material is just very stretchy so I have a bit of extra room in the torso. It's very true to the pictures, but i will say the crown/tiara/headpiece makes the costume look very cheap and Halloween. If you're wanting this as a cosplay, definitely plan to purchase a separate headpiece."
4.0,"I bought these hoping they were somewhat compression. They aren't,  but they make amazing jammie tops. Will order more."
4.0,Nice color. Good fit. I was pleased
4.0,"Not bad, run a little small in size."
4.0,Little small but very pretty and a very good price
4.0,i bought and I get lots of compliments. it is cheap but still looks great.
4.0,Product was as described. Was delivered 4 days late
4.0,"If you’re a little bit shorter (like my fiancé) then I would recommend getting one size down. We got an XL and it was long for her, I think L would do the trick. Other then that product arrived and looks great."
4.0,"I should have ordered a smaller size as it fits a little loose but not overly large.  It does cover my tummy sticking out with the extra material.  I like the fit and actually it does not need a cover up.  All in all it was a good price, fast shipping and looks really cute."
4.0,I wouldn’t say it fits “small” but  definitely not true to size. I expected a long maxi dress as I am 5’3 but this is above my ankles
4.0,"These are really cute, I always get compliments on them.. but they do not actually block the sun!"
4.0,It was exactly what I was looking for when I purchased it.
4.0,"These are super cute, I get tons of compliments whenever I wear them. I bought them for a trip and was looking for something a bit unique but not too out there and these are just that! I wear them all the time and I love them! My only issue is that they are a little bit too big and sometimes slide down off my nose but that doesn't happen too often. Otherwise they are perfect!"
4.0,"Let me start by saying these earrings are very sparkly, high-quality, and beautiful. I purchased the purple ones for my 2.5 year old daughter and they are the perfect size. There are a couple of things I wish were different about the earrings:<br />-The security backs of these earrings are quite tiny. If you have chubby fingers, you may have a hard time putting them on a squirmy little one, or even on yourself. I advise being extra careful when screwing these on so as not to loose the tiny backing.<br />- Since the earring back is so small, the threading on the earring post also seems very short. When these loosen up, they are more likely to fall out and get lost if you wear for several days without making sure they are still tight.<br />I reordered these after they fell from my daughters ears and got lost.  I heasitated on reordering them but they really are beautiful and great quality. I just wish they were a little more secure and wouldnt get lost so easily."
4.0,"These are really pretty earrings. The ""turquoise"" and ""sapphire' stones combined with the silver-tone gives the earrings a southwest look.  I like the dangley length and they are not too heavy."
4.0,Nice strap. Really gave my IWC pilot chrono a nice classic look as compared to the original SS band
4.0,Yea. My grandma loves the set. Cant go wrong with this. Earrings has a little wieght. Grandma slept in them. Lol
4.0,It is a beautiful color. I can wear multiple colors with it to change up the look.
4.0,"I like these socks as far as comfort, and they do help keep my toes from getting blisters. They are somewhat difficult to put on, but after they are on, they're comfortable. I am concerned about the durability of these socks. I wore one pair only three or four times, washing in between each wearing, and already have a hole in the toe of one of the socks. Since I use these daily for five and a half mile walks, it's important that my socks last a little longer than this."
4.0,"I have wide feet and these worked perfectly for me.. The straps took a little time to adjust, but once it's all right they looked great! Super deal!!"
4.0,Love the color and the for of the dress and how soft the fabric is. Received tons of compliments.
4.0,"Just Great!  It is quite a bit smaller over all than in the picture, they must have used a child model ;-)"
4.0,Nice little necklace for a child. It was a bit overpriced in my opinion.
4.0,"I bought this for my daughter who is a petite 13 year old. I order the next size larger than she normally wears so she could have this for many years.<br /><br />When I removed this from the plastic bag and unfolded it, it looked way too big to be a medium. I’m 5’10 and 223 pounds and wear XL sometimes I can wear large clothing and I am able to wear this.. I’ve seen people say theirs was too small but this one is definitely the biggest medium I have ever seen.<br /><br />The hood itself though fit well when pulled over my head. I’ve had issues with other hoodies in the past that while using it felt uncomfortable and would pull the sweatshirt up from my lower back making me have to pull my sweatshirt back down. This hoodie doesn’t do that. The image quality is pretty darn good it is a good looking sweatshirt!<br /><br />The pocket is pretty small. I can barely put my hand inside which isn’t isn’t that big of a deal to me. The string on the hoodie is not of great quality.<br /><br />Instead of returning I will keep it for myself as it would be more trouble returning than it’s probably worth. I’m gonna look for a different sweatshirt somewhere else for my daughter as the small would still be much too big.<br /><br />The red sweatshirt in the photo is for size comparison it is a large vs the medium I purchased. The arms are very long on this sweatshirt.<br /><br />I hope this review helps folks!"
4.0,"Size Matter, I am 5' 7"" 189 lbs. a little gut.  I wear a men's Large and I had to send it back to get a XXL and still that seems a bit small for me.<br />I believe these jersey are cut to fit a slim person.  So you may want to order 2 sizes bigger. It so a good Jersey in all.  Go Kap!"
4.0,"Beautiful, only con was a few of the pendants we're chipped and or broken in transit."
4.0,Perfect size and feels great!
4.0,I loved the dress but may return if I can't get the zipper down.  I pulled over my head. Great material and fit.
4.0,I went up a size as you have to do with a lot of stuff on Amazon. While it fits almost perfectly I have extra fabric in my stomach area. I have a gut.... Thanks to having kids so I def didn't expect to have any loose fabric in that area... Thought it would be the opposite. Overall I like it. It looks like the pic. Easy to put on.... Using the bathroom while out won't be fun as it is with all rompers 😂😂😂. I'd recommend it. I'll add pics when I wear it Friday.
4.0,"Great product, fast Delivery, and I am very happy with it. I was looking for something to catch my eye when looking for my luggage and found this. Great ideal for a very affordable price."
4.0,Good quality but the dress ran very large so I had to take it back.
4.0,"It might just be me, but the thicker seam under the panel sits just right and it feels like your crack is hanging out. Other than that they’re nice, big side pockets which are a big bonus!"
4.0,"it is pretty small, and the cutout straps wrinkle a little bit on me (I'm a size 32A) other than that it was great."
4.0,"It's just a smidge tight for M, and the side was a little long. But overall it's a great dress, I will still be wearing it, I love it!!"
4.0,"I purchased the earrings for my wife, who saw a pair like them on a cruise for better than double the price."
4.0,"I order this for my 2 year old to wear on vacation with a pink shirt. The way the tie I received is done you can only see 4 of the same dinosaur, not the cute multiple colored dinosaurs like in the picture and not the pink one to match the pink shirt I have planned. Hoping exchanging for a different one will get me a new pattern. It is very well made and adorable."
4.0,Super cute but really thin. Definitely have to wear a sweater underneath.
4.0,"Super fast shipping. Did 2 day shipping and recieved in 1.<br /><br />Feel these would be perfect for hunting season as a bottom layer. Or as a bottom layer under heavier pants such as jeans for those who work outside. They are warm yet thin, have pockets which is a huge plus!<br /><br />The closed off ankle making them fitted to the ankles work awesome for having being tucked into boots or setting on top of tennis shoes.<br /><br />These also are good workout pants. The drawstring so you can make sure they stay up while running/jogging. Also the cuffed bottoms  ensure youwont be walking/tripping over long pants which work perfect for a short person as myself.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I recieved this at a free or discounted price in exchange for my honest review."
4.0,This costume was the perfect edition to my Hocus Pocus Trunk or Treat theme. The quality was great for a costume and I received lots of compliments. The jewelry that came with it was very pretty. I would give the costume five stars but I wasn’t a fan of the sleeves. It was almost perfect! Delivery was very quick and the costume was well packaged.
4.0,They're a bit of a tight fit but besides that everything else is just fine.
4.0,"Wear really fast, but soft and super warm."
4.0,"Good fit, fabric a little thin."
4.0,"Really cute, unique top. I did thank the top (medium) was a little large (I'm 36C).<br />This is a &#34;slide over your head&#34; top, but I haven't found that to be an issue."
4.0,"Shipping good.  Packaging good.  In retrospect, I wish it was the official aperture logo of someone running through the portal instead of just falling through, but that's what I get for going cheap."
4.0,"Simple design shirt, but that's not a bad thing. Fabric quality seems a little lower than expected but it still seems like it will last. Great price for the item and shipping is prompt. Also seems to run a bit small size wise, so ordering one size larger than your normal one may be a good move."
4.0,"My girlfriend ordered these - Definitely order a size up from your regular size, other than that it was nice and light and nice looking. Have not yet washed it."
4.0,Kind of larg for xs<br />But nice design and color
4.0,lighweight and attractive
4.0,This photo shows a deep cross over while in reality this hangs almost horizontal with the bottom.  It was an odd drape but for $8 I will keep it.
4.0,No filter
4.0,A very good fan and love that it’s usb but did not come with a lock ring
4.0,"The green is Packer green, not Seahawk green. Material is the first that I've found that can stretch to fit my 7 3/4&#34; head just okay. That also, though, makes it loose enough that the ball hitting my car ceiling and door jamb makes me readjust it."
4.0,"Im pretty sure i ordered the one with the waffle face but either way it looks beautiful, unfortunately only down side is the links determine if its tight or too loose"
4.0,It was shorter than epe.  But I like it.
4.0,These are of nice quality and good sunglasses but I don’t think these are polarized wish they had polarized glasses
4.0,Ordering a second.
4.0,Cute swim dress!  Fits as expected.
4.0,"Works great but there were a few items that it didnt hold as well as i thought it would, the appliances that i used it on were of a few different materials and the lighter materials held great but the denser and heavier items i had to reapply a few times over a 4 hour period at a convention.  Would totally recommend for most things but if you have a heavy piece probably best to find a more semi permanent bond."
4.0,"I've been looking around for a concealed carry purse off and on fora while. They are either too big, or just plain ugly or way too expensive. So when I saw this one at such a good price and the leather looked good quality, I thought I'd give it a try.I'm glad I did!.The leather is soft and supple and great quality. The bag is just large enough to hold everything I want to carry. There are two open pockets inside and one zippered pocket. The interior lining is black, silky normal purse lining material and feels like it will be durable. On the outside there are two pockets at each end of the purse perfect for holding things I need easy access to like my phone and lipstick.There is a zippered pocket on the outside opposite the pocket for my handgun.<br />The ONLY reason I didn't rate the purse five stars is because the pocket for my gun seems a little small to me. I can fit my Smith & Wesson 38 Special just fine...snug, but it should be good if I need to draw the gun.My Kahr CWP 9mm is just too long to fit. It's ok with me because I don't really carry it, but it would be nice to have the option.There are zippers on both sides of the gun pocket and there are two zipper pulls on each side so you can use a lock to secure them and can choose to zip up or down for access. The pocket has a holster that velcros to the inside of the gun pocket and keeps it safe and secure.<br />Overall, I would enthusiastically recommend the bag. It's good looking enough to carry with day or evening.<br />I received this bag at a discount in return for an honest review."
4.0,"They run a little on the small side. I'm glad I went a size bigger. Otherwise they do the job. I feel they are a little high priced for the quality, but should last long enough for my boys to outgrow them."
4.0,Really liked it but too big. Felt like I was wearing a bathrobe. Soft and good quality. Size down.
4.0,This is a nice necklace
4.0,"Love the Sunhats more, I love them all"
4.0,"For someone who loses nose rings as much as I do, this is a great product. You get a lot of rings with multiple different colors. They are a very small size though"
4.0,"These are lovely. I have them in black and gray and love them! The material on these is pretty thin and my feet are wide so I see it potentially looking bad but for now, they look great."
4.0,Very elegant and versatile alot of good complements a very happy with this purchase
4.0,Top opening sits higher on me than on model.  Material looks cheap.  So this whole thing looked very cheap on me.  Maybe buy if you want a very casual top.
4.0,"This is a beautiful mask, though I feel a bit claustrophobic in it. :)"
4.0,"I love these kinds of gloves! they fit, they work, no issues so far, and they are comfy. Only thing of note is that I have fat fingers, and the finger holes are slightly tighter that I expected."
4.0,The reason this is so big is that it is a plus size.  I missed that in the description.  Ordered a medium & reordered a small. Small fits well.  5’2” and it hits above the knee. 34 D and no pulling across the chest.
4.0,Stylish and great for protecting eyes after cataract surgery. Received many compliments. The optics are also excellent. I gave the glasses a 4 star rating because they were tight fitting and hurt after wearing a few hours.
4.0,Great gym shirt with comfortable material and not too tight
4.0,Very nice fit. Material not very breathable.
4.0,It fits really nice. I'm 6'2 And 245 pounds and this dress was really cute and really affordable. I recommend it 😄😄
4.0,"I purchased a necklace that was way too small for me, so instead of returning the necklace,I purchased the gold plated extendeder.<br />Very pleased with the length and quality of the Extender😊"
4.0,This was a gift from my niece.  She loved it!
4.0,Pretty but my husband had to fix one of the links that had disconnected.
4.0,[[VIDEOID:44e1143d8f0fc6f985400d578387f8d3]] very good and identical to the show! i love this necklace so much knowing it's from h2o. the only problem is that every time i wear it the opening part opens.
4.0,The pine color almost looks black. The 14 was too tight for me up top. I'm a 36G.
4.0,It was soft! Great color and very comfortable. Does run small
4.0,like the material
4.0,My 15 year old loves this dress. It is very light and fun. It fits as expected. We have only ever dry cleaned it.
4.0,"Beautiful necklace. It came in a nice box with a nice little bag for the necklace. Only reason for 4 stars and not 5 is it’s super short, like choker short. I might have read the  description incorrectly however it’s says it’s for a godmother and my sister asked if it was for my daughter! Had to purchase an extender for my sister to be able to wear it."
4.0,"I got these for my mom who has just a slight eyesight problem - nothing too major to where she shouldn't be on the road, but enough for her to not be confident. Obviously, she couldn't wear her sunglasses with her normal glasses, so I needed to find a cheaper option compared to what her eye care doctor could offer.<br /><br />Initial impressions when I first got these: these sunglasses come in a nice black case. It’s a sophisticated look, but isn’t too sturdy. It’s not going to withstand weight if you accidently sit on it, but I do see it taking a drop here and there. Moving on to the sunglasses, as soon as my mom put them on, she could tell that they'd do the job. They look sharp as well - nothing that screams for attention or looks peculiar. They’re nice and simple.<br /><br />Now, while the glasses and prescription are A-Okay, I can't say the same for the quality of the glasses. It's really flimsy and delicate: one drop is likely to break or shatter the whole thing. I was surprised when I first took them out of the case because the lens is pencil thin plastic. The nose piece is also concerningly thin metal, and I almost doubted that they’d hold up…. Well, they did, and at $11.99, I can't say that I'm surprised.<br /><br />Therefore, at this price point, keep in mind that you are sacrificing quality for a cheaper prescription. Be extra careful when handling these sunglasses, otherwise I suggest purchasing some prescription lenses for something of more quality."
4.0,"Not real thick, light compression"
4.0,Thought they were squat proof until my boyfriend told me I shouldn’t wear them on leg day anymore lol
4.0,"Bought this for a Christmas party for work. I just received it and it's pretty and is as pictured but I'm not 100% in love just yet. I bought an 8 (I'm about 140 pounds/ 36B) but It's a little loose in the bust and a tad tight in my stomach area. Nothing to the point where I can't breath but where I notice my hips/stomach a bit more than I'd like. I can get by with a padded bra; however, if you wanted to go with out a bra you would be fine. I'm going to hang on to it for a bit but keep searching.<br /><br />I'm include a quick picture of it right out of the bag, so it's wrinkly. Wanted to give others an Idea of the dress."
4.0,"As advertised, would have been great if it was a few inches longer though. Quality seems fine for the price."
4.0,Fits Beautifully.. Heavy material.. Very impressed with the entire suit
4.0,It arrived on time; it fits and it appears as advertised.
4.0,"great value, glasses could have been a little wider. Both worked out fine on the range."
4.0,"Ordered to replace my scratched up RB lenses. Easy to install, just wish the lenses were darker!! Good quality ."
4.0,This cardigan is over sized and very cute. I purchased the grey and it is very pretty. I always get compliment on it. I am not a big fan of the button but I could always remove them if I wanted to.
4.0,"Sweater was right size in the back but way too short on the arms. Nothing like the picture. I’m 5’10 and long arms, but this was extremely short for an XL. Nice overall and I’ll keep it. Maybe would reco to go up a size so it’s bigger if that’s the look you want."
4.0,Fits great once I get them over my hips. Wish the waist band had a bit more stretch.
4.0,"I use these as house shoes. They fit my 11"" foot well."
4.0,I bought these scrubs in 2016 and consistently wore them until a few weeks ago. The one thighs kinda just wore away from constant wear so i had to get rid of them so no one got a free show. They are comfortable. I prefer scrubs with a drawstring so that I can control how tight they are. I am 5'1 and I did have to have these hemmed which made me lose the slit at the ankle. But they did me good for 6 years.
4.0,Not suitable for large calves. I had to return them.
4.0,Great water or summer shoe.
4.0,"I love the color of it, and I love how soft it feels,I can't wait to style it, however, it's a lot thinner then I had thought,and sometimes ,if your hair isn't down well enough, you can see the cap ( then again I'm used to super thick wigs) However, it was nice out the bag, and combed easily, i'm 5'6&#34; and it comes just below my butt, so That makes up for it :) I recommend buying though :D, just remember that you might need to cut the bangs since it's really long ( or my face is just small)"
4.0,"Pretty soft which feels good.  Waist fits well but does require a belt as they don't have a flex waist.  They look super sharp with a polo, short sleeved button up, or a t-shirt."
4.0,"This came and was a surprise! It is very well made and allows no bothersome sun-rays in the eyes to get you ;) .I really like the product and expect that it will be on our deck for a few years to come.  I can't really attest to how long it lasts, but I can say that so far, so good."
4.0,"Arrived SUPER fast. Exactly what I was looking for. Only drawback is it isn't lined, but for the price, that's OK."
4.0,The dress top portion was not the same as the picture. Although this was not the same dress this was cute. However I sent it back because it was much too big in the front. I’m 5’5 118 lbs and got the small.
4.0,Pinkish tint to the color
4.0,"It is a neat looking set, but was cheaply made and several pieces broke in the first day."
4.0,"I bought a 3x.  It will fit my daughter who wears a large.  She will enjoy it.  Cheap material, so you get what you pay for.  NOT for my wedding dress, but oh well.  I will learn to shop local."
4.0,Good quality! Super cute and perfect for themed party. Perfect match with decorations!
4.0,"Overall it's ok, if you are not firm and have areas that jiggle you might want to buy a size up, other than that it looks ok on me."
4.0,Liked it while it lasted
4.0,"Dress is a soft slinky material, not knit like I hoped, but still great. Fits a little big, but not baggy. Had pockets, adorable print and can't beat the price!"
4.0,"nice beads, easy to adjust size"
4.0,"The color is a greenish/gray color, perfect for the fall season. I am a size 7.5, but ordered a 7. The boots fitted very well. Recommend if anyone is between sizes, to size down instead of up. The shoe can fit ppl with big and/or small calves."
4.0,"Definitely, would recommend. I wore these to my friend's wedding and they kept me from sinking during the ceremony. I would note however that after 3 hours in heels on the grass they start to bend. So I wouldn't wear them for long periods of time. Other than that they worked great!"
4.0,"Heavy material, beautiful., but tight under the arms. Next size up probably would be too loose. Kept it though, as it is a lovely dress."
4.0,"Good condition and quality. Overall, in satisfied with my purchase."
4.0,"I really likes the dress,but it was just a tad to tight.If it was made in the next size up ,it would of been great. Sorry I had to return."
4.0,"It's a cute fun &#34;swimsuit&#34; if you can call it that- it's poorly decorative pool side/beachwear.  it's  made out of decent material, tho. I don't think it's made to last for a very long time. It's a regular swimsuit, cut out, and tied to get this pattern. cuts are loose so edges it'll eventually frail."
4.0,My husband loves the movie.  He started laughing so hard when he opened the gift. The material is soft and the color is bright.
4.0,The fabric and string attachments were made pretty cheaply however this was a great gift idea and my wife loved them
4.0,I love the material and the style! It was a little too short for me though but perfect for hot weather!
4.0,A little late but it came from China. Is beautifull i love it
4.0,"I have been looking for something just like this for a long time.  I have a very busy household; my teenagers constantly have girlfriends/boyfriends over and I too often am trying to be comfortable, yet look somewhat presentable when unexpected guests arrive/are sleeping over.  This is exactly what I've been looking for, except for the fact that it runs very small.  I wear a size 14/16, so sometimes I need a Large and sometimes I need an Extra Large.  Since I read that it runs small, I ordered the Extra Large.  It doesn't even close  :(  My daughter, however, who wears a size Medium is happily getting lots of use out of this, coming back and forth to her room from the shower, etc.  The below pictures show how it fits me and how it fits her.  Obviously, I can't use it, because it doesn't close, but besides that there is not a thing we don't like about it.  It looks and feels great!  Very pretty and I love the color too.<br /><br />I received this product for a discounted rate, in exchange for my honest, unbiased review.  I would recommend to anyone who is smaller that a 14/16, just make sure you order 2 sizes bigger than what you need."
4.0,Soft stretchy but very sheer. Not as long as other similar style dresses. I loved it but make sure to wear the appropriate undergarments.
4.0,"Some of them fit differently. Like the material was more stretchy for the grey one and a little less for the other colors, but good quality. I like them."
4.0,"they are nice.i agree with the other reviewer that they are a bit thinner than expected. if you dont pull them up as high (thigh) then they become a tad more solid, but im very petite so if they are almost see through somewhat on my legs then on a fuller figured woman they would be almost sheer. but again they are still very cute. nice individual wrapping. soft, not itchy. and good for the price. shipping was good too. :)"
4.0,Cute and cotton
4.0,Dress is nice but was not the color I needed. The picture provided makes the color look more red. It's more on the darker side or red/pink. Loved the fabric and the style. Sad it didn't work out. Would love this is a bright red.
4.0,"I love this pair of pants, and the only reason I can't give it 5 stars is because the fabric is a bit itchy on bare skin and heavier weight than linen or silk. It's great to wear in weather under 85 degrees F, but are otherwise a little too much. If you have sensitive skin, you might want to wear leggings or  something underneath."
4.0,"not bad nice looking good value, thick material seems durable."
4.0,"I love this.  It is lightweight but still gets the job done.  Living in Florida, I needed something that isn't too hot but still helps me when it rains.  This is perfect."
4.0,"there nice, but looks kind of cheap but I guess thats what you expect when you spend a certain amount of money for an item that is not steeinless earrings."
4.0,"Lovely product, great buy.<br />Unfortunately, too lol very!  My keys were taken off my desk within a day!<br />Somebody is sporting a beautiful leather keychain!"
4.0,"Great masks, but way too jig for the kids. Fit their mommy better"
4.0,A very cozy flannel and pretty color scheme.  I'm sorry I didn't realize that it didn't button  all the way down requiring pulling overhead.
4.0,"I absolutely love how comfortable these tight fitting undershorts are. Super soft and slinky material with lots of stretch and give. (Sorry for the lack of action shots and wearing them, but being a plus sized mama, I am not about to show all the jiggle and wiggle parts highlighted by spandex!) They are perfect to wear under a skirty or long dress if you worry about your thighs rubbing together or sweating. But I have not gotten them for that purpose nor worn them under anything other than baggy shirts. They are definitely a lot thinner than I thought they would be, and if you are hoping for some ""hold it all in"" you aren't going to get that here. Not slimming or smoothing at all due to the stretch. But they are so comfy for around the house work and lounging! They were a little larger than I expected, too, but not so much that they don't work for me. I probably should have ordered a size smaller. So I would suggest you order a size smaller than you normally wear to be sure it fits properly. But all of that said, I would definitely have no problem buying this again or recommending it to others to try out."
4.0,"very cute nice quality, right size for me."
4.0,Bought it for a crab feed.  Everyone loved it.  Got offers to buy it off me.  Fit well and wore it for about 5 hours
4.0,"Simple design, easy to close Zipper and buttons. A little short for what I normally like, but still a decent pair of shorts."
4.0,"Size Large - I'm 5'6 and 130 lbs. Depending on how you like to wear your tee shirts is how you would order. I don't like my clothes tight, so I ordered up and got the fit I like - not too baggy but not skin tight. The design is adorable but it is like one of those iron on rubbery things. The thing to think about this shirt is that it is a $17 dollar applique t-shirt for the holiday! I love my gobble! 4 Stars! Hope you find this review and pictures helpful! Material is okay - your typical t-shirt material - cotton - hard until you wash it! I recommend washing inside out and drip drying!"
4.0,The jacket is nice but for me it's a bit too big but that's because i'm skinny lol. The jacket itself is a great budget option for a casual business thing.
4.0,I bought this last minute before going to Mexico. It fit fine and looked way more expensive than it was. I felt very comfortable wearing this around the resort and in the restaurants for lunch over my swimsuit
4.0,"I love this dress.  Can wear it in the summer because its not too hot, in the winter with a coat.  And I throw in the washer and drier with no problem."
4.0,"Pretty color, but doesn’t look cute on me."
4.0,Feels like leather just smaller than I had wanted.
4.0,Shorter than I thought but shows jewelry well
4.0,"only took a week to get here!  I'm 5'4 and 115 lbs, I ordered a medium and shouldve bought a small. it fits a big baggy and covers my stomach, it reaches my hips so its not really a crop top. but  it still looks cute and its soft and comfy, I'm glad I ordered !"
4.0,"So I read the reviews and got a smaller size.  I think my babe is just too young for the style.  She is 18 months and I got size small, or size for 12 months and under.  They would be great for an older toddler that knows how to use the thumb."
4.0,"Well...it FINALLY CAME!! And it is the cutest lil thing ever...just as it's described. I brought a Lg. I'm 5'4 173lbs. The arms are a lil tight but that's ok, I'll just where it like a tub top. Lost 1 star for late/lost package but Amazon took care of that!!"
4.0,It’s super cute and unique but after a period of time it will leave a greenish tint on your finger.
4.0,"Update: I am knocking this rating down for a couple of reasons. The first is that the reliability has if anything gotten worse; also, the buckle on the strap has gotten discolored, presumably by contact with sweat.<br /><br />This is a nice-looking automatic movement skeleton steampunk watch with OK timekeeping at a bargain of a price.<br /><br />(What this means) An automatic movement watch is self-winding. A skeleton watch is one where the parts are visible and you can see through the watch. One of the downsides of an automatic watch is that it may run down at irregular intervals depending on how much you move around. One of the upside of a skeleton watch is that you can see when it's winding down.<br /><br />This means you shouldn't run out of motion by surprise! Look at the zoomed-in picture attached to this review. See the red circle? Inside that circle is the spring that stores the energy that runs the watch. If it's running low, you can wind it up with the knob. Or think of it as the steampunk version of FitBit, Pokemon Go, et cetera and take that as a cue to go for a walk. UPDATE: That said, mine is sometimes running out overnight even after being heavily charged during a very active afternoon. I read another review that suggested this watch has a long endurance from a full charge; YMMV.<br /><br />The steampunk genre is inspired by retro science fiction. Think Victorian era science fiction. The steampunk aesthetic tends to involve lots of leather, brass, and gears. Sometimes decorative gears. In this case, the gears are functional.<br /><br />(Mechanics) The insides of the watch are build by Shenhua, as you will see if you look closely at the pictures. You'll notice that some of the other watches in this price range also have Shenhua movements, so if you want to get a good idea of the level of reliability of the movement, read reviews of other watches that use a Shenhua automatic movement. Conversely, the reviews on this watch might give you an idea of the reliability of watches that share the movement.<br /><br />The timekeeping is not very precise by watch standards. Mine is currently running a minute and a half fast. This would be unacceptable in an actual luxury watch, but in a $22 watch with an automatic movement (the bargain basement) it's not so shabby and does make it a practical timepiece, provided you check it against a clock as often as you would normally wind a mechanical watch.<br /><br />(Aesthetics) I am not entirely sure the strap is actually leather. If it is, it's got a thick coat of waterproof finish on it. However, the watch is nice-looking and is indeed a great match for the steampunk aesthetic. The back (which isn't visible in the pictures, or when wearing it) is a practical combination of stainless steel and glass, and will therefore not leave a green spot on your wrist.<br /><br />Caveats:<br /><br />1. This is a review based on a watch I started wearing at the end of July 2016. I will update this review if new information comes to light, it breaks, et cetera. UPDATE: I updated this in the later half of August.<br />2. I'm not saying it's great, but for a watch I bought for $22 with the features it has, I'll rate it four stars.<br />3. I have not stress-tested it beyond its product description. (E.g., I haven't taken it swimming / diving - just running in the rain and mud for a few hours here and there.)"
4.0,"These leggings are great, however they must have not been sewn right because there was a big hole in seam of the butt area.  Took them to my cleaners to see them up but overall a good product."
4.0,Somewhat small but not too much.  Like the flow and color.
4.0,A very very very reasonable price and a fun bracelet as well as meaningful.
4.0,Nephew loves it!
4.0,"I think it was very nice quality, It just runs small. It also has no give. I will try and purchase again."
4.0,Very please - classy and professional. Would definitely purchase it again.
4.0,Underwire is sooo stiff and uncomfortable
4.0,Just a bit big for a medium. But the fabric is fantastic and so is the green color. It seemed a bit darker in person. But not much different.
4.0,"Pay attention to the measurements. I thought I could squeeze into the one I purchased, all the measurements were right except the bust, so ... I have to use safety pins to keep my chest from showing. Just go with your measurements and it will be perfect."
4.0,it is very good i love it but i do not like the part when you use a chain
4.0,"Very cute belt, comes with a hole punch too. Love the design. Just don’t expect it to be your only belt that is needed as an actual belt. I think it will crease easy if you use it every day."
4.0,"I liked this over all, but the skirt was a bit shorter than I expected it to be. I ordered a large, wish I would have ordered an XL. The top was also a large for my chest size. I plan on wearing it to pride so it’s okay for a special occasion but I wouldn’t wear it anywhere else."
4.0,"I love satin pajamas. It feels so soft and cooling for the summer nights. In the product image it looks more pink than it does in person...it's more beige/tan as the product color describes. I ordered my larger size, XL. The shorts fit perfectly but the top's buttons start to gap at my chest. So i have not wore the set together...just the shorts. Overall it is very cute though and would definitely recommend if you have a smaller chest! I'm a 40DDD bra for reference (normally wear L/XL in tops)."
4.0,"The ring is very nice, but it is not in a bold size as the headline states. Fortunately, I have a small hand, so it still looks good on me. Could be a perfect pinky ring for a man with large hands. Overall, I am happy with the purchase."
4.0,Somewhat too long around the waist but I made it work. I love this dress!
4.0,This hat is stylish and warm. I love it.
4.0,"Love! These are a beautiful ankle boot! I wear a 9 in woman's, and these are about a 1/2 size to big. With that said, they are so comfortable to wear!! I think that little bit if extra space adds to the comfort level for me."
4.0,Makes biking alot more comfy! They fit great!!!
4.0,"This set of plugs is great value for the price, but it's worth noting that the flares are not all the same size on the plugs. For example, I tried putting the opalite plugs into my ears and they wouldn't fit. When I tried the hematite (?) plugs, they fit easily, and when I compared them side by side, the opalite plugs clearly had bigger flares. It's not a problem for me, but just keep this in mind if you buy them."
4.0,Jeff&Amy trapper hat. This hat is comfortable and is exactly what we needed for my daughters Halloween costume. It has fake fur which does shed around the front of the hat and along the ears. It has green canvas material for the top and back.  There is a faux brown leather chin strap which a buckle. The hat is warm and fits well. Great hat for multi uses.
4.0,Pretty good purse my only complaint is pocket in back was not deep like waste of space
4.0,"Does exactly what I need, holds my pants up."
4.0,Would have given 5 stars but the design on the top was done very lightly to wheres almost not visible in some spots. Other wise beautiful keepsake for baby growing up. I have another one I bought prior this one I use for my 7 year old and its holding up well.
4.0,"I have received a lot of compliments with these. However, the black pieces above did eventually pop out. I think they look just as good, anyway."
4.0,"Love them for fishing and driving,  my pair fit my head perfect. .I have a fat head though lol..the case is awesome. .but the neck string broke...that is the only thing bad I found."
4.0,"Looks a little cheap, but what do you expect for the price.  Definitely will fit a woman as a short necklace.  Pearls are decent size."
4.0,"After reading the multitude of reviews that advised to order 1 or 2 larger sizes, I did just that, ordering 1 size larger.  Even with that, it just fits.  I believe the reason for the universal size discrepancy is that this jacket is really a women's jacket and the sizes listed are women's sizes.  I base this on the fact that the zipper pull tab is on the left side, not the right side as is typical for men's wear.  But regardless, I like the jacket."
4.0,I bought this as a Christmas present.. When i first received it i was unsure. It was the perfect gift. She loved it !
4.0,"Great watch for the money. It arrived in a nice box with a small ribbon glued onto it. Nice touch. Also included was a card to fill out in case it was a gift. Again nice touch.<br />I must have small wrists because I could use another hole tighter. I would have given it 5 stars, but the watch was already running."
4.0,I've got a big head and it was a little loose on me. Quick fix by tying a bandana around the mid section.
4.0,"fits well, doesn't bother me while I'm cooking or doing the dishes."
4.0,Cute but a little large … I have a loose thread already
4.0,Like the retention ring. lost a couple previous ones in the car wash during the winter.
4.0,I bought this for my daughter's orchestra concert. She loved it. It fit perfectly. My only issue is that the zipper was on the side right under the arm and it didn't go all the way to the top so there was really no purpose for the zipper. Otherwise it was lightweight and very pretty. As pictured and don't forget to buy a petticoat for it too.
4.0,Good but had to add a strap to stay on my sons head.
4.0,"Meh it will do. I’m 5’4, 160lbs, 34DD, and the medium fits somewhat looser than I’d like it to in the waist, shoulders and arms. However, despite being short, the length is shorter than I’d like it to be (ankle length). I would go down another size if I weren’t worried about the length getting even shorter. Other than that it’s a decent dress. Nice material and colors."
4.0,Light weight and looks like it in the game !
4.0,Loved these tapers but the only complaint I have is that going from sizes 8 to 6 there was a huge difference. My husband tried them as well as we are the same size (8) and when we tried going to 6’s it was just really hard. Also the 6 hearts are shaped differently so they were difficult to put in. But other than that it is a nice kit.
4.0,It's a great gift.
4.0,My son loved these masks
4.0,Wonderful!<br />My son like it a lot in everything.<br />Very good condition and fast delivery.<br />I will recommend all friends to buy this product.
4.0,"It's good quality! The beads are heavy and stable, and the elastic allows multiple wrist sizes to work. But, they're a little bigger than expected. The black one is bigger than the white, thinking the guy will get it. But if you wanted to wear the black, it's rather easy to fix if you have the right string. Overall great! ❤"
4.0,"Stunning, but run small....sadly"
4.0,"But used to it w Amazon.  Meandeor.<br /> Great quality tho! I'm 5'5 & 170 lbs, got a XXL & it fits a lil too big.  Not sending it back for that tho, it could shrink perfectly.  Sending it back as I didnt realize how much a white sweater duster looks like a medical lab coat.  Really corny.  Maybe trade dor black!"
4.0,Very nice bag!<br />Love the pockets on the inside and the length of the bag is perfect!<br />I'm able to fit my kindle and iPad in the bag along with some other things. It's the perfect size
4.0,"Super cute, a bit thinner than I thought it would be, but it's ok for what I need."
4.0,"See through, you may want to under shirt for this. I just put another black tank top under it."
4.0,Selected this item as an add on for Mother's Day.  Item looks just as it appears worked when right away and my wife got lots of compliments from coworkers!
4.0,Great for those of us with rounder/fuller faces/cheeks who want to wear the Aviator style of sunglasses.
4.0,"Super comfy, overall mostly flattering, and a great color wash to go with lots of things. Doesn't seem to hold up the best, as I've had them for about six months and anywhere that gets more wear and tear is thinning out, and it doesn't wear in a way that looks like cute worn jeans."
4.0,Didn’t hold its color . Tarnished
4.0,"Love the idea and design of this shirt but it hangs more straight than A-line so if you have hips, the pockets are a bit of a challenge because they stick out. Design would have been better if pockets would have been sewn onto the front as flat pockets instead of being built into the side seams that causes the bulk inside material for the pockets to bulge out. Or, make the shirt a little more A line for those of us that actually have shapes. :)"
4.0,Cute top. Fit will and good quality but I returned because I was looking for something longer.
4.0,"It Cute and OK material. Waist has no elastic so it's not so snug. The top is opposite wear from the skirt, which is weird. Tiny top."
4.0,"Very nice necklace, however the back of the necklace could be a bit better. It is flat and plain and could use some better rounding or details to make it look much higher quality."
4.0,"Was very surprised when I opened the shipping bag.  The quality of the fabric and make was done very well.  Very soft.  The reason I only gave it four stars was because the neckline was a little wider than expected.  Otherwise, it is a great find and the price was perfect."
4.0,Good color and fit. I'm happy that it is washable so it could be put in the dryer to remove wrinkles from shipping.  Color was as shown and true to size.
4.0,"I like these leggings, they are a bit thin though.  But, I do love the feel of them - they really do feel like &#34;peach skin.&#34;"
4.0,Goog fabric. Just don't like the plastic adjustment system. it would be better a fabric strap.
4.0,Can’t wait to wear these in the month of December. We have to wear masks so why not switch them up and have fun. Cute and inexpensive. Shipping was way earlier than expected.
4.0,"Very comfy like wearing yoga pants. I usually wear medium and they do fit, but can be a little high in the waist. I ordered another set in small, and they seemed to fit more true to size. I normally wear a size 8 pants. They never bunch up or cut in around the legs like some underwear does around the elastic.  I will definitely order these again"
4.0,Oder this to be my Spring purse. I love it.
4.0,Excellent light weight dress for warm days. The fit was great. I have thicker arms and it wasn’t tight around the arms. I’m 5’3” and is hits me right below the knee. I was thinking it would be longer but it is still very flattering. The material is very soft and nice quality.
4.0,"If it would have fit, I would have kept it..."
4.0,"Decent underwear, had an issue with a couple of the pairs in the package but customer service was outstanding and took care of my problem asap. Great seller and good product"
4.0,Works well. Used this for a 7hr flight to the UK. The jersey fabric is soft and the hoodie is a nice touch.<br />My only complaint is that the hoodie is smaller than it looks.
4.0,This is my second purchase of the 6-pairs.  They don't bind at the toes.  I like the lace edging.  They stay on your feet when you are walking.  I like the wash bag.  I recommend.  I think they are great!
4.0,"Rating 4 stars since the price is currently unavailable and I dont see myself paying a while lot for socks. If affordable these would be 5 stars for sure, they are very comfortable and thick but not enough that it would affect the way your shoes fit. Perfect for hard floors, long walks and a good run. Highly recommended"
4.0,Twill pattern looks nice and is a subtle touch to the design of this band. Fits the Gear S2 perfectly
4.0,Great stocking stuffer.  Some of the lights didn't work out of the box though.
4.0,Great quality! Light weight!
4.0,Gonna be great to scare the kids
4.0,I love the snake print dress! But the tie dyed dress is a different fabric and not comfy
4.0,So far I like these glasses. They do not have a color filter on the lens (my other ones are yellowish) so it's nice to see the screen for what it is. They are light and simple so you don't really feel like you're wearing glasses all day. It's hard to say whether or not they are actually blocking the blue light so I guess I'll have to wait a while to review eye strain level.
4.0,"Good dress for the cost- fits as expected but if you want something more fitted, order a size down. Great patterning- it’s different but classy."
4.0,"A bit loose. Other Solar Shield polarized sunglasses that go over regular glasses are not loose, and can be worn comfortably both ways. These are loose without regular glasses underneath."
4.0,"So far these have worked well. Like others have said, they're thicker than normal earrings (in order to fit around them...) but after a few days the soreness will wear off and your ears will be used to them. They did split when I tried to put the back on but I just trimmed the post down to the length my ear needed and then I can slide the back on to where I need it while still not touching the cheap metal of trendy earrings I can finally wear! Looking forward to enjoying these."
4.0,"Nice quality socks.  Needed ones with the grippers on the bottom and these work well. Wash well too.  However, they do run small."
4.0,"I'm very happy with this purchase. I bought it as a replacement for a similar Tumi crossbody and I actually like this bag more than that one. This is perfect for any busy mom who needs to keep her hands-free for caring for little ones and their various needs! Durable, classic, several separate compartments for keeping organized, smooth zippers, and enough space for all essentials ---wallet, keys, phone, wipes, snacks, etc. Wipes clean easily as well. Would recommend this."
4.0,Good price for a quick pair of Tac pants when this color was needed. A bit more snug (which I liked) than your 5.11's.
4.0,"I only wear masks at work and other places where they are required, and I'm not convinced that they're as effective as claimed.  Anyway, that said, while I'm not sure they're going to give you protection against the virus, they are comfortable and easy to breathe through."
4.0,"Not bad. These do in fact make a noticeable difference in the creasing on my forums. However it kind of still creases a small amount, just farther up the shoe in a less conspicuous area. Still have to watch how you step but not anywhere near as much, I wish they came up a little higher on the foot. They’re comfortable. Inserted into my shoe before wearing and the guards basically aren’t noticeable to me, could barely feel them. They’re flexible for comfort. Haven’t worn longer than a few hours at a time, so they are comfy for atleast that long. I have wide feet and they’re ok. All around good quality. Nice simple handy product. Good price for a 4 pack, I like them, hope to keep my shoes looking good. Such a great find!  Thank you!"
4.0,"I ordered these before a trip up north as I didn't want to spend much on several pairs of wool socks. While they did fit tightly and didn't stay pulled up all day, they kept my feet warm for the most part."
4.0,They stay in place but can start to hurt the back of the ankles after a full days use
4.0,I gave them to my grand daughter
4.0,"I do love the design + length, material is very thin, and very see through. That would be my only complaint, but I’d also rather everyone see the outline of my legs then EVER wear a slip. They’re designed by Satan and you can’t convince me other-wise."
4.0,"I ordered an XL, I'm 5""1, 138 Lb for reference. The bottom fits perfectly, not too tight, highwaisted, and nice tummy control. The top bra protion fits well, has great coverage, and some support (comes with removable pads, can be tied at the bust, and has adjustable straps). Although, the extra banned at the bottom was a bit loose on me and not as flattering in person. I could have gone a size down, but it was a quick fix with a few minor alterations."
4.0,"I have several of these loungers from another distributer, and the only thing that I have to say against it is that it is not as heavy as my older ones.  But still a great find.  I will be ordering more.  Size is maybe a little larger than expected."
4.0,Perfect for kids masks.
4.0,"Sports bras have a reputation for being almost impossible to get on alone, and this one is no exception. But once you get someone to help you hook it after you get it on, it's great. I wear a 36D, and this bra is very comfortable. Although it didn't completely eliminate bounce, it was snug enough so that the bouncing wasn't that bad. Some racer-back bras' straps have a tendency to ride up on my neck and become uncomfortable, but this one's straps stayed in place all day. I used the middle set of hooks, and found the bottom elastic edge comfortable enough to wear all day. Overall, it's well-constructed, and comfortable, although lacking in design (can't hook it by myself). I'd recommend it."
4.0,Fun for around the house
4.0,"Great retro look I used mostly daily and still working, a perfect dark for sunny days, a little weak frame specially in the hinges so used it gently but I do like it."
4.0,Wat too cute
4.0,"I think this wallet is beautiful and would be perfect if the card slots weren't so tight. I was hoping they would loosen a little with time, but with the position of the button on the interior of the wallet, I don't think there is a way for them to loosen enough to realistically use all of the card slots. That said, it's really pretty so I'm keeping it despite the inconvenience."
4.0,"I was pleasantly surprised by this swimsuit. I purchased it when I saw how cute and cheap it was. I was unsure of the sizing and if I would like it since it is a bikini, but I love It! I ordered the Large because I have a very small chest and hoped my wide hips would fit in the bottoms. They actually both for perfectly, which surprised me because I and very pear shaped. They is a great suit for the price, but I marked off a star because when the suit arrived there were already strings dangling from the bottoms. I will need to fix that, but overall I love it."
4.0,"I love these masks.  Printed image is clear, the size is perfect.  I only wish that the back was black and not white.  If they came out with options for black backs, I'd purchase again."
4.0,"They're beautiful, but the clasp is a little difficult for me to fasten it by myself."
4.0,"The dress by itself looks a little bit like a moomoo or even pjs. Add a belt and it's perfect! Not as long as expected, I'm 5'3"" and it sits well above where a typical maxi dress would sit. But it still looks cute, none the less. Comfortable, lightweight and it has pockets!!"
4.0,"Super comfy.  I hope the elastic stretches a big more because its snug, but i think that will come in time.  They are thin but not see thru thin. Very soft.  Ill be purchasing another pair"
4.0,They are very comfortable but they run big. I bought an XL and they are way to big should have bought large instead.
4.0,"Love these! I cant give five stars for them cause they are not the one and only pair I wear(I lost those) they are great for not wanting to have people staring in your face. The cool color is looks chic  for most attire but its better to  have a mother load of variety of sunglasses these are the right price stylish enough to keep in the mix. The clear frame is not heavy, I like them because they are different enough.Who will look the best??/ I can imagine they would not look good on someone with a low hair line, heart shape or really round face. Oval all the way baby..."
4.0,Product received as advertised
4.0,"This wrist band was purchased as a replacement for the wrist band on the Casio AE-1300WH watch.  The band fit perfectly in the 18mm opening, but the material of band was a bit stiff.  The cost of this band makes it a great alternative to the Casio brand wrist band."
4.0,"SO FAR, it's a nice piece, certainly better than paying $45 from other comany's"
4.0,"These are great for playing pickleball. They're very lightweight, but not transparent. The length is perfect--just below the knee. I am 5'8""; 130 lbs. Size medium fit nicely. True, the built-in panty gives you a panty line, but I wear a long tank top with the shorts, so it's not problem. (It would be easy to cut the lining out.) I will definitely buy these again in other colors.<br /><br />Update: I bought a navy pair, and there was a hole in one of the side seams where the stitching missed. I was going to exchange them, but they are out of navy in size M, so I decided to repair them on my sewing machine. Luckily, the repair worked!"
4.0,Nice big face. Looks like a much more expensive timepiece. Would have given it 5 stars but the band is showing signs of wear rather quickly. I just purchased this thing. All in all it's pretty cool though.
4.0,"This dress is super cute on! I love the material, it's supportive, but also allows you to move freely. The only flaw I have, is the neck part comes up a little bit high, but not a big deal"
4.0,The kit is very sturdy and looks good. The only complaint is it is too sturdy and isn't flexible for odd shaped items.
4.0,Very comfortable and fit perfectly. Size M for 5' 6&#34; 135 lbs.
4.0,5'8&#34; and 172lbs. Purchased a medium due to previous reviews. Legs have a little slack but easy to cover in boots. Great design but quite snug in the &#34;lower regions&#34; not leaving much to the imagination.
4.0,"Comfy. Not as thick as I expected. Pocket is a  little weird (starts right under my boobs and is kinda big). Nice color, soft material. I ordered one size up from my normal and it fit exactly how I wanted (loose, but not huge)."
4.0,"Used as my 4 year old’s soccer socks. It fit perfectly before washing but it did shrink after wash. It still fits him with no shin guards under. If you plan to put a shin guard under it I suggest to size up, fit will be perfect after washinh."
4.0,This suits rocks!!! I can definitely works as explained. You body temperature is definitely held in. They run a little small so I advise order 1 size bigger.
4.0,I liked the color and the fit.
4.0,"I love these socksfit perfectly, and very comfortable and will probably buy again."
4.0,"I like it.  It is made of fairly cheap materials, but it was cheap to purchase.  It fits the watch perfectly and I use it in rotation with the other bands I have.  A big plus is that it fits (barely) around my nearly 9&#34; wrist."
4.0,They fit really well but the lenses tend to distort some colors into a rainbow effect
4.0,"I only say somewhat small for the top of the dress. The top is a little fitted, the bottom is perfect. I only tried it on when I bought it. When I wear it I will see if it has any give up top. I am a 42b up top."
4.0,i got these lights for my niece because she loves playing with lights.  she has yet to put them down lol
4.0,Size was too small for a men’s 10-1/2 foot.
4.0,"I saw these and thought they looked pretty good as far as over the glasses sunglasses. They are actually pretty nice. They fit well and there aren't really any blind spots when wearing them. The only thing I don't like about over the glasses sunglasses is how large they are. Look at regular sunglasses - they don't completely cover the side of your eye. Why do these need to? Sunglasses cover your eye but most of the time don't go any farther toward your face. The over the glasses sunglasses act more like goggles than sunglasses. That's my only beef and it's not with this pair in particular, but the actual whole category of over the glasses sunglasses."
4.0,"Thick material, but pants too long. I'm 5'1. Will get altered and post photo soon"
4.0,"Quality is good - nice and light.  A little wide, however.  The height is good, but the width is a little much."
4.0,Little small for a 2X
4.0,"Lovely, it looks far more expensive than it is. I love the way it shines."
4.0,It’s a great lightweight warm vest
4.0,I have a big head. Usually only Fatheadz sunglasses fit. These glasses aren't as wide as I'd like; they still squeeze a little.
4.0,"Came in a reasonable amount of time.  It is a smaller Dooney, but perfect for my size."
4.0,I’ve used This product for years and love them.
4.0,Fun and lightweight !!
4.0,"I got this for the boyfriend. He is an XL in some brands and some brands he is a 2XL. However, we compared this to one of his old shirts, which was a L, and it was a little smaller than his Large shirts. It is a well made shirt. It looks nice and is made of good fabric. The stitching is well done and it looks like if it was made in American sizes, that maybe it would look great on. But it fits more like a large, almost on the small side of the large? Not what we are accustomed to here. It was shipped from China so maybe the sizing is different? Overall it is a great shirt, but if you are a genuine XL, don't bother, it won't fit. I received this at a discount for an honest and unbiased review."
4.0,vibrant
4.0,gusta
4.0,"My daughter wore this all winter and loved it. Very stylish. We did need to buy two sets because the first one is was too big. If you're on the fence, buy the smaller size. We kept the larger one to wear when she gets a little older, maybe next year."
4.0,"I was very happy with the timing of the shipping from this company. My girls and I had to minister through dance during a church service. They leos fit as expected with a little growing room. At first I wasn't too sure about the material because it was not like what I have seen in some stores, but I was very pleased with the thickness and the structure.  Overall I would order the same brand in other colors."
4.0,I liked the product just fine. They were a gift for a baby shower. The box was a little mangled hence the 4 stars..
4.0,Good sturdy bag. My only issue is that the lining is very thin and over time I would say is prone to tearing over time. One would think that such a sturdy bag would have a similarly sturdy lining.
4.0,"So far so good, attractive and classy...unusual watch not found most places at a very nice price."
4.0,"I love the print, and the fabric is soft. Not as much movement to the fabric as rayon, but still like it."
4.0,"I love them, get tons of compliments. Just be aware that the gold starts to rub off to a silver after a few months, especially on the parts by the nose. Once this happens, it'll leave dark smudge marks on the bridge of your nose."
4.0,The quality and fit are good for the price.
4.0,Cute for a thematic gift!
4.0,"This is a beautifully crafted watch . However, I could not give it 5 stars because the wristband length very long and I could not wear it to fit like  a watch, but more like a bracelet (i.e. loose vs fitting). Though the watch came with a tool to take out as many metal links as needed to form fit to wrist, it was too difficult for me to do. I took it to a jeweler and he said some of the links were not aligned.  I ended up changing the band to a leather one, provided by the jeweler. But he, too, confirmed that the watch was of good quality."
4.0,My mom was so in ahh when she received it as a surprise for her birthday.
4.0,"I read reviews before buying. The medium is definitely slim fitting, but I am a curvy gal. There is no room for hiding anything. But the large was supposedly way way larger so I didn’t go with it. I will wear these - the top is slightly more forgiving than the shorts. The shorts are high waisted on me, but I am 5’1 so that doesn’t bother me. I probably wouldn’t order these again, but I think they are ok enough not to send back. The colors are exactly what I wanted in person. And I like that the shirt is cut boxy. They are not super thin and not thick, should keep my temperature just fine."
4.0,"Nice dress, unfortunately the pleats fall in very unflattering positions in the front and rear"
4.0,I was expecting a better quality for the string. Wish the cloor was more opaque.  Craftsmanship is pretty good. Well made. Cute for a gift. Worth the money.
4.0,"Easy to read watch, but I don't like the band. Even though it is easy to adjust to make smaller, the clip tends to open and the watch falls off"
4.0,Perfect for summer.  Might buy the white one next.
4.0,Exactly what I needed. They are good when conducting exercisies or sports that involve running or biking. They are not good when doing sit-ups or a lot of bending motions. The small ring pops off fairly easy.
4.0,"Very comfortable dress. Love that it has pockets. I’m 5’2” and the length was perfect for sandals. I ordered a large, as I am quite chesty and it was a bit loose in the armpit area but nothing noticeable. I have yet to wash and dry."
4.0,"The gem is a bit dull, but the whole piece is in a perfect shape, fits everyday purpose."
4.0,Great customer service. Products was a little less quality than what we expected. They took care of us very quickly and remedied our situation.
4.0,not as good as shown but it is nice!!
4.0,I received many compliments on this mask. It was fun to have it activate when I spoke. The velcro placement worked well with my pink wig. Fun times with this mask!
4.0,Not the same but still cute
4.0,Like the material & style. Truly cropped but not too revealing. Got a good modern retro feel in an updated fashion.
4.0,"I just tried on the costume, it fits big in the bust area. I have a wide bottom and hips covers the top only, if you want it longer order a size up I will be wearing shorts under a cute costume for the money would buy again."
4.0,"A little smaller than I'd like (tight around the top of the thigh), but other than that they are good"
4.0,One problem but solved😄jacket zipper<br />Problematic but solved...<br />Like the product😊
4.0,Love them!! Very comfy
4.0,"These are larger than expected. When the description stated ""oversized' I figured large but not this big. Basically these are huge - almost too large to wear. The color is good and they are well made enough but only buy these if you want seriousy big sunglasses."
4.0,"Fits just fine, it looks pretty."
4.0,Cute but kinda big
4.0,"It is very convenient to carry id, cards, badge, etc into one single pouch. I am glade to chose it product for my own convenience. However, the leather strip is little bit hard than I expected."
4.0,This show was a excellent buy. It fits perfectly and will be great for the summer
4.0,Very nice for a wedding occasion. Not cheap looking.
4.0,Good price for starter earrings.
4.0,Large felt like a small. Size up two sizes if you don’t like your clothes skin tight. But overall quality was nice and looked cute.
4.0,Stunning earrings. Much larger in person than viewed online. Unfortunately too large to wear in my forward helix. The brilliance in the settings are gorgeous though and will look amazing with a formal dress.
4.0,"This brand was really popular back in the day so I wanted to see what the hype was about.<br /><br />This bracket is pretty short. I was a little surprised. It comes with a nice black zippered pouch with the logo on it.<br /><br />It fits nicely on smaller wrists. Has some weight to it.<br />Not sure if it’ll turn my wrist green but overall for the price and look it’s not too bad. Don’t expect too much about of it than what it is, something pretty for the day-not jewelry passed down to your children like a Rolex or Cartier."
4.0,"I love the design of the swimsuit. However, unfortunately the size they thought I was going to get ended up being far too large for me to even try Aon. The material seems to be well-made and it comes in a cute zipper pouch for storage.<br /><br /> I will be returning and exchanging for a smaller size. I am a size 8-10  and when you go off of their guidelines as far as measurement goes it says that I'm a size 14 to 16 so that is what I ordered. However when it arrived it is labeled as a 4XL and was far far far too big.<br /><br /> I am going to go with my gut and order just an extra-large because I believe that it will probably be a tad bit closer to the appropriate size. So take into consideration that the measurements may not be appropriate for the size that you actually need. And maybe go with a size or two up from what you would typically buy has it, in my experience, runs small but not as small as the size chart indicates. Do not base the size that you currently are or typically wear or inches for that matter for the size that you should order I would order or suggested order a size larger than what you typically wear.<br /><br />Disclaimer-I received a swimsuit in a discounted rate in exchange for an honest unbiased review. I cannot attest to the fit or the comfort because I was unable to actually try the swimsuit on."
4.0,Demasiado caliente
4.0,"I'm writing a review because I cannot figure out how to contact the seller about this purchase.  I like the glasses very much, however, they broke after about 6 weeks of use.  As you can see from the attached photo, the ear piece on the left in the photo fell off.  It is lost on a golf course somewhere.  I liked them while they lasted.  Unfortunately, that turned out to be a very short period of time.<br /><br />Update:  The seller saw my comment and was very prompt to send me a new pair of sunglasses.  Like I said before, these are very nice glasses.  If they hold up this time, I would highly recommend them."
4.0,"I purchased this bracelet for mother. It's beautiful, she absolutely loved it and after seeing it, I loved it as well! She wears it all the time and never takes it off. My only issue is, this is the 3rd time I am purchasing the bracelet...the previous bracelets broke and she had beads all over the place. The last one I purchased was 6 months ago...not sure why this is happening. She is not doing anything to cause it to fall apart. She takes very good care of her things. It would be nice to receive a replacement instead of purchasing again."
4.0,It looks awesome and my daughter loves it but it’s a very light thin material. Definitely more of a summer night or fall day sweatshirt. Won’t keep you very warm in Midwest winters
4.0,Very cute outfit only thing is that the top runs kinda small and not much stretch to it so order up a size but other than that the shorts fit perfect I wore mine with some Huaraches overall I loved it
4.0,"Is a simple nice dress,"
4.0,"Nice concept but made for very delicate, small wrist women and/or teen."
4.0,"Love it! Bag folds small for travel but is huge when unfolded; I even managed to cram my rain jacket in the bag with books and snacks and lots of other stuff! Love the extra zipper (secure!) pocket for a cell phone on the shoulder strap and the back security pocket. The only downside is when you slide the bag around to get into it, the zipper is on the bottom so if you're not careful, stuff falls out...could be user error, though."
4.0,"Overall I like the dress and it's a good option for plus size women who are fairly short.  I am 5 ft 3 in, 210 pounds, size 38 G chest and ordered a size XL.  Typically I wear a size 16.  I did find the fabric stretched a bit tight across my chest.  It also didn't quite reach my ankles, so if you are tall this may not be a good option for you.  The material is very thin, which means I didn't find it as flattering in the back (think back fat that isn't smoothed out), but I did get lots of compliments on it.  The color is not accurately portrayed in my photo, as it is this lovely teal color.  It could be worn throughout summer because of how thin it is.  I'm not sure how it will hold up in the wash."
4.0,I have flat feet but these have no support. Rather hard sole but I wonder if over time of it conform likeburkenstocks. It is pritty but my foot slides around. I would wear them for a wedding if I wasn't in the mood for heels but not out walking all day at the stores.
4.0,Not too. A bit short and I am short so but its nice to wear around the house. I think it would fit a tall and slim person better
4.0,Good thank u
4.0,I am a size three and they were too tight. Gave them to a friend.
4.0,"5’3, 160lbs, ordered xl . Ordered for my daughter. She loved it. Comfortable and swayed nicely. Ease of wearing. Didn’t slip off. Fit the body nice. Material is lovely. Color was perfect yellow. Afterwards we washed by hand with woolite, hang dried and it dried perfectly!!! No dry cleaning needed."
4.0,"I gave these masks only 4 stars because the child size are perfect but the adult masks are huge. My son loves the print and the fit and wears them regularly to school. They are super cute and he has gotten lots of compliments. Unfortunately, the adult masks are huge and don't fit either of us. Perhaps a man's face would be better suited for the size. Overall, the 3 kid size are wonderful and I would definitely purchase again just for that reason."
4.0,A little snug but SO cute! My three year old son picked them out.
4.0,"Its large which is the fit i was going for. Did not sit well on my face so i bent the plastic things that rest on the nose and that fixed it. Frame quality is good but the lens easily scratches as it is not real polarized lenses but a layer of some sort over the lens, i just hope the layer works as well as actual polarized lenses."
4.0,The runch part is seam is way to tight by the crotch part so they don't pull completely up like you would think they should they dont actually touch your skin at the part I'm talking about other than that they cute
4.0,I love it.  I'm 5'3'' and worried it would be too long but it's not.  It isn't the best quality and probably won't survive more than a few washes.  After the first wash some of the stitching had loosened in the v-neck part of the dress. Perfect beach cover up.
4.0,"Fits a little small, but looks great"
4.0,Would have given 5 stars but it needs buttons or zippers
4.0,"Looks fine; leaving in a few days for overseas.  Suggest waiting a few months on this type of product; how can we rate it with our using it.  Again it looks fine, passport fits, seems discreet.  I will let you know if the zippers break, but give me a month or two please.  lay off the solicitations"
4.0,Pretty comfortable.  Sole is a little more firm than I expected.
4.0,Loved coat. Not warm enough for trip to Iceland.  Need to order at least a size larger
4.0,I love it.  it look so elegant.
4.0,Fits a bit snug but it is a bathing suit and it still looks good. I like that it can hide the upper fat on my thighs.
4.0,Pretty thin but still warm
4.0,"Some items were damaged, otherwise well done."
4.0,"I'm 5'10 around 150. Usually wear a 4 or a medium in pants/dresses. Got a Medium. as at least one other review mentioned. The Navy pattern wasn't as colorful as I would have liked, a lot more white. So I'll probably end up adding more navy dye to it. I was looking for a mini-dress length, like ""you almost gotta wear shorts underneath this"" kind of length and it wasn't quite that short even though I'm pretty crazy tall. Probably would have been happier with a small but that's on me."
4.0,"I went up a size like some of the reviews mentioned and it was just a little large, but was still ok.<br />I wear them for daily use and not sports, so I just wanted something comfortable and these did the trick.  They are thick so I get a little warm while wearing them, but since we have more cold months than warm months here they will be great year round.<br />I did order Fruit of the Loom Women's Cotton Pullover Sportbra (pack of 3) and I do like them a little bit better, at least for the summer, as they are lighter material.<br />In the end I'm glad I purchased these and would do it again."
4.0,"Love this flannel gown, very well made.  Could have a little more material, be a bit ""fuller."""
4.0,"I ordered the black jacket. It is a good fit which it is loose fitting. Probably a good jacket for the price, but nothing to get excited about. Wish there were more color options"
4.0,Fit and comfortable.
4.0,I bought these for work and they hold up well.
4.0,"These bras have been good, cheap, comfortable daily wear bras. I am kinda larger in the chest area and these have been great for wearing to work and on a day to day basis. They are not quite supportive enough for me to wear to the gym or on my trail runs, but you get what you pay for and this was what I wanted."
4.0,It's good shoes but need more cushion  and breathability for the  people like me who stands for the most part of the day in the day to day routine . When you wear it longer than half a day it toasts your  feet.
4.0,I wear with my mask for better protection! Great hat and removable soft shield that you can wear with other hats. The coverage of the plastic is great because it comes down low enough and wraps well on the sides and no gaps on top. The one bad thing that could make the product significantly better is if they could include a harder plastic shield in the same size to deal over the hat for those that like the harder plastic. The reason is that the softer plastic flops into your face making it hard to see. I’m constantly swatting at the plastic to get it out of my face to navigate the arrows in the grocery store (although it’s good for portability  when you need to fold). I’d pay extra to have it come with an extra cover in the same size to drape over the hat but one that’s more stiff.
4.0,Ex gf loved it. Too bad she was a tramp.
4.0,"I have three of these sweaters and love them. They are incredibly soft and warm - not as soft as cashmere - but soft enough to be Merino wool. They aren't itchy against my skin. I'm 5'3"" and weigh 125 lb. My bra size is 34 DD which really affects the sizes I need to wear. I live in California so everything I wear is in layers. I don't like for my clothes to be tight. After reading the reviews,  I got this in a large to go over a size small long sleeved t-shirt and the sweater (size large) was tighter than I like.<br /><br />This is a light weight sweater but there's nothing thin about it.<br /><br />My next layer is a size small cotton pull over sweater by St John's Bay. The sweater really does run small.<br /><br />I got it in an extra large and it’s perfect over my tee and under my cotton pullover.<br /><br />I kept the size large and wear it for dressy against my skin.<br /><br />Wool is a pain to wash so I always try to wear something under it. It's going to pill because it's a natural fiber but so far this sweater doesn't pill badly. (I store my wool sweaters with a dryer sheet folded inside and it really helps with the static.)<br /><br />The only thing not to like about these sweaters is the size."
4.0,"If you're a pear shape like me, you would need to go a size up for bottoms. I had to buy two of these in the same color. One in medium as medium fits be better on top and one in large as large shorts fit me better."
4.0,"I wear 36G bra.  I ordered according to the chart (XXL) and it is way too big.  I planned to wear it instead of a bra (don't need t for support, just for modesty) and it's too lose, I'm not sure it will stay up.  I will return for a smaller size because the product itself is good and will work when I have the correct size."
4.0,Demasiado grande ..pedí una talla M y realmente es súper holgado..
4.0,"i was surprised at how long it took to get here. amazon did an excellent job estimating the delivery time. the product was smaller than I thought it would be, but my wife liked it"
4.0,It didn’t very well
4.0,Very  comfortable dress which can be worn anywhere and dressed up for dinner.The length is perfect for me. It is just even with the knee cap.
4.0,"This dress is great to wear to work. The fabric is soft and comfortable to wear. One draw back is that my dress is not even around as the product description shows. My dress is shorter on the sides, so I wear a chiffon extension slip with it. The fabric is stretchy, but is white when stretched, so make sure to order a larger size if you are busty. I ordered one size larger than I normally wear, and it fits perfectly."
4.0,"I bought my grandson a flashlight hat a few months ago because he was really interested in flashlights and lives in a cold-winter climate. My granddaughter was more interested in it than him so I got this one for her when I saw the pink version! She was so excited to get it that she put it right on and I didn't even notice the extra features (bluetooth music speakers) until after she wore it for a day! The headlamp/flashlight is perfect; press the middle of the headlamp (like a push button) once for a normal flashlight brightness, a second time for a ""high-beam"" brightness, and a third time for an SOS blinking light. Once you press it a fourth time, it turns the lights off. The light itself is secured nicely in the hat, but not difficult at all to remove and recharge. Once my granddaughter ran the batteries dead and handed it over to me, I noticed the music option on the hat. This part was easy to set up (hold the center play button to both power on and activate the bluetooth pairing mode) and since it was a separate battery, was able to continue enjoying her hat but now with music! My granddaughter is 6 and I would say it's a good fit. My 3 year old grandson fits in to it nicely as well. I think it will continue to fit for a few more years but I would be cautious to buy this for a pre-teen (even though the description says up to 15 years old). The cleaning description also has cleaning instructions which suggests handwashing, however, there is also a section that states if you choose to put in washing machine that you put it in a bag. I think this would destroy the bluetooth speakers as well as the built in remote being that it is sewn in and not removable like the light. Because of this, I give it a four star review, otherwise, it would have been the full five."
4.0,"Lovely, affordable.  I got exactly what I ordered at an excellent price.  I just wish I had ordered slightly larger beads.  Well, at this price for this quality, I'll just budget for another Ovalbuy  purchase of bigger lapis beads!"
4.0,Nice “basic bra.” Be sure to order your size in UK. (vs US) I have purchased this brand in other styles in the past and found the the sizing was more accurate for the style. I purchased the same size as last time and the have to be returned.
4.0,Nice set. Sort of looks cheap. But its very pretty.
4.0,"Very happy with this product.  The magnets are strong and make it so much easier to wear and enjoy necklaces and bracelets that have sat neglected in my jewelry armoire for years because the lobster claw clasps were just too small and difficult to use without assistance.  Love the bling, too."
4.0,Somewhat small but the sides expand out pretty easy. My boryfriend liked them.
4.0,"I ordered small & boy, are they small! Suggest sizing up."
4.0,"The fabric is really nice and the fit is overall flattering.  However they are shorter than I would like at 5'9"".  I know they are supposed to be slightly above the ankle according to the image, but in a medium-size at 5'9"" they are hitting much higher than the image on the model for sure.  Overall very comfortable, love the addition of pockets, and the fit is flattering just would like them better if they had a longer inseam.  Wouldn't repurchase due to the length issue for taller girls."
4.0,Overall good soft shirt. Liked it enough to buy another.
4.0,"Ordered three of these for co-workers.  The arrived very quickly and were packaged well, in a nice box.  All recipients loved them, though one of them wears them down because she has a hard time keeping them climbing up.  But they're really a nice quality and a great value."
4.0,Great product. Good quality
4.0,Love the style of the dress however its not the most greatly made piece of clothing. A level under f21 if you will. But overall its still cute. Just not sure if itll hold up in a wash..
4.0,Cute swimsuit cover up.  It runs big though.
4.0,Rather snug across chest
4.0,The bracelet is beautiful. I’m not sure if the actual stones are real on the lotus bracelet because they seem to be more bead-like than stones. The hematite seems to be most authentic due to them being a lot more heavier but again I’m unsure. The lava diffuser bracelet works and is nice. Packing was ok. The lotus had a lot of white stuff I had to clean off before wearing. Overall it’s a nice purchase and I have received compliments on it. For the price I can’t complain if it’s not real.
4.0,Socks tend to fall below the knees after a few minutes.
4.0,Cute and versatile. I especially like the more elaborate ones in 8mm. The plainer ones are a little too small for me in this size. With that in mind I would buy from Blulu again.
4.0,"I like this style and I bought it in white and black. I can wear them with dress slacks or jeans, the fabric is reasonably thick, not thin."
4.0,"Like the adjustable ear loops. Masks are bit big but comfortable when adjusted. However they smell kinda funny. Washed a few times, but still have weird smell to them."
4.0,"Arrived before time, I have this items for gift. I am happy with my order."
4.0,Nice but thinly made
4.0,"i’m in between sizes and sized up, the top still works fine but i wish the bottom part was a little tighter. if you’re in between sizes go down! other than that i love it!"
4.0,Super cute- pants are long and the waistband is a little tight with the thin elastic
4.0,This was a gift.  The person who received this bag said it is perfect for taking to the gym.  It holds all the items he needs and is very versatile.  Would also make a great weekend/travel bag.  Nicely made!
4.0,I really loved the dress. I read multiple reviews before purchasing and everything everyone said was right on the money. I am just shy of 5ft. tall and I weigh about 148lbs and I purchased a medium (8/10). The length was perfect with my heels on. The only downside was that I had to constantly pull the dress up over my boobs. This problem could probably be avoided with the proper bra but I didn't have time to get one. I got so many complements and no one knew I only paid $22 and ordered it off of Amazon. This dress is definitely great in a pinch if you need a formal gown.
4.0,Loved the color on my skin. I’m 5’9” and typically would order an XL. This dress came in a large and I could’ve gotten a medium. It runs big. I will order in black too.
4.0,my husband is happy with it
4.0,"A little tight in the bust, nut not too bad. Part of my crossdressing wardrobe."
4.0,I really like these glasses! I do have to warn people that they are very large for sunglasses. It is a cute look but was not expecting that. Other than that they are very lightweight and very chic. They look and feel like expensive glasses as well and have deep blue tinting for sunny days! All in all I think this is a wonderful product at an amazing price!
4.0,"I was very imressed with the quality of this swimwear, especially since the price was about half of what similar items from brand names on here were going for...  Don't know if the quality will last since obviously time will tell, but I am very satisfied."
4.0,Inexpensive but good enough quality for moderate use. I used mine to dress a nine foot tall skeleton dinosaur for Valentine’s Day.
4.0,The balls were a little hard to get off but they fit great would deff order again
4.0,"I took off the tag and it got a ltt hole. It fits nice, ltt rough material. Sparkles, with white painted stars."
4.0,This jackets warm but it dose have a few short comings.<br />1st is it super thin east to rip I'm guessing<br />2rd the hood is far to big dose have a wire and can fold it up<br />3rd it's a big jacket pockets go to my elbows.<br />4th weak wrist protection.<br /><br />Pros<br />Super warm! It's 24º out in Washington and I only got a t shirt underneath and totally fine.<br />Lightweight lighter then a sweatshirt.<br />It's warm and that all I really wanted it to be its my cold dry night jacket.<br /><br />Over all I'm happy with it
4.0,"Fits true to size. I ordered a size down from what I wanted due to reviews suggesting they fit on the larger side, but mine was true to size. The material is very soft."
4.0,Just wish it had snaps in the crotch.
4.0,"This is a great dress. The material is not thick, and is a good weight. However, the fit/sizing is a bit off. If you normally wear a size medium, like I do, you need to order two sizes up. The extra large fits like a medium for me.  All in all, I like this dress, and it is perfect for the office."
4.0,"Very festive!  The bells are not too loud - thank goodness, since they are right next to my ears!"
4.0,"Loved the top. Well made and looked like something from Free People/Anthro/Altar'd State.... unfortunately, it was just too boxy of a fit for my body type. I am tall (5'9) with a slender/longer torso. Not super flattering, it made me look like I had a huge torso and tiny little birdy legs."
4.0,"Runs big, need to get a medium… ordered large because… those brands usually run small… but nice, decent fabric"
4.0,"I had to have this dress shortened several inches so that it would hit just above my knee (I'm 5' 1&#34;). I paid about as much to the tailor as I did on the dress. It's definitely body-conscious and the fabric is a little thin, so you'll want a good-quality seamless girdle to hold in your tummy pooch (if you have one). Other than that, I really like it."
4.0,"These boots are adorable on my grandchild. They seem well made, durable, and will last until she out grows them and possibly longer. They are just as pictured but run small. My granddaughter wears a size 10 but fortunately I purchased a size 11 and they fit perfectly for now. Fast shipping, well packaged, and great price. Thank you."
4.0,"These work as advertised. My only concern/issue with them is that the split is unnatural, so the fabric twists. This causes it to become a bit uncomfortable. The adjustable strap also digs into my legs when I sit down because they have a tendency to press down onto the pant legs...natural mechanics of it all really. The buckle then digs into my legs and it is very uncomfortable, especially when it twists due to the split having a natural tendency to do so. Hard to blame the product because it's the design. It looks good, but the split should be sewn together and there should be something other than a metal buckle to make necessary adjustments.<br /><br />I gave it a four because it works. I am currently looking for something more comfortable. I may just go back to having 4 separate pieces because it works great too and it doesn't dig into my legs when seated."
4.0,It's nice.  A little thin and smaller than expected but still acceptable.
4.0,"I bought this to wear this year, as good luck as I'm year of the tiger. (it's supposed to be bad luck on your Chinese zodiac year, but you can cancel it out by wearing red)<br /><br />I'm also allergic to metal, so wanted something with no metal that I can wear all year long. I'm not superstitious normally, but these last two years have made me nervous, and for under 20 dollars why risk it.<br /><br />The cord shortens enough to be a choker, and it's not very obtrusive. The stone is a duller orange red, but that's expected with stone (stones are not the same color, you will likely get a different color than the one pictured) Close enough to red to count."
4.0,"Love it! It's seethrough but as long as you have a slip on underneath, it's fine."
4.0,The picture makes it look floor length but it hit me at mid calf. Not what expected but nice quality
4.0,"They aren't kidding when they say &#34;super long&#34;! They hang down onto my shoulders a couple inches.... Good quality though, and kind of shiny glam. Wore them with a black, edgy dress for a wedding and they looked great. But, but sure how often I can wear them again because they hang so far down onto my shoulders so you have to find a shirt/dress that that looks OK with. Overall I like them though!"
4.0,Awesome flexibility
4.0,Nice quality product but shorter than expected.  Comes an 1.5&#34; above his knees rather than to/at them.
4.0,"It's a great suit, but no coverage for the ta ta's."
4.0,"The material is very nice and comfortable. Be sure to use the size chart if you want a perfect fit. The color on these are vibrant, very stylish. The crotch area is made to fit comfortably as well."
4.0,fleece pills somewhat at first
4.0,"Very good look. Fit is decent but they do tend to drift downward in back over time. Of course, they won't be on very long after you are seen wearing them."
4.0,"I have had these glasses for quite some time now, they are large frame glasses, made well and very stylish.<br />Would definitely recommend to others and cant beat the price!  I do think they would look better on someone who doesn't have a round face.  They look ok on me, but I think if you have anything other than a round face you would Rock them, in my opinion."
4.0,"Are these something you will wear to dress up? No, but they are great for any casual outfit you wear. The designs are repeated in gold and silver tones so there aren't 56 different designs but even still you get a decent variety."
4.0,Great oversized glasses for eye protection and very classic style. Great buy!
4.0,You get what you pay for lol that's all I'm saying haha but the manager is super awesome and nice guy.
4.0,I wish a chain were suggested that matched the &#34;off silver&#34; look on the pendant.  I bought a regular silver chain and it doesn't match.
4.0,"Not quite as good a Duffle Bag as I was hoping it would be, but it does the job: holds my shoes, socks, shorts, and water bottle.The fabric seems a bit thin, but time will tell if it's sturdy enough. Considering it isn't getting tossed into any airplane cargo holds and not being tossed down any chutes of any kind, it will probably last for years."
4.0,Don't charge very well. They are a bit bulky. Decent product though. They definitely last.
4.0,Go a size or 2 bigger than you normally would.
4.0,"I have to say that they are a really cute pair of earrings, but they also looked like a lump of grapes hamging from my ear. They were well made and really cute, but it wasnt the look i was going for, so i returned the utem, which was a really easy and fast process."
4.0,"It's suitable for what i need as a Halloween costume.  Very flimsy, and see thru. Is as pictured no shape just hangs. Plenty of material. Good for beach to put on and go out in public."
4.0,"For the price the quality is good and it made for some very cute pictures. It runs a little large, was big for my newborn but we made it work for pictures."
4.0,"Its a great value for the money paid. Taking away one star since the light sucks. Very difficult to read the time in the dark with the weak light. Otherwise, its a good watch for what you pay."
4.0,"I haven't worn this yet, so I can't give a full description of it. It is pretty, not quite what I expected, but nice just the same."
4.0,"it simply nice but very small .<br /><br />same the shape and figure :_)<br />like the design and the style , perfect for young girls"
4.0,"This is a really nice bag! I have really enjoyed it, but the strap is a little snug for bigger busts. I'm a 40 F and I can use it as a cross body, but it would look and feel much better if the strap could extend another inch or two. It's a bit snug."
4.0,Fits our 4 year old and 9 year old thanks to the long and adjustable elastic bands. They are cotton and were put in our upon inital wash. They didn't shrink much at all. The pint still looks great and they fit good. Now we have masks for most any occasion and these are soft on their faces. My only complaint is the adjustment beads for the elastic are huge and hurt their ears if they wear a beanie hat or ear muffs during the winter months.
4.0,I purchased this  for my father and he loves it. He can only wear it on the very last setting
4.0,"It's  sexy and classy.fits well  ..it can be worn for different occassions ,wore to a graduation .."
4.0,user thinks it is a little too big
4.0,Didn't expect it to be sooo big and roomy.  Love the color and the look of the Kipling collection.  I'd definitely recommend it to anyone who needs a bag for anything and everything.
4.0,not the best quality but ok for the price
4.0,"I got a 3x, fits more like a large. So you definitely want to go bigger. Lighting in my photo is bad, it is the tealish green of dekus costume. Lightweight fabric nylony"
4.0,I am in the healthcare field and try to wear these for every patient encounter as an extra level of protection. I like how stylish they look but was a bit disappointed with how loose fitting they are. I haven't attempted to tighten yet but hope I can. They fit around the nose ok and sit well but the temple tips are loose on the ears making the glasses fall. At that point there's no point in wearing them as they aren't providing any protection.
4.0,[[VIDEOID:6d0385d4ee99457f99c54ff0fcc32161]] Love the comfort of the shirt. Dislike stitching on one arm and long sleeves past hands.
4.0,"These are pretty nice slippers. When they arrived, though, they did have a sort of strong &#34;new&#34; smell, so we left them in another room for a few days to air out. After that, they were okay as far as the smell goes. They do fit fine without socks, but with my husband's thicker socks, they feel too tight, he says. Overall, he's happy with them."
4.0,This is just a regular normal everyday wear it's okay when I got it it took longer than it was supposed to but I guess that happens sometimes
4.0,Good quality runs a little bit smaller than normal
4.0,This is above top but a little snug!  Going to lose weight by exercising!  Hope to wear it loosely soon!
4.0,"This is a nice sock. Nothing to brag about but nothing to complain either. It is comfortable,  holds its shape, breathable and looks nice."
4.0,"It's a beautiful dress. I have yet to wear it out. I love the floral patterns and length of the dress. The material is good, I only wish it were a little stretchy. Other than that, I can't wait to wear it."
4.0,"I received these cute boots quickly. They look great and seem to be very good quality. The seller, Western Outlets, shipped them promptly; I would order from them again!"
4.0,This is so cozy!!!!! I live the color and how fluffy it is. My only issue is the sleeves are a little on the short side but overall it’s great!
4.0,"Based on other reviews I ordered a size up, and in doing so I have a dress that is a little too big. I'm going to have to take it in but otherwise it's a nice dress."
4.0,These are really comfy & looks like they’ll hold up well but I got blisters because I think I ordered too large a size.  My mistake.
4.0,If you're large on top it hides back fat
4.0,"Comfortable dress , Beautiful and good quality fabric but runs too large."
4.0,The dragonfly is very small.  It is a pretty necklace but I am giving it to my granddaughter.
4.0,I like to glasses and how clear everything appears while wearing them. The frames are very flexible so hopefully this means they'll last a long time. I did receive this item for a discount for posting an honest review. If I encounter any issues I will update this review.
4.0,"Product arrived quickly and as seen in photos! I am having fun with using the midi rings, but the other 3 rings are not as adjustable as I would have preferred. They don't fit my small fingers. That said, it's a good set for those who have bigger fingers (my finger sizes range from 3-6)."
4.0,"The foot fits well, but the socks are tight in the calf."
4.0,Used this product for work as well as work
4.0,"This product is very warm and soft. It is large enough to be used as a shawl. The edges look a tad unfinished (see picture) but I'm not familiar with Pashmina shawls, and it might be just how they are supposed to look. It is not 100% wool (according to the seller it is 50% polyester), but still a good product for the price."
4.0,"I like this product, it’s sturdy and has even held up being in an outdoor environment for over 10 days, with no fading or tearing.<br /><br />UPDATE:<br />As of June 2021, my lanyard finally started to tear. The stitching is now coming a loose. But it’s held up well considering the conditions I’ve had it in over the last few months. Gonna try and get it re-sewed with a strong stitch."
4.0,This was a gift for a friend that just bought her 1st home. She loved and really like the saying on the back.
4.0,Siize its too small
4.0,Very comfortable and received a lot of compliments.
4.0,"I ordered my correct size, but it runs small."
4.0,...I got a nice pair of loupes. I am not a professional when it comes determining the accurate strength of the lenses. But I do know they might not be 30x. The lens does help magnify tiny prints much better than a regular magnifying 5x glass but it's not the same grade as the lens they use at the jewelry place.<br />It does have a bit of rough edges from the finishing. But that can be taken care of with a buffing pad. The shipping was quick.
4.0,Son loves them but they do run 1/2 size small so won't last very long.
4.0,It's a really thin material but soft. It's tighter then I wanted but I can still wear it.
4.0,"Looks like the picture, soft and comfortable. A nice pair of sweatpants to have for the price."
4.0,The jackets are cute. We ordered them for a sock hop. The sleeves are more for a petite size women. Somewhat short. Otherwise the fit is okay. The jacket is very thin material but is suitable for a one time or an occassional use as a part of a costume.
4.0,I’ve had 2 of these bands and also bought one for my husband. They are easy to put on and attractive but every one has had rough places that snag your clothing.
4.0,"Cooll wristband, little large so I had to cut it and reglue it bit of a pain but that’s not their fault"
4.0,"The lining fits as expected, but the outer layer is oversized, but still cute if worn with the right look."
4.0,Great price<br />Decent compression shirt<br />Would purchase again
4.0,I get a lot of compliments on this lanyard
4.0,"A little snug, but a great buy!"
4.0,"This robe is incredibly soft and comfortable. It would be perfect if it was a smidge  longer. However, it feels wonderful to slip into it! And the soft blue color is really nice and calming. The material is not really thick, but it still keeps me warm and snuggly."
4.0,The fit is a little snug for my big head but is acceptable. The hat is exactly what it said it is; the material is a soft weave that does not scratch or break; the brim is firm & sufficiently wide even for FL.
4.0,"Fits small , but well made I got it to cover my mouth while riding my bike to work , good to keep around for cold rainy days."
4.0,"Nice shirt, good price.  Needs ironing after washing according to insructions....not just a touch up."
4.0,"This pack is well made, handles a small camera in the lower compartment (I use a Sony RX10 III, filters, batteries and the like) and room for a sweater, snacks and the like in the upper compartment.  Personally,I like the access in the back as I can lay the pack down keeping the straps clean and no one is going to steel anything while you have it on.  The only limitation for me is that the fasteners on the sides are too small to attach my travel tripod.."
4.0,Love this purse it's just what I expected! The wallet is poorly made and doesn't fit my check book in it but the purse is awesome!!
4.0,Great gi!
4.0,Love the bag but handle broke the first week I uses it
4.0,Very cute. 11&#34; was too long for my ankle so I tied a knot in it. Looks cute on. 4 stars because the hamsa hand doesn't look like it at all. Still cute.
4.0,Bought this dress for a party I'll be attending in FL. Paired it with a red belt as I will be wearing red pumps. It's quite comfy &amp; the material is better than I expected. Didn't give all 5 stars because I didn't fancy the belt it initially came with.
4.0,Had them in my pocket and the arm just shaped in half. Very fragile
4.0,"I use this product for the gym, the fit is ok just a little too loose and long for my liking"
4.0,This wallet is smooth high quality leather that fits perfect in my front pocket
4.0,The costume was great! Only downside was the length of the costume from butt to shoulders. I am 6’3” and the costume was just a bit too small. The bottom part of the jumpsuit was pulling on my groin when i put the shoulders on lol. Very good quality suit though.
4.0,"Smaller than expected,  but otherwise good."
4.0,"Too short for me. I'm 6'2"""
4.0,"Just a little small, but I should have expected that"
4.0,Bought these for my boyfriend. They're not tight nor do they pinch his nose so he's happy.
4.0,not thin and flimsy; pills a bit after 3 months of wash and wear
4.0,needed some economical hip boots for occasional use and these work just fine. Fit as expected
4.0,The fur ball is a snap on and the navy blue hat doesn’t stay snapped..keeps popping off like the marmalade maniac lol
4.0,This handbag is a nice large size. The side buckles can be adjusted to round out the bag and make it smaller or larger. Only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is because I thought I was getting a purple bag but the color is BROWN .
4.0,Take them off every once and awhile
4.0,Love the dress. I ordered a large because I wasn’t sure how much stretch the dress had. I could have ordered a medium.  I wanted a tighter fit but overall I loved the dress.
4.0,Love the hinged earrings
4.0,This was somewhat large upon arrival (running it through the washer and dryer slightly shrunk it though) and it does run a bit longer on the woman than I had expected but it is an excellent addition to the closet and is a very beautiful dress! It will shrink slightly after the first run through the laundry so be aware of that... Good price for the quality and material though!
4.0,Very beautiful item unfortunately not as long as pictured
4.0,"These scarves are stunningly beautiful. I purchased them for stylish headscarves for travel; however, they are very ""slick"" and will not stay in place. If I wore neck scarves, I would keep these, but will need to return them since they do not meet my needs."
4.0,"T-shirt is too big, but for the beach is nice.  The material does not look cheap."
4.0,"I really like this skirt.  I thought i had ordered large enough, but I didn't and had to return it."
4.0,"great, simple - soaks up lotions and creams quickly, has to be washed pretty often if wearing every night"
4.0,Nice for a costume.  You may need to wear a vest or belt if you are not thin through the stomach area.
4.0,"They are great glasses. I just expected the frames to be a dark grey, not light."
4.0,"Very nice, soft leather, love it"
4.0,Wayyy too small all the sizes look small none are bigger than the other however good quality
4.0,"I bought these for trail riding , they fit over my glasses well and stay in place , definitely brightens up the trail in the dark and shady places. Good product for price"
4.0,Great kayak pants i have 2 pairs now nice flexible material and water proof 4 stars only because the zipper on one pair has lost a couple of teeth towards the top
4.0,I like the dress but is not a great quality but for a casual day is nice. I order a L and it was ok but A little small in the breast area. I am size 36D and 14.
4.0,"I took off the buttons, they were poorly sewn on and didn't add anything to the look. The skirt is long so it should be paired with a 25-26&#34; petticoat."
4.0,"So, I felt a little duped by the pictures as when I opened the package I saw that the watch was actually white. I guess I was expecting silver or stainless steel look. As far as the actual watch goes, it's large and reminds me of one I had in the late 90s early 00's. It's all rubber, and is adjustable. I keeps the time and also has a digital display.<br />Overall, I was a little disappointed by the misleading pictures, but if you are looking for an oversized white watch that looks decent, keeps time well, and also has a digital display, this may be the watch for you."
4.0,Beautiful little owls for the price that they are the only bad thing I have to say about them as that the metal Peg on the back of the owls was bent upon arrival but was easily straightened other than that there have been no issues with them no discoloration of my girlfriend's ears or anything.
4.0,I like it although it doesn't totally look like the picture which shows it more flowy. It's more of an A line dress
4.0,"The back piece is screwed on like a cork not just pushed together like a regular earring. But otherwise, it's nice"
4.0,"So this fit like a small, but the bust area was in my armpits. I had to remove the pads and it works fine. There’s no support, so I wear a bikini top/sports bra depending on activity underneath. Haven’t been sunburned and washes well. Bought small, 33-26-34 @ 123 lbs"
4.0,"So these are beautiful in person. A little heavier than I wanted, which is why I would give 4 stars and not 5. I would buy them again and this is my second order from orchid. I definitely recommend"
4.0,"Very nice dresses. The hey are cool, airy and for t well. They are also very beautiful snd well worth the price. I purchased about six in different car Lord. M very happy with my dresses"
4.0,"looks nice, but looks plastic."
4.0,Bill of the Hat is a little narrow; Nice Embroidery job;
4.0,Looks Great and seems to be durable; good price.
4.0,"The necklace very sturdy and strong, I am 5-6 tall and 24"" was perfect for my neck. I really love this necklace but is too shiny and it looks like female necklace and very thin. I'm afraid to wear it, so I gave it to my sister, she loves it as well. I'm a little disappointed because the description didn't specifically describe about this necklace whether is for female or male."
4.0,Look great but one broke already. I was able to fix it with my homie gorilla glue and looks just fine now.
4.0,Bonus Daughter loved it! Very well made!
4.0,4 star due to sqr neck wide & only a certain type of Bra will work without showing. Nice look & quality for the price.My wife is satisfied with the purchase.
4.0,Yes<br />Lots Of. Different kinds
4.0,The fabric of the tunic is a bit more clingy than shown in the photo. Not sure if buying a larger size would solve the problem since the overall fit was ok. Color is more on the beige side but overall will look nice with leggings & boots.
4.0,I just think my expectations were higher than they should've been but it's not a bad purchase. I don't regret it too much it looks nice and simple
4.0,These tee shirts fit great and are comfortable. I usually wear a medium and they were out so I ordered a large and it fits great
4.0,We love Disney things in this house and these were super cute. The headband was large enough for adults to wear too - and it does have some give - but might dig in a little on larger heads. Overall a fun and festive Disney type option!
4.0,for the most part it is fine . I am tall so the sleeves are a little short + a lower neck line would make it more versatile.
4.0,"This sweater would be great for a shorter person. Color: great (apricot), material: great (very soft), overall fit to size ordered. EXCEPT: this sweater is cut very short, almost crop style. Not good for me; 5'10"". Had to return. Credit came next day, and sweater is on its way back.  Would be 5 star but picture is not of a cropped style sweater."
4.0,The ear rings are beautiful and true to size and color.  I ordered 2 pairs one for a friend as we have matching outfits and the color is  a perfect color.
4.0,"Goggles fit very nicely and very comfortable, love them for either pool swim or open water swim ,have worn both places."
4.0,"This is a beautiful chain.  It feels substantial and looks very nice on.  I have a shepherd's whistle hanging from it which all together looks really nice. As far as looks go I think in general I prefer my round 3mm snake chain to this one, but this one comes a close second.<br /><br />The reason I deducted one star is because of the finishing....  the end caps on the chain (the part that the jump ring and lobster clasp attach to) seem a bit flimsy.  They are soldered to the end of the chain in two spots as opposed to being a cap that fits over the ends of the chain and then soldered in place,  I also find the end caps to be more attractive than the way this one is finished.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE:  A beautiful necklace.  Substantial.  Can be worn alone or with a pendant.  I just don't love the way the ends are finished which is the only reason I am deducting one star."
4.0,Good fit product. Doesn't stick to your body!
4.0,The craftsmanship appears to be good.  The Large ran on the medium side for a typical large.
4.0,Very cute and easy to wear. They are great for hot days.The only down side is they wrinkle easily.
4.0,"I love the tank, but it is a bit snug. Defds get a size bigger."
4.0,The chokers are great and durable and I haven’t had any problems
4.0,They look nice and are quite sturdy. Yet they tend to glare a bit and it gets foggy sometimes.
4.0,"Fast delivery. Wristlet is what a expected. Material very soft. Not crazy about the brown colored I ordered. Very roomy. Fits iPhone, keys, glasses and lipstick. All my essentials."
4.0,I love the shirt/necklace combo.
4.0,I like the secure ability that the metal ties are.
4.0,definitely keeps the feet toasty. If you have a sweaty foot problem these would not be a product for you.
4.0,The top fits fine. The bottoms are too small. I am 5ft 8. 160 pda and ordered a large. Should have ordered an XL.
4.0,Item arrived exactly as advertised. Prompt delivery.
4.0,"Material is a bit on the thin side. Not bad for summer months, but not ideal for cold winter climate. Length and sizing seems good."
4.0,Had to return for a smaller size. Went with most reviewers and bought per the size chart and I had to go two sizes down.
4.0,"I forgot I just didn’t realize it was racer back, thought it was stank top."
4.0,I really like these shoes.  They are comfortable however the size is a little odd for me. It fit a little loose and it rubbed against the back of my foot (achilles area) it bothered a little but it eventually stopped bothering after a couple of uses. While it was annoying at first that the back rubbed they are very comfortable especially helped with my knee problems.
4.0,"The material of this shirt is so soft and on the thin side. I am 5'3&#34; and it jyst covers my butt (thankfully). I did find the shirt to be a little big. I am a 40C and the large is a little big, but still comfortable."
4.0,Just the size is not too good is Small
4.0,This piece is very delicate and smaller than what I imagined.
4.0,"I love the fabric! So soft and light! However, for someone who’s only 5’2 it’s slightly too large/long."
4.0,Wish it was a little bigger
4.0,The overall look and feel is great. But the closing is sooooo tedious. The peg or what ever you want to call it kept bypassing the hole and it made putting them on a two person job.
4.0,"I love these earrings, and I'm so glad that I ordered them. They are a bit bigger than I hoped they would be, though."
4.0,"I have to say right away this is a great sweater jacket, loved everything about it but size does run small!!! I normally wear a 2XL I ordered a 3XL but it was too small so I had to send it back."
4.0,"Nice blouse and unique. Material is nice and soft, colors are pretty. The neck strings are a little big and tend to bunch slightly and under the arms/sleeves where the seam is appears a little oddly placed but I think that is just the way it is made in order for it to hang correctly. The fit itself is nice and it is the perfect length, also it is prettier on than in the picture. I also like how they have multiple colors.  Overall I am pleased"
4.0,"I'm 5' 3&#34;, 124 lbs -- I got this in medium, and it great fit, including the length.  Be aware, the fabric is thin... not see-through, but it does show every little bump.  Very comfortable."
4.0,"They are attractive and comfortable, but a little smaller than expected."
4.0,"Got these for my husband for Christmas he absolutely love them! They are fun, colorful and he  said They are comfortable and he really like the height of them. So they’re a good buy. I’d recommend."
4.0,The dress is really comfy and looks nice for a casual dress or you can dress it up with some heels. I am 5’0 140 pounds and the M fits kind of loose ! I think I scoops have gotten a small but the M looks ok.
4.0,"I bought these to replace scratched lenses in my oakleys.  The lens is the most expensive part of the glasses.  For less than one set of lenses, I received two.  The polarization seems not as smooth as oakleys.  It's a great deal, just slightly poorer quality."
4.0,"Very comfy, but the waistband is narrow"
4.0,"Not a bad suit for this cheaper price than normal ($45)....if I had paid the usual price for this brand of suit I would be sending it back. It kind of flattens your chest out and it has no real compression. Also, the tie is very long on the side. But my daughter loved it on me and says she likes the tie so I’m keeping it."
4.0,"I followed the size chart and got the size I thought would be ok for 40 in bust, but it’s still too tight.  Also, I am short - 5’ 2” - and it is barely long enough to be decent.  (Do not raise your arms!)  I do love that it is lined, and such a cute, classic style."
4.0,"Very nice, heavy tight knit.  Would be warmer if I could actually pull it together, but it runs very narrow for the size."
4.0,I like that these have the pocket design which is rarely seen. Zippered sweatshirt pockets are the way to go!!! Why is this not commonplace?! Either way I love it. I did not like the racecar arm stripe on the sleeves but that's just an aesthetic opinion. Overall I am content
4.0,Light weight for summer and hopefully better than tryin to not get over heated in a mask!
4.0,The inside zipper is fake and thats the one i use the most.
4.0,I love the cut of this dress and the pockets. My only dislike is that the white fabric isn't quite thick enough so I have to make sure I'm wearing beige / nude underwear or else you can easily see it. The side zipper is so much nicer than a back zipper and the scoop neck shows just enough cleavage to be attractive but not having to constantly worry about pulling up the dress.
4.0,"I wear vintage watches only and this compliments the style of one specific piece that I have perfectly ... AND delivered on time, appropriately protected/packaged ..."
4.0,OK but dark background leaves little contrast with numeral indicators...not enough contrast for my aging eyes...
4.0,"I love these ring covers and the people that sell it. My engagement ring is a 5 karat tanzanite stone and I didn't know until years later that this is a softer stone and I had been scratching it constantly. The covers are really comfortable and really do help. I initially purchased the medium sized covers but they were too small. I contacted the company and within a day they were sending me the next size up! The customer service was absolutely amazing, so to have a good/needed product with a company that is on top of everything, you can't ask for anything else. The only reason I gave it a 4 instead of 5 is because the space for the stones should come in an option for more vertical rings (mine looks like Princess Kate's) rather than stones that go horizontal  and wrap around the finger. Either way, give this product a try!!"
4.0,The sunglasses are definitely more white than they are off-white as shown in the pictures! She isn't actually really good for my more round face but they i'm not too tight and don't cause headaches!
4.0,Day of Dead
4.0,"Jacket is okay I guess, we didn't get to test it in Fargo ND this Valentine's day because the small is huge... Hilariously huge. My boyfriend is a small guy but this was not even in the realm of ""this is a common problem, I can make it work"" is was a hard no as the sleeves went down past his fingertips."
4.0,"Cuatro estrellas,pedi talla small y me enviaron talla M&#34; but it's ok it fit good"
4.0,i really like this dress and i love the price
4.0,"Cute style. Bottom is an oval so it will “sit” without falling over and you can open the mouth wide to see inside. Zipper is a little rough. Beautiful fuchsia color. Since the material is stiff the dimensions while accurate do not compare to a similar sized cloth purse like Vera Bradley since cloth has a lot of flexibility and “give”.  This is for my daughter who only carries a small pouch as wallet, car keys, tissues, small phone and sunglasses. Hopefully with use the material will soften a bit."
4.0,"Really nice watch. Stylish. Hard to see time in direct sunlight though, but usually that's not much of a problem. Really comfortable to wear. Sometimes it pops off, so watch for that, but it's really easy to fix when it does. It's a good watch."
4.0,This swimsuit worked really well for my Vegas trip ordered an LX based on suggestions. I'm 5'8&#34; 150lbs with 36D chest. Fit my chest perfect but the bottom half was HUGE. Ended up getting it fitted for $15 and it turned out really nice.
4.0,"Love this dress! I am 5'5, 135 with 34G (breastfeeding) chest and it fits really well and isn't too revealing, just a little long. I got a medium."
4.0,"Quality is great! It is a &#34;one size&#34; and a little snug (5'7&#34;, 168) Definitely too short for a dress. It will be really cute with jeans and boots. Keeper!"
4.0,"Overall the product was really nice. It shipped fast, was clean and not damaged. It looked just like the picture and would have been very comfortable. However they do run small so I’m only giving 4 stars and will be returning the shoes."
4.0,I couldn't get them all the way up on my first time wearing them but the second time i put them on they fit just fine just a warning they might need to be stretched out a bit for the proper fit
4.0,"Love the t-shirt but the printed design is already chipping away after a couple of washes. Not too mad about it though. When the design is all gone, I will still have a soft comfortable t-shirt that fits well... and I love the purple."
4.0,I received many compliments. It is a smooth print not gaudy.
4.0,"These are very wide, lots of material, so it takes up a good portion of your head which is either a good thing or bad, depending on your purpose. For summer these are kind of hot, so they will work better in the winter.  It's got good strong elastic that hugs the head and doesn't move around much. It's a luxurious well-made fabric."
4.0,"I love this hat, and it is so cute, comfy, and warm. I am pleasantly surprised by the quality for the price point.  I am buying more in different colors."
4.0,Works as a clip on Pandora bracelet
4.0,Cute pendant. But very long delivery
4.0,I have been using this blender for a little over a year. I think this does exactly what it is ment for. I have been making smoothies with this from work. I love how portable and easy to use it is. There are only two things I dislike about this product. I cant put frozen fruit in because it's not powerful enough to break it up. Also the lids start to get moldy under the seals. And they did not sell replacement lids. I havent used it in a while because I dont want to buy a whole product for new lids. Other smoothie companies sell replacement lids I've noticed.
4.0,"We haven't had any rain yet, but the fit is roomier than I expected for an Asian product and it is very well made. I am very pleased. My daughter loves how cute it is."
4.0,Its good but get next size up u need.  Large fit like medium
4.0,"Had some issues trying to figure out how to use the tools to adjust the band to my size. But once I figured it out the change out went quickly. And it's nice to know that if at some point I'll need to enlarge it again, I will know how"
4.0,"This material is soft and looks cute. So awesome that it has the secret pocket. My only real complaint is how thin and small the scarf itself is...definitely not for winter, more of a cute outfit addition."
4.0,"Coat is a slightly long for a 5""fter, but it's warm! I like that! Worth my husband's purchase for me!! Thanks.."
4.0,"Too much if you just need like belly rings, eyebrow, or just one type of thing and some of sizes were off."
4.0,"This dress is really pretty. The fabric is light and airy and the details are just as nice as the photo. I wish the built-in lining were beige instead of white, because it shows through with a clear line where it ends."
4.0,Not as sn\mall as I expected for newborn.
4.0,No están mal para su precio.
4.0,"I love the style of these boots and they are comfortable with good arch support and wedge heel, but as others have noted they are hard to get on, I ordered a 6.5M but I have a narrow foot so I can pull on ok but not easily. I am not sure about keeping yet but I do love the style. 4 stars for style and comfort."
4.0,Todo bien con este producto lo recomiendo
4.0,They're lovely but a little small.
4.0,I kinda like these house shoes. They are big and guess one size fits all. I can easily see how these can fit a man even tho I only wear a size 8. They are well made and cute and plush. They stay on your feet without your foot coming up out of them cuz they tie. Really nice for the price
4.0,"I didn't realize these shoes don't have GorTex lining, so they're not waterproof. I use them as daily shoes and for hiking.  I'll look for a different pair with GorTex for trail use.  I like the color and the speed lacing system.  They provide enough cushioning for all day use.  I prefer the mid-ankle height to full size boots."
4.0,So far so good. I’ve only used it once and so far no zippers have broken and no rips.
4.0,I loved the dress :) Perfect for maternity.
4.0,"For some reason, the heading says, ""Earrings for Girls.""  Admittedly the price is low and these are not the highest quality of any earrings I have purchased for my wife, but she sure likes them.  The pictures, neither mine nor the ones on Amazon, do the earrings justice.<br /><br />Yes, you can give these to your little girl, or your big one and be a hit either way.  One warning, if you wear these and a lanyard for glasses, they may get hooked into the lanyard, so be careful."
4.0,Larger than expected  very pretty
4.0,"Very Skinny tie, nice print though"
4.0,Fit as expected & good all-around bike short
4.0,Some turn colors and deteriorate and then become uncomfortable/ itchy once that happens. But since theres so many I just swap it out with another one after the fact. Some dont stay put that well. But for the most part they're cute and fun
4.0,"Awesome earrings. I bought these for a friend who owns a steven universe au with me because her main gemsona is a black pearl and these look so great on her! Theyre cute, a little big, but very cute! I might buy a pair for myself! theyre so cute!"
4.0,Just ok. Not as blue as I'd hoped. More turquoise - which I don't get into.
4.0,"I like it but, it’s slightly different from the picture., not as  bright and shiny as the picture,. It has a dull gray look to it but still nice tho."
4.0,"I bought this dress to wear to a ballet. It arrived on time but ultimately I had to return it because it was too small. I found the material to cling too tightly. I am 5’10 and weigh about 230 pounds, I ordered the 5X and would have needed probably 2-3 sizes larger. Other than that, I would have kept the dress, It’s a really beautiful color and the sleeves are pretty."
4.0,They were a gift for someone and I think they are perfect.
4.0,Good at the right price!
4.0,"Great case and reasonable price.  Design was not as bright as displayed, colors are faded.  Otherwise, great product!"
4.0,"Nice long necklace perfect with a long tunic top.  In my opinion, it looks a little cheap so I wouldn't wear it to the office but it is good enough for casual weekend wear."
4.0,"Only worn it once so far, but I like it."
4.0,"I like this bow tie quite a lot.  It isn't quite the same red in person as pictured, having a slightly darker and slightly more orange red in person but it still looks nice.  The silk material is very attractive and has a nice weight.  I am docking one star because the back of the tie had some pulled threads out of the box, but after cutting those off I don't think it will hurt the tie.  The tie square and cuff links match perfectly.  Overall a really nice looking tie set at a reasonable price."
4.0,Fits pretty loose.
4.0,Definitely ordered 1 size down based on the reviews.  I'm usually a small and ordered xs and it could still be just a bit smaller.  Wish the bottom did not flare out as much as it does but I like it.
4.0,"I really liked the wigs/cape portion, but the mask was TERRIBLE. I don’t know who’s face or eyes were meant to fit in that haha but not mine! I would have had to squint, and it was even over my eyelashes"
4.0,For the price you won't find anything quite so simple and elegant looking.  Small but with enough weight to notice it's still there and a clasp that is easy but won't fall off from normal daily use.  Great for men without looking too small of effeminate.
4.0,We love it shes 4 years old and we ordered size 4-6 & it fit fine a little loose but not a problem we ordered it for dance class would recommend only bad thing is the stars started falling even before she wore it so id say hand wash only other then that its sooo CUTE<br />(Sorry blurry pic)
4.0,Love this dress. I just recently had a baby and was hesitant about ordering my pre-pregnancy size because of my little after baby pouch. I ordered a size 10 and it fits perfectly!! I will be ordering other colors as well. It feels so comfortable!!
4.0,Great look and size. -1 star because wire is very flexible making putting on and taking off challenging.
4.0,Very cute. Isn’t really awesome material. But it will do for playtime.
4.0,"Its a great dress, the quality its not great but it looks like that the dress could hold for a couple years,  I'm giving it 4 stars because i'm usually a  large, but this dress aparently fit well but at the moment of tying it it looked weird because the front layers were to big so i needed to size down."
4.0,I bought the intermediate for my daughter. She's 6 and petite. Fit her well and the material felt nice because she's particular about how things feel.
4.0,"Get lots of compliments on these. Although they are cheap material, I'm glad I got temp. A little bigger than I thought tho. Nonetheless. Cute."
4.0,"Look. It was a gag. I put it on top of my hardhart, because everything is an emergency these days in construction. In that it was great and exactly what I expected. Just look out for the delivery costs. That was my bad for not checking."
4.0,"Very nice glasses. these are polarized and while I never really pay that much attention to that when I buy glasses, I really like these. I can see great with theses all day. Very comfortable. These are little smaller in whole then they look in photo. My husband says I like &quot;bug eyed&quot; glasses. These are smaller but cover my eyes great. No small cracks that shin random light like smaller glasses I've used. These came with  nice carry bag. Cute design. With some other glasses that have anything on the sides, it will pull on my hair, the little cracks just yank it out. These have not grabbed my hair and the parts between the design are close and don't leave much space to get things stuck in there. I love suns glasses. These protect my eyes and look great at the same time. Already gotten several compliments. I received this product at a discounted rate for my honest review."
4.0,"Fits good, quality material, great performance at my soccer game. Nice packaging presentation."
4.0,gave for kids valentines class but they were a little big for them. but it still look cute. green was a neutral color so everyone got the same thing and was happy
4.0,"Got mine today, they’re perfect, but I didnt get the stick :("
4.0,Am pleased they fit so well.
4.0,"Cute little elephant, it was a lot smaller than expected."
4.0,A bit difficult to get to stick to where I want on my ear but I love the design otherwise :)
4.0,Great jacket overall. I wish I would have just ordered my normal size instead of listening to advice on sizing up 1size.
4.0,Very soft. Awesome and vibrant graphic design. Fits true to size.
4.0,I really like the sweatpants feel of this being shorts. I do wish it were a bit more above the knee though.
4.0,"So first off. You’re gonna have to order 2-3 sizes up. I’m 5’8” and a size 16-18 with 48” hips. (These hips don’t lie lol) i normally wear an XL. I ordered a 4xl here and honestly coulda done a 5x. G- string was a joke, as expected. Fishnets were great. And I was pleasantly surprised by the gloves. Having chubby arms I wasn’t expecting them to fit but they do!"
4.0,This necklace is pretty but I had to buy extensions to be as long as it says it is. It is only 28 inches.
4.0,It’s a gift for our 11 yo granddaughter.  I opened and looked at everything.  I think she’ll like it all.  It’s just what she asked for and all looks to be decent quality.  We’ll find out more when we it’s opened and put into use on December 29.
4.0,I am a 34 DD and i was spilling out of the top pretty bad. Good quality for someone with smaller boobs.
4.0,It's really cute.  The leather is quite stiff and it's a little heavy but it looks sharp.
4.0,"Love this bracelet, I  feel  so much better  when  I  wear it."
4.0,"Good pricing, comfortable"
4.0,brilliant blue. very nice
4.0,Love the dress. It is light weight enough for sumner but still provides a professional and polished look.
4.0,"Make sure you buy the pole, too. :/"
4.0,Super cute sunglasses; unfortunately much too large for my two year old :(
4.0,sizing is a little off
4.0,It looks great and it's XXXL. I just better make sure not to throw it in the dryer and it'll be perfect.
4.0,"I loved the style of this swimsuit.  It has good coverage even in the front but is still a little sexy and flattering.  I only gave it 4 stars because the lining is in front only and is rather thin not providing much tummy support.  I may have been able to wear a medium instead of a large and felt more supported. I'm 5'2"" 147lbs."
4.0,Comfortable but not that easy to swap out.
4.0,"I love this thing!! It has one minor annoyance, but has a ton of room and holds a ton of weight. I am in college and have a lot of binders, notebooks, and textbooks to carry. I bought this product because of the size and, obviously, because it’s on rollers. This backpack has a LOT of space, for my laptop and all the other stuff I mentioned above. It’s got adequate little pockets and compartments, and a couple of really roomy side pockets (I use them for laptop cords, a mouse, two pairs of headphones and other things, with room to spare. Did I say it can also hold a ton of weight?<br /><br />The only down side to this product is that it needs a wider wheel base. It doesn’t take turning very well, especially turning+transitions. As long as you are going generally straight, it’s a solid ride. Turns are moderately ok, but even the smallest uneven transition or transition while turning causes the back pack to roll off wheels and turn on its side. However, because of its design, it’s very easy to get it back on track. The overturning frequency is more annoying than problematic.<br /><br />Lastly, the handle feels a little flimsy for the size of the backpack, but have not had any problems with the handle and have even lifted the full weight of my stuff in it with the extended handle and it holds the weight.<br /><br />To the manufacturers I would say that if it is your goal to keep it compact enough to be on an airplane, then put in some kind of collapsible extension bar attached to the wheels so they can be extended for a wider base while rolling, and can be collapsed for storage.<br /><br />I still love this thing. I hope this review helps you!"
4.0,"Very roomy in the toe box.  I wear a 6.5 and bought a 39, not sure if I should have bought a 38 but they work for me, I was concerned 38 might have been too small since I have a high instep.  They're cute and I appreciate the little vents in the bottom - I felt like my feet stayed a little cooler in spin class.  Very easy to install cleats (purchased separately)."
4.0,So cute! I did have to sceape up the bottoms a little bit on the concrete on my front porch though becasue my girl was slipping and sliding on out hardwood floor. other than that they are lovely!
4.0,I purchased this umbrella because I have lupus and the sun does horrible damage.  I have only had to opportunity to use once but it worked fine.
4.0,Like very much that they are adjustable!
4.0,"For the price it's hard to find anything negative to say about this.  It's flexible, comfortable, easy to adjust, comes with a spring bar tool and looks really good.  The only negative is I wish the spring bars were thicker/fatter.  They flop around a little inside the ends of the bracelet."
4.0,"The jacket seems well made.  The color is vibrant.  Fits as expected, sleeves are not too short.  Squashes down small to carry in a small space.  The fabric is similar to Gore-Tex, with the rubbery coating inside.  Waterproof zippers.  It would be nice if it had a mesh liner in the arms to keep that coating off your arms, but that would add bulk to an item that needs a small pack size."
4.0,Fits very well thanks to the adjustable ear loops.
4.0,"Great little gifts! The packaging was a little dinged up and the necklaces didn't all allign well with the gem doodle, but all around very cute!"
4.0,These were pretty close to perfect except one was an L-shaped and the others were nose bones (which is what I ordered/wanted). They are very cute and look like they cost much more than they actually did. I just wish all 4 were the same type.
4.0,"Fit Great and look great, Jersey type material. Drawstring is overly long."
4.0,Very cute ankle boots. The slits are open leather so these are versatile for a spring/fall shoe. High quality but just slightly larger than I expected. I wear a 6.5 in most boots and a 6 would have been better for me in these- but I will keep them and wear them!
4.0,It looked very loose compared to the picture.
4.0,"The flag was just beautiful, really. Sure, it's shiny, which can be a bit bad for pictures, but then again it's made of polyester so that is to be expected. However. The fabric ripped easily. I have no idea how I was able to rip the sleeve part on one side so easily, but i did. Of course, it's easy to saw shut again, but it was outside the stitching so it doesn't have anything to do with the way it's sewn. It's simply the fabric being a bit more fragile than expected. Still a great flag and i'm excited to use it for pride (^-^)"
4.0,Just a little too big.  But I love it.
4.0,Order up at least one size.Quality item just small and long.
4.0,Very pretty pattern just fits smaller than expected.
4.0,Like fabric. Wish it was shorter.
4.0,"Fits great, I like it since it long enough that is pa pgreat summer dress and is appropriate for my age."
4.0,"These are cute wool socks. They are warm but not overly thick which means I can still wear them with a variety of footwear. They fit in boots or sneakers. I am a women's size 8 and these fit my feet perfectly. What I really like is the length of them. They are somewhere in between ankle socks and crew socks which makes them great to wear with low cut boots. I actually like the way they look peeking out over the boot, almost looks like a boot liner. The height is perfect for me as I usually don't like crew socks because they have a tendency to fall down. The shorter style of these doesn't let them fall down and still keeps my feet warm in boots."
4.0,"I ordered two.  One for myself and one for a friend, as a way for us to be connected.  The pendant was a little thinner and more lightweight than I anticipated. But still very pretty."
4.0,The medium was a bit tight. Returned for a large and fits great. Love the color and hood.
4.0,Had to return and order a size larger
4.0,Great slippers to wear around the house on cold hard wood/ tile  floors.
4.0,Very nice and looks just like photo.
4.0,I like the fabric.  It is light and breezy.  Also I like the flap in the back and also the large brim really covers a large portion of your face.
4.0,"I am a photographer and was on a mission for airy summer dresses I could should a 10 hour day in.  I took a gamble on this gem.  I really loved the design--the over layer is a type of mesh sheen with flowers embroidered on it and the bottom layer is a black knee-high sheath dress.  For reference-- I am 6' tall, 188 lbs, 38DD chest.<br />The quality was really good on the fabric, BUT I will be returning this simply because it was about 4 inches too short.  It's hard to see in the pics, but it rose up above my ankles about 3 inches and made it look awkward on me, unfortunately.  I'd say if you're about 5'9 or under, this would be super cute on you!"
4.0,"color was too light, i was hoping for a dsaker brown, color is more of a bleached out brown"
4.0,"NO complaints, I like this shirt; it is just a Tshirt, but it's nice to have a 'uniform' that didn't cost an arm and a leg. Add your own black pants and you feel like a member of Star Fleet."
4.0,"I love the mesh detailing or overlay on this sports bra. It fit true to size and feels supportive for light workouts like Pilates or yoga, but obviously since it doesn't have any cups or structure, it is not supportive enough for aerobics.<br /><br />I love the fashionable design of this, how it has basically a synthetic underlayer with the mesh over the top and how the mesh straps add a second layer of light support.<br /><br />What I don't love about this is the quality level. The elastic band is just that, straight up elastic with itchy threads holding it together, I don't know why this brand persists in putting its name all over everything as though it is Lululemon, and the mesh is a little bit less soft and luxurious than I would personally prefer. The whole thing just feels like it was designed by someone awesome in the US but then made in China without a whole lot of oversight as to the materials.<br /><br />Overall it comes together well and is a bra that I will be happy to use and wear, but given how cool the designs are, I would love it if they would pay little more attention to their material and construction quality."
4.0,Love tjis dress but needed a bigger size
4.0,wash and wear great dress.
4.0,"This is an incredibly sexy swimsuit. It covers what it should, but with the straps going every which way, it lends a very sexy feel to it. If you need to hide any body flaws, this isn't the suit for you. It has a Brazilian cut back, so your butt cheeks are somewhat exposed. The top has absolutely no support for your breasts, so a busty woman would be uncomfortable in this. The fabric is very nice and the suit machine washed nicely. I hung it to dry, which was quick, and it looks as good as new. It's definitely an orange color, it's not red. Overall, it's a nice suit."
4.0,"Loved it, special since it was well made and not see thru.<br />Too bad it did not fit, ended up returning it. I'm 5'5/ 155lb for those wondering."
4.0,I wear them fairly often and they're nice enough.
4.0,Great glasses.  I'm taking them to get my prescription. I received  alot of  compliments
4.0,I simply loved it.
4.0,The top runs a little small.  Other wise a great sleep set.
4.0,I bought these boots for clubbing.  They are great.  The platform makes them not feel as steep a heel but definitely make you TALLER.  The zipper makes getting them on and off easy and the lace up front makes them sexy.
4.0,I just received this in the mail today! And.....I love it!! It looks exactly like the picture (heather Grey). The only reason I took a star off is because it smells strange. Like chemicals of some sort. Hopefully it will wear off soon.
4.0,"This is a Great shirt. Loved the color, the length and the sleeves. It was Just more fitted than I wanted."
4.0,Making bracelets in honor of my mother. She lived 17 years with Alzheimers
4.0,I thought the M would be inlayed with the buckle and not sticking out so that's my only complaint but I still like it and plan to wear it for a while so far it holds up well
4.0,"Es muy bonita, pero no apropiada para un pie ancho."
4.0,She loves the material but I did have to go a size bigger didn’t feel it was true to size
4.0,Beautiful dress but runs a little small. I'll be sending it back for a size bigger cuz I love it
4.0,He likes it so far but it’s a lot smaller than I thought it would be. But it’s a good started watch for a 13 year old
4.0,"Per the reviews I ordered this suite 2 sizes up and it fit great length wise. I'm 5'3', 135 and this suite looks great on me."
4.0,"Fits nicely and scrunchie is a nice add, but even a coach told my daughter she looked hot in the velvet. Will be better in the winter"
4.0,Watch info says leather band. Product info says synthetic leather. With this in mind I wonder if the gold is plated or layered? Is it plated directly on stainless or does it have some flaky copper stuff upon which the gold is plated thereby turning my wrist green?<br />At first I trusted Amazon. But may the buyer beware. Also be prepared to wait a month while the Chinese make your watch (info says German technology. Which is deceptive even if the Chinese use German machines.) I could go on but the 2 rules below sum it up. To which I add if YOU know your products don't expect your secretary who doesn't to type it up and get it right.
4.0,"I wouldn't call these &#34;compression&#34; pants. They are comfortable and not nearly as tight or thick as true compression workout pants. Still, good quality for the price."
4.0,"These are nice but are not well soldered.  Several of them had sharp steel wires sticking out on the ends, and I .... drew blood.  Be aware as your work with them.  I put take and/or shrink wrap on the ones with sharp points."
4.0,"Pants are great, belt loop broke the first time my daughter put on her pants.  I can fix this easily though.  I would buy them again."
4.0,They were great for my two nights of Halloween parties but they got dirty very quickly and I haven’t been able to get them as perfectly clean as they were. So..don’t expect these to be long lasting. But they definitely work for a costume!
4.0,"have ordered three of these so far. first was intended as gift but liked it so much I kept it and ordered another  a bit flimsy and you have to be careful about snagging it, but for the price it's great.  just wish the shipping wouldn't take so long."
4.0,"The onesie fit as expected but the overall skirt, the straps were way too big (reason for 4/5).  We made it work though and it was suuuuper cute for Valentine’s Day. Everyone loved it!"
4.0,These were crazy comfy but they looked like old lady shoes and I just couldn’t do it.
4.0,i really like these boots people always look down at the design and they keep her feet warm
4.0,"6'1&#34; 195 lbs, ordered XXXL and good for length but narrow in the shoulders. Belt on back was too high so had tailor remove it, she was surprised about the price and said the material is good. Would buy again."
4.0,🥳
4.0,"Nice, comfortable and handsome pair, at a well reasonable price!"
4.0,Beautiful dress. Very comfortable. The fabric doesn’t feel cheap it actually feels well made.
4.0,I was searching for slouchy beanies and found these. They are nice but kind of stiff even after a few washes and don't really slouch the same way as shown in the photos. But I still like these and always keep one in my tote for unexpected chilly nights.
4.0,"This kurta has a lovely color, is really decent and very comfortable!<br />I ordered a size 36 because product description mentions for Chest/Bust size 36in.<br />But it was really tight, especially chest and waist. I am definitely returning it and since the next size isn't currently available, I'll just have to wait I guess.<br />I would definitely recommend this kurta."
4.0,"These are nice. They look cheap up close, but if it isnt 1 inch away from your face, you cant even tell it is cheap."
4.0,Perfect and works amazing although it came a little scratched on the lenses but color and everything is good
4.0,"I love mid length shorts like these with the handy phone pocket.  This pair is not the best example I've ever owned - they're not bad, but they have a very specific issue, which is the waistband.  The over all fabric isn't as compressing or as elastic as many others out there, and so they had to add a thin strip of elastic at the waist instead of just making the waist fit snugly.  This means that they don't really compress your stomach area, and you can VERY MUCH feel the elastic against your waist.  I suspect that this will impact how they wash and how long they last as well."
4.0,Really like this and it arrived quickly and fit just right.
4.0,"It's a beautiful necklace, the only problem I have is the pendant is smaller than I expected. Still a beautiful piece and I wear it everyday."
4.0,gold finish comes off easily but its a very durable product which ive relied on for years
4.0,nice looking hands thanks
4.0,"I purchased these for my husband, who is an avid hunter for his birthday.  The boots fit the length of his foot perfect, however the width is a little narrow.  Once he gets them broken in, I am sure he will wear them for years until they are worn out, just like the last pair."
4.0,Love that they stay on during Pilates
4.0,"Super comfy, attractive dress. I like where it fell for a little more modest look- just below my knees. I am 5’3” and 125 and ordered a small. It was just a tad big in the waist, but still super comfy and I will be buying more in other patterns."
4.0,"These look really smart and are really comfortable for longer wear. They are pull-on, though, which I didn't realize when I bought them. The fit is such that my toes get mushed into the toe of any socks I'm wearing. I've taken to just wearing them without socks."
4.0,"A little more snug than expected, but overall just absolutely gorgeous! It was perfect!"
4.0,Super cute shirt. Received a lot of compliments on it! But it runs a little small. I would size up 1 size.
4.0,Bathing suit is nice but the coverup is a joke it must be made for her Doll
4.0,Very cute but small was more of a medium size.
4.0,I wish they screwed a bit tighter to the lobe
4.0,Bought these as a gift for my niece. She loved them. They fit like a glove which is what she likes. Nice bright colors and made of durable material.
4.0,"Bought this shirt for my brother for Christmas, ended up having to exchange it as the Large didn't even fit me and I'm smaller than he is. XL was a good fit for him and me both."
4.0,"These pants are so fabulous! I got the green in a size large (I’m 5’7, 160lbs, with a curvy bottom half). They are super flattering and great for work! The only reason I didn’t give 5 stars is because I haven’t washed them yet and some reviews said there were issues post-washing."
4.0,"It is very cute. I ordered the pink one and the color looks like the picture. However, like some reviews have mentioned, the pockets are deep and if you put your cards in, it would be a bit challenging to take them out."
4.0,"I've bought 2 pairs of these so far in black and grey. After living in jeans the majority of my life I found these to be extra comfy.<br /><br />They are thin so not conducive to prolonged outdoor winter wear, but not so thin that they are see through.<br /><br />My only complaint is that the tie string is too short and pulled out the first washing. I tied a knot in each end to prevent that from happening again.<br /><br />Over all great pants and I'll probably be buying more of them."
4.0,"I like that I can cover my fob. The only thing I guess, is I wish it was more roomer. Seems tight, and I guess I’d like knowing no buttons will get pushed."
4.0,"I originally bought this watch because the company I worked for at the time, timed breaks down to the second.  If you were so much as a second late, you would be written up and given a warning.<br /><br />It's a great little watch that is packed with useful features, I find the alarm function particularly useful as it has a very distinct pitch which is difficult to sleep through.  The AM/PM marker is important to note though, as I have to cycle through 12 hour markers to change the alarm.  The day and date feature is another great one to have, as it saves the guess work of remembering what day of the week and date of the month I am currently on.  This comes especially in handy when filling out and completing paperwork.<br /><br />The band is very comfortable to wear, my only recommendation is an occasional cleaning as it has a tendency to accumulate residue from dead skin and sweat, which can lead to an uncomfortable rash if not otherwise addressed."
4.0,Nice mask but it has a terrible smell. Smells like rancid plastic. Sat it outside on the balcony for 2 days and it got better but it's still pretty strong.
4.0,Enjoying these pretty sunglasses!
4.0,"This is super cute. I ordered based off my height.. I’m 5’5.. I guess considered heavy set and it fits good.. I feel like there should be more buttons in the front to keep it from opening in between the buttons. Also, sometimes when I sit down the zipper in the back will come unzipped. Which is kind of annoying."
4.0,"Nice item, but of the two I ordered, one them had a very noticeable blemish on the logo side. As these are key rings for an expensive vehicle, I was just a bit let down, but not enough to return them."
4.0,"Very nice dress, soft knit fabric. Runs a little small."
4.0,I love the skirt but I hate the way it was sewn. The pictures attached is how it looked when I took it out of the bag. I wish it was better made but I guess this is what is expected when you pay $15 bucks for a skirt.
4.0,"Nice leaf earings.........but no back post, just little rubber stoppers - that's why the backs aren't shown in the pictures. Would have been a 5 star otherwise."
4.0,"This is a beautiful little watch that has a little weight to it.  Not light and plastic (which I half expected due to the price.)  I gave 4 stars because the glass came all smudged and dirty.  :(  It arrived in a nice little box with a bow.  Because this was shipped China Post and the delivery was estimated for 4-6 weeks out from order BUT it arrived after only 2 weeks.  We have only had it for a few weeks and my husband mostly keeps it away for formal occasions so there's no way to tell the durability and longevity of this watch yet.  However, it is a nice looking watch for the price."
4.0,"The fabric is comfortable enough that I can wear it all day, while the stretchiness means it will fit whether I am slim or chubbing it up.<br />My only complaint is the color.  Its more of a muddy green then a forest green, which is what I ordered.  Oh well.  4 stars."
4.0,"Testing this as a free product from the Amazon Vine program.<br />I like to find out about a product when I've never heard of the name before, and Lumberfield as it turns out is part of the Jiangsu Beaume Outdoor Products Co., Ltd., so made in China.<br />That's not a complaint, and the parent company has been going since 1996 and has a multi million dollar yearly turnover.<br />First problem however is sizing, this as tested was a ""L"" but as it's own description says (in the small print)"" size is smaller than U.S. Size to shape your body"" Which means this is supposed to be around a 44"" chest but may feel a little snug.<br />Other than that, it's a nice blend of cotton, polyester and spandex so plenty of stretch.<br />Feels nice and warm, probably not warm enough for Minnesota winters, but good as a layer.<br />Overall I rated it 4 stars, I think it's reasonable value for money, especially when compared with brands like North Face, and Patagonia, and good build quality. Wash cold, and line dry, I wouldn't recommend tumble drying."
4.0,"very light glasses, cheap construction, but good for the money"
4.0,Runs small. Really cute suit. Seen it for slot more at Venus
4.0,"I wish I wouldn't have gotten so freaked out about the reviews of it fitting too small. I ordered large like what the reviews told me to, but it ended up being too large. Went to Germany (and the actual Oktoberfest) wearing this and the drindel is supposed to be hella tight."
4.0,I still wear this dress to church. Its very cute but shrinks
4.0,"Fit as expected.  I read the top was massive and the shorts were small... all being true.  I don't mind the bagginess of the top since I'm sporting this ensemble at home; and the shorts have an elastic waistband for some give.  I like the thickness of the band and love the pockets!  It's 95% poly and 5% spandex.  Dislike:  I ordered orange.  The print is nothing like what is pictured, though I didn't expect it to be exact given it's tie dye.  There's no orange in the print at all.  They're pink and blue, like cotton candy."
4.0,"Just was described a band with the shema, good quality...."
4.0,"My stone is almost-clear - which I am starting to like...  But, I expected a darker green stone.<br /><br />The necklace is VERY fine (and tangles easily).  I switched out the chain.<br />But..., the chain works for another of my necklaces (so I'm glad to have it regardless)."
4.0,Received the jumpsuit super quick. Material is light weight but durable. It'll work perfect for my April O'Niel (from TMNT) costume. Thank you! (Did not come with belt. I added that for the costume.
4.0,Cheaper quality but I think they look better in person than the pictures. I wasn’t overly impressed with them.
4.0,They look great with the necklaces I will be selling
4.0,Bought it for my son and he loves it.  It is a quality piece. Dropped it to 4 stars because delivery was late.
4.0,It’s fine . The color is beautiful. Amazing for summer time .
4.0,I love the X-Files and this so reminds me of Fox Mulder's poster in his basement office.<br />The shirt is very comfortable and fit as expected (medium).<br />I did wash it before I wore it and the wicking makes it dry pretty easily. The shirt didn't seem to shrink. It is not as smooth looking as the picture on the Amazon page.
4.0,I like the top a lot.However it was too large for me.. want to return it and get a smaller size.
4.0,"Great movement, very stretchy, and the slight poof in the shoulder is cute/trendy. The waist line sits a bit high for me, but I have a slightly larger bust; so it might sit lower on someone with less of a cup size. Other than that, totally worth the price!<br />I’m 5’8”, 160lbs, 36D, and muscular."
4.0,Beautiful but a little small.. makes great gifts for the granddaughters
4.0,"Very comfy - they fit well, and I was worried because I'm short and usually need petite sizes, but the medium pants are just slightly too long, which is fine.  The waistband elastic rolls a bit, but otherwise I'm very happy with these PJ's."
4.0,"Followed the reviews and ordered half size smaller, I usually use 6 and I ordered 5.5 and it fit great. Sole is kind of heavy though."
4.0,"Very cute dress but a little tight across the chest. I am 5’6, 36D and it was just a little too tight across the bust. Fit perfectly every where else! I’m sure I could have it altered, but I ordered other dresses and just chose another."
4.0,fiance likes them but just too big
4.0,Really happy with the watch well made and still ticking. Only issue is I'm unable to attach it to the bottom of my badge because the butterfly clip opens downward.
4.0,"A little stinky when it came out of the package, but after a quick wash it was perfectly fine ! For the price, it’s surprisingly adorable &lt;3 It’s jingly and cute !!"
4.0,Material threw me off but it still did the job
4.0,"Really like this, but it runs big. Order down 1-2 sizes!"
4.0,Like the hoodie part
4.0,Sweater runs small
4.0,"This hat is very soft and lightweight. It does not add a lot of warmth though. I've been using it under another hat that is heavier and a little itchy. I'd prefer a thicker, warmer beanie that I could wear on its own."
4.0,"Noice toite nups. Comfy, keeps time. Light is really bad though. Don't know if it was just mine, but the light barely works"
4.0,These are good quality metal frames and real glass lenses.  Though they don't improve your vision they are great for costumes and fitting in at craft beer bars.
4.0,Like ease of use.
4.0,"I loved the blouse. The only reason it didn't get a 5 star was because it took about 3 weeks to get here, didn't feel that was necessary. True to color, I would say a small large if you  understand. I normally wear a large, purchased a large just a tad small for a large but still fit great."
4.0,"Runs small, and not long in length as I expected."
4.0,"Gave 4 instead of 5 stars because I love the feel of the fabric,they're cute, and fit good but the pink ones got a hole in the leg the first time I put them on, but I'm just gonna sew it"
4.0,"Very nice watch for the money.  Easy to read. The simple, casual style goes with a lot different clothing."
4.0,Good quality. Take 2 sizes bigger
4.0,Very delicate. But nice quality.
4.0,"Certainly not designed for comfort, but very stylish and sturdy. I'm a 6' male and there's no way this was going to fit me. Great for the smaller frame types!"
4.0,Be careful with the sizing.  It is a bit strange.  Please make sure that you are looking at the US size.
4.0,I got these for my teenage daughter they are a little big around her head. They don't stay over her nose very securely. I tried it on it fit much better. It is definitely sized for an adult head.
4.0,"I LOVE these. I wear them nearly every day. Fits as expected I got a medium and they fit great. (I normally wear medium) great for exercise, yoga , lounging around and every day wear!"
4.0,they really do the job
4.0,a bit small for a 2 year old. Still adorable.
4.0,Great hats for little girls and for the price.  The elastic cord doesn't work well.  We just removed that and it was fine.  They probably won't last forever but they are great for a tea party and dress up.
4.0,Nice gold belt I'm going to use in making a roman era costume and it would be great to wear when I go dancing too! I have a 34 inch waist and it even sat on my hips on the last hooks.
4.0,Only reason I give it 4 stars is deliver was super slow.
4.0,"The dress is cute and the fit is fine.  I'm 5'2"" 130lb. The material is pretty thin and see through,  but I expected that at the price and it being a white dress."
4.0,Beautiful and love.
4.0,I LOVE this dress. I received so many compliments on it when I wore it for a wedding this spring. I sized up- usually size 6/8 so I ordered a large and it was perfect.  I wore a slip under the dress as it was a pretty windy day.
4.0,Great set.  Colors are great.  Backs are very long.
4.0,Runs a little small. Very thin denim
4.0,The jacket is really warm even when it is not heated!  The jacket runs small around the mid waist.  I contacted the company and they got back to me right away! and provided an alternative. Awesome customer service
4.0,"Comfortable cotton, nice fit."
4.0,"beautiful style bathing suit. looks good on, I wear size 16 clothes. Ordered 5x (US16-18). Unfortunately I had to return it due to Cup fitting too Large.<br />Appears to be a D cup where I am a B cup. I loved this suit and was disappointing I had to return it."
4.0,"I bought this as a gift and my fiancé loved it! I won't fault it, it looks elegant and doesn't tell much about the price.. Which is great!"
4.0,"Nice, soft material, exactly as advertised.  Stitching appears solid."
4.0,"Good color, not quite as durable as my original band but have not had any issues with this item. I think I will probably get it in a few more colors!"
4.0,Very comfy and stretchy but ordered a size or two larger and still was snug in the boob area
4.0,"I had no idea how short the dress would be.  I purchased a larger size and naturally expected it to be lower on the leg (longer torso, etc) but it was a couple of inches above my knee.  The pattern is very cute, however I would recommend using a half-slip or full-slip as the material is very thin.  I probably would dry clean it too."
4.0,"It is super comfy, and the waist fits perfectly.  It's a great denim, not stiff, very soft.  I do think it is a little long, and I am going to hem mine, but, I would buy it again!"
4.0,This is a nice lightweight scarf with a really pretty design!
4.0,Extra large was almst a 2 x
4.0,The pants are long and wide and look big and baggy.
4.0,"Nice earrings,  Not as full as they seem."
4.0,"Very nice piece. I thought &#34;ox&#34; would be much smaller than pictured, but I like the way it hangs around my neck."
4.0,Wish they had kids sizes but love the shirts
4.0,Love Clemson.  Go tigers
4.0,"Looks Great, very nice looking"
4.0,"The camouflage shirt is as pictured with the faded army green, grey, and black colors. The shorts are not included in the order. I had to read the description carefully to figure that one out. The shirt is pretty thin and light weight. The material is just ok. It’s not as soft as I had imagined."
4.0,"Despite being an XL, this fits like a large or large medium. The hem stops at my waist instead of at the hip as shown in the picture If this were a regular tank top, I would say the sizing is definitely too small. However, I've noticed that lingerie sizes tend to be kind of small so perhaps other shoppers won't be as mixed up as I was.<br /><br />Aside from the sizing, I have no complaints. The color is a lovely turquoise and the silk jersey smooth and generous with the thread count. It's good quality."
4.0,You can wrap it twice around your wrist and sparkles a lot ! It looks like you are wearing lots of bracelets!
4.0,Dress fits amazing looks exactly like the picture… material and all… the only thing is the zipper is the small zipper so it’s hard to zip it up.. I had to leave it zip and take it over my head…
4.0,Great bracelet for the price. Just hope the single strand they run through the beads last as long as the leather braided part & the magnetic clasp. Otherwise a great purchase.
4.0,"I am 5'6"" I bought a large and it does shrink a little not much though. But its perfect my weight is about 142 lbs. Very soft thin and nice I love it"
4.0,"I purchased this bra to wear with a low cut dress in the front and back. With the advisement of other reviewers, I sized up in my band size (I am typically a 34C, and I purchased a 36B). It fits fit and as expected. Unfortunately, with how the dress it cut, the bra still peeks out in both the front and the back. I will keep this, as I'm sure I'll be able to wear it with other items of clothing."
4.0,"I gave up on traditional wallets and bill folds after college and decided that a front-pocket money clip must exist that could hold everything I need without causing an embarrassing or uncomfortable bulge. Since that fateful day, I've been on a quest to find the perfect wallet (more on my criteria for perfect later) and have purchased or received as a gift at least 10 wallets in the last 10 years (that's right, about 1 per year). When I came across the Storus wallets in the catalog, I tore out the page in question and vowed to investigate further when I was in front of a computer.<br /><br />I was pleased to find that the entire Storus line is offered on Amazon.com and at a lower price point than those listed in the Sky Mall catalog. After comparing the [[ASIN:B002L8FFWM Smart Money Clip Leather (Cognac Brown)]] to the stainless steel version ([[ASIN:B001RMO3NK Storus Smart Money Clip - Polished Stainless Steel]]), I decided to stick with the leather and made the purchase.<br /><br />My criteria for the perfect wallet are listed below and I've indicated how the Storus wallet performs on each.<br /><br /> - Stylish yet durable: The Storus wallet is attractive enough and the leather seems like it will last for quite some time.<br /><br /> - Sufficient storage for at least 6 credit cards and/or ID: The Storus wallet includes a single pouch for card storage. However, it easily hold my driver's license, two credit cards, my debit card, 3 health insurance cards and my auto insurance card. For those of you keeping count, that's 8 cards.<br /><br /> - Effective money clip: The Storus wallet employs a simple stainless steel clip into which you slide your folded bills. The clip is very snug (which may take a little getting used to) but the bills are held firmly - even a single, folded bill. I'm not a high roller but I've successfully stuffed about 30 folded bills into the clip without issue. If wads of cash aren't your thing (I'm a plastic kind of guy) then the clip will also hold a few credit cards without issue or damage to the cards. I sometimes keep a few business cards behind the cash.<br /><br /> - Comfortable to carry: Even stuffed with 8 cards and a wad of cash, the Storus Money Clip is less than 1"" thick. It sits comfortably in my front pocket without issue or unsightly bulge.<br /><br />To make a long story short (ok, slightly longer), the Storus Smart Money Clip just might be the perfect wallet.  It's certainly the best I've found thus far."
4.0,"It is very comfy. I like the design, got here faster than expected."
4.0,Really like the print...went perfect for Holiday Spirit Week.
4.0,Looks great & very comfortable.  Burgundy is nice color!
4.0,I love all of it except I have a flip phone and it is the only thing that fits in the front snap section.  If you have a smart phone it would be perfect.
4.0,"So sexy! My husband loves it and so do I! Better than pushup bra I've ever purchased. It even came with an additional strap for back so you could add another 2 inches..increasing a 36 to a 38.<br /><br />The only problem is the shoulder straps are to small. Fortunately they can be taken off and replaced with other straps; but I've yet to find a color remotely similar. so I find it to be a little less sexy with mix match straps. But fully clothed, watch out ladies! You will be one hot mama!"
4.0,"Limited sizing ability, either to tight or too loose no mid size links"
4.0,The top again didn't fit the bottoms and fit my 38D's in the cups.
4.0,I don't regret it
4.0,"Band is extremely stiff, no built in light, day feature hard to set and keep set."
4.0,"They start out snug, but will stretch. I really like this slipper."
4.0,"The item was good, they fex and bowtie don't match but I just needed the fex so it was no big deal"
4.0,"They say unisex but they really don't fit a woman's head. Frames were too large, gave them to my boyfriend and they fit him perfectly."
4.0,No instructions how to use quick deployment buckle
4.0,excellent product! the company has found an attachment to the eyeglasses that works effectivelyI am 84 and never found one yet.
4.0,A little heavy for Nevada residents HOT!
4.0,"They are fine, nice colors comfortable, only negative is , the material is really thin. I am not expecting to last long . Haven't washed it yet."
4.0,"easy to setup and use, it is not so sensitive as the original one in a ""relative long"" distance, but it works well when close to the garage door, although the price is only 1/3 or less."
4.0,I liked the color but the pants fall down when I’m doing a workout
4.0,material is soft.  good shirt.  husband was pleased.
4.0,"I was very surprised at how well this shirt fit, snug around the arms and chest. I'm very pleased, but we shall see how well it holds ups after various washes. The shirt feels a little more synthetic and heavy  than I was hoping, but nothing to really complain about."
4.0,I like that they has side pockets to carry everything. And they're comfortable
4.0,"i love the idea of this but it needs to be just a bit bigger to actually fit two pairs (my sunglasses and reading glasses). still keeping it though - and best part , it matches my V.B. bag!"
4.0,"Very cute shirt, came folded neatly in a water proof bag. My daughter loved it."
4.0,"Wow!<br /><br />This is the start of my love affair with bandage dress. Purchased the blue one only to find that I feel like I need one in every colors.<br /><br />I am 5’8”, around 165 lbs, purchased the medium size.<br /><br />It fits beautifully. A little complain is underneath the breast area it seems like it’s loose but it doesn’t bother me at all.<br /><br />I did wish it was a little longer, so I bought a black one from the same company that’s longer and the bottom part goes below the knees and it was also perfect!<br /><br />Overall happy with this company and their products.<br /><br />If you’re contemplating on buying this, buy them all 😜"
4.0,Shrunk when put in the dryer
4.0,"Comfortable, cheap, and warm sweatshirt. Exactly as I expected."
4.0,It’s great!<br />Will buy more
4.0,It's rated 4 stars because it is hard to get the clicker in place at times. But it is adorable and i have gotten many compliments on it.
4.0,These belts are great. You can wear them with jeans or even belt a dress and it looks really cute. The price is great for the quality of these belts. I would recommend these belts for everyone.
4.0,Good but not scratch resistant. Nice for swimming!
4.0,Gift for my daughter.  Her words “super cute”
4.0,I love this dragon cuff earring. The only back draw is that the cuff is mounted on the earring backwards so it doesn't hug the ear from front to back.
4.0,BOUGHT THIS TO GO WITH MK PURSE I PURCHASED FOR MY WIFE. SHE LOVES IT. NICE COLORS.  WELL CRAFTED. MY ONLY CRITICISM IS THAT PICTURE LOOKS MORE OF A YELLOW GOLD WHILE THE ACTUAL PRODUCT WHEN IT ARRIVED LOOKS MORE OF A ROSE GOLD.
4.0,So cute! I want to order more colors. They fit my 11 month old (around 19lbs) little girl really well and I know they will grow with her for sometime.
4.0,"Can be a little wobbly, otherwise, absolutely adorable and great functionality."
4.0,Yes the item did meet my expectation.
4.0,My impressions of this acrylic stand is upon opening I was a little confused as to the set up but my husband was able to help and get it set up in no time at all for me. The base of the stand comes across and a little wobbly but once put together is very sturdy and rotates with no problems at all. Make sure you pay close attention to assembly the rubber bands provided are used to maintain the stability of the stand and so certain pieces stay in place. The floating shelves within are easy to move around as needed the only thing I was kinda eh about was that if you were wanting to have them all on the same level you can't they have to be at different levels. The stand seems very well made and some parts are thicker then others. I hope you can gauge the overall size of it thru the pictures as it was a little bigger than expected and wish it was just a tad smaller but overall it looks very appealing and holds quite a good amount of things. I was able to have everything plus more that I normally have on the countertop. I overall like the idea of having this stand to store all of my everyday items on for day to day use and I haven't yet decided on using it for the additional makeup storage.
4.0,"It was cool for a costume, not something I would wear everyday."
4.0,Fabric is great! And soft and fits perfect.
4.0,"very good looking, light and looks like expesnsive one<br />they darken your vision  more  than i would like to."
4.0,"It's a great dress, but runs very large.  I ordered a large and will exchange it for a medium.  It's a jersey knit, very stretchy and comfortable."
4.0,Nice and simple very elegant watch.<br />I got it for my 13 years old son and it just look great!
4.0,I love all the compartments.just a little heavy when filed.
4.0,"I wanted a top that was long enough to cover my rear end, not to tight or clingy, and roomy enough for my chest.<br /><br />This shirt is everything I wanted but I won't be keeping it as the design is too extreme for my taste.<br /><br />Every element is a little bit overboard. Yes it's long but a little too long (and this is coming from a girl who is 5'9&#34; and has a long torso), the handkerchief hem comes to an extreme point and flares out at the hips so you need to really like that style, and finally the lace trim is pretty thick,  it is not a dainty subtly detail, it is very noticeable.<br /><br />This style may work for you, it did not for me. I like my tops to pull double duty and I could not imagine  wearing this with skirts and shorts as well as with my jeans.<br /><br />Pros: soft, thick material. Not sheer (even the white) Not clingy, and forgiving in the midsection<br /><br />For reference: I am 5'9&#34; I am 142 pounds, I have an athletic build, a long torso and a size 36DD chest. I ordered a medium and it was a bit long and loose around the hips (my hips are a size 4)<br /><br />Hope this was helpful"
4.0,every girl should have at least one! ;)
4.0,Looks nice and styleless
4.0,These work as excpected and delivered before expected.
4.0,"Great quality, great fit. True to size, very comfortable. Material is sturdy and not see-through."
4.0,Got these for my 7 yr old grandson.<br /><br />They are made well and look sharp. My only complaint is the pull string does not go around the elastic band so you don't have much change in trying to tighten them.
4.0,a little long a little loose but cute
4.0,comfy and funny
4.0,Bought it for a cruise- perfect
4.0,would have gave you 5 stars but need it to be just alittle bigger
4.0,"Fancy and cute, very comfortable"
4.0,"Light, comfortable and they seem durable."
4.0,Very pretty just flimsy
4.0,"I use this jumpsuit for aerial silks and other acrobatic workouts.  For the price, the quality is very good - especially on the pant part, which has good stretch/support and small mesh/sheer panel near the ankle.  For activities where you are tightly wrapped and/or upside down, the top part does not offer enough coverage.  I still need to wear a high-neck sports bra with this jumpsuit to keep body parts from falling out.  I am not particularly busty (b cup), but the top does not offer much coverage or support for anything upside-down.  The X-back is very comfortable and offers great range of movement for shoulders and arms.<br /><br />I bought size L, and I am 5'8&#34; and 165 lbs and muscular, a regular size 10 with broad shoulders.  The Large fits me well with room to spare, I could also probably wear a medium and have it be rather tight."
4.0,"I have thick hair and it actually stays on without being too tight. It is warm enough to wear and actually breathable. If it gets a little bit colder, I can throw in a disposable heat pad and it works great to keep the warmth."
4.0,Used for loungwear
4.0,"Nice gift , our brother is a welder and loves it."
4.0,"This watch yet my issue is that is super hard to rewind. My fingers hurt...<br />I wish it was a little smaller for a woman, that the hours/minutes were more visible (doesn't stand up, I have to look closely) and that it has the seconds marked.<br />It is adorable.<br />I've changed its band with a silver one (metal) because it was extra thick and rigid, very uncomfortable and I didn't like it.<br />So far is doing a great job"
4.0,Love the short but run small.
4.0,"Received it quickly. Cute, funny gift for a Hallmark movie lover"
4.0,Pretty good for the price. The blue &#34;stones&#34; stand out much better than their red equivalents.
4.0,"I wear an XL. These suits are sized a bit small so I had to order a XXXL to get close to an XL. The fit that is relatively close to a true XL.  I will explain..<br /><br />The jacket:  is large enough to allow a tshirt and outer shirt underneath, but across the chest seems to be smaller that a regular XL would fit. It doesn't bind or look goofy.. But I can tell that it is a bit smaller. I realized at that time that it is slightly tapered rather that straight cut, its a minor issue for me. However, if you have &#34;wings&#34; or wide lats like body builders and swimmers, the tapered fit may be a no go.  The sleeves, while they don't appear short, don't offer any extra length and are easily outreached in extended positions.  I think as little as an inch longer would have been great. Again, not a big issue for me.. However, If you have longer that average arms, I think this would be a definite no go.  The pockets are a bit weird.. The placement seems a bit low at just above the bottom hem but they are readily accessable. They are also a bit small with just enough room for your hand, but the greatest issue I have with the pockets is that they are not anchored to the jacket.  Anything you put in the pocket is immediately obvious as it pulls the pocket down past the hem making it easily visible.  Although I consider this a major design flaw, Its easily remedied with a little bit of monofilament (clear) thread, in a couple of strategic spots. The neck is a bit high for my taste, however it does flip down to form a collar, the issue with it at that point is that it is not &#34;finished&#34; on the inside. When flipped down, you see the inside stitching. One thing I have to point is the length. I love the length of this jacket. It comes down to just below the buttocks which helps with the slight snugness of the pants.<br /><br />The pants: fit.. the waist is pretty snug due to the very sturdy elastic that I suspect will help up a long time but could be a comfort issue with very active or extended wear.  The size is a little more fitting than a true XL but not tight. Like the jacket, the comparison to a true XL is pretty close.  The leg length and crotch clearance is good. Not too long and not too high. The pockets, like the jacket,  are a bit small and float inside the pants. That could cause the pocket to twist around,  making it hard to get access to keys or other device in an emergency. Another design flaw that is easily remedied with a little needle and thread.  The drawstring is a simple shoestring that is functional, but doesn't give much clearance past about 80% of the waist elastic. Meaning: If you open the waist to about 80%, the drawsting can slip through the hole and inside the hem, as it does not have sufficient length to comfortably open the waist to full capacity. I recommend tying the drawstring into a simple knot before trying them on.<br /><br />Conclusion: I like this suit. It has some flaws and a couple of fitment issues but for the price and the quality, even if they weren't easily fixed, I would still be very pleased with this purchase and will buy more."
4.0,I got for my 4 year old. She loves it and it's very cute on her.
4.0,Decent product would be nice if it was a little cheaper is a little baggy not bad I have  noticed  complaints from other people that it's padded which  it is  but they can easily be removed
4.0,"The quality is great. It feels nice good n the hand. The sheen and texture are pretty. It give that. 5⭐️ However, I’m disappointed at the over look of the pattern. It’s inconsistent all the way around. One side has tiny “scales” while the sides have larger scale patterns. The small scales looks weird. And the bottom has no pattern at all. It the pattern had been consistent I would rate higher. It give the look a 3⭐️. I am disappointed ☹️ and hesitant to order anther from this company even though I think their patterns are prettier than the other brands. I’ll update if I order another one."
4.0,"nice fit, easy to breath , a good buy"
4.0,Love the necklace just a way bigger stone than expected
4.0,"My brother loves his Christmas gift. It fit him, but the picture wasn’t a prominent white. It was faded."
4.0,"The dress itself was cute. Mine came with a run in the lace down the back near the zipper and so I had to return it, but otherwise the dress fit nicely and looked super cute on."
4.0,"This display box is made exceptionally well and the manufacturing is neat and clean.  The one complaint is that The paper used to protect the acrylic panes is difficult to remove, which will require a significant amount of peeling and careful rubbing to remove completely."
4.0,It’s not an under armor t-shirt feel but it feels good. However you always to have to take a bigger size than your regular size.
4.0,My.son loves the bag its sturdy
4.0,These are in my running shoes. I like the support and they have not broken down as quickly as the soles inside my running shoes would have.
4.0,Light weight. Material is a nice & easy flow.
4.0,Versatile....easy to use and store.<br />Great value for the price.
4.0,"I love this wallet, but some of the phrases are awkward.  I still like the wallet, just be aware that the sayings are poorly translated, but it kind of adds to its charm."
4.0,"My tween loved this! They wanted the matching flag but we haven't ordered it yet. The only small downside is that the mask is huge. Even their dad tried it on & it was big on him. We're making work, this is just an fyi. Overall it's great."
4.0,Really liked the metal attachments to the watch other bands have plastic and that's what kept breaking.  These  are really comfortable and the only thing is the red is more like a magenta.
4.0,Gave this to my niece.  She loves it.  Small for me so she wins.  I got the black and like the weight and softness of fabric.
4.0,They fit well and have good stretch. Good for casual wear and exercises.
4.0,"I am 132 pounds 5'3, it fit's me very well."
4.0,cute - I already broke the Tiara but as it was purchased to play dress up with the kids its all good - the earrings and necklace are stunning
4.0,This is cute.
4.0,Cute ...
4.0,"Es igual a la foto, me gusto"
4.0,Outstanding quality everything I was expecting!!!
4.0,Very pretty with a black dress.
4.0,"This dress was well-made, felt like a study material, and will fit someone who’s on the taller end. I’m 5’3” with a pear-shaped frame, and it wasn’t quite as flattering on me. The “strap” can be worn both on or off-shoulder, which is a nice twist."
4.0,"Nice looking shirt, but wrinkles very easily."
4.0,"I thought the red was too bright, but my 17 year old absolutely loves them!  The size was perfect."
4.0,it's very pretty
4.0,These Mickey Mouse stud earrings are really cute. They are made for pierced ears. They can be worn by any body of any age. I have two holes in each of my ears and I usually wear studs in the top hole. The stone in these earrings is a light blue. They are made of sterling silver. I like them a lot.
4.0,"The dress is beautiful, but it does run small, I usually wear a size 10, but this one is too small on the chest area, I waspito disappointed"
4.0,Purchased as a gift. She was happy and said they will complete her Halloween Costume.
4.0,"My husband easily misplaces his reading glasses.; he is an EMT/Fireman and has been in several emergency situations where he's laid them down and left them. We ordered these that come in a nice, sturdy case for each pair. The color matches with the case. While he's probably a bit less selective about &#34;matching&#34; than I would be at least he has the option."
4.0,Nice lounge wear. Does not look like picture
4.0,"A little on the thin side so definitely a spring or fall wear unless you wear maybe stockings under. & are form fitting in the waist, butt & thigh area then slightly baggie in the calf area. But workable"
4.0,"These socks are thicker than the ones sold at CVS.  They are great for compression.  You have to have a process to get these on since they are thicker than other brands.  It's easy. Get the toes and ball of the foot aligned correctly, then collect the bunch of sock and pull past the heel and up the calf.  If you get the right grip, it is a smooth process. Taking them off is sorta the reverse.  Slide them down the calf and slide your hand inside the sock and get the material past the heel.  The rest is easy."
4.0,I ordered one size larger and glad I did. Fits in a  size up. Good support. The double back clasp can be a tad difficult.
4.0,"Great dress overall, can be used for all occasion. Comfy"
4.0,They aren't meant to last long however they do last a good time if you don't use it too often. I would go size bigger to fit the entire chest.
4.0,"I bought a size 5-6T for my 4 and 1/2 little girl.  She is a little bigger for her age, but not huge, yet It is still too small.  Other than that, it is nicely made.  I just wish there was a better way to check size."
4.0,"Really cute watch band. I have in black, silver and gold. Very durable, easy to change size my removing links. Easy to take on and off my watch face. Definitely recommend if the smallest 18mm bands are too big for your wrist like they are mine."
4.0,This is a cute addition for St. Patrick’s Day. It appears the shamrock is hot glued on. Not sure that it’s going to last but it’s a costume accessory and I don’t need it for longer than that one day.
4.0,"The detail and coloring were excellent, and the visibility and comfort were good.  Unfortunately, the latex was deformed when packaged for mailing.  If there is a good procedure for returning the mask to its proper shape, then it should be included."
4.0,Was a little longer than I thought . Fit true to size and was as described.
4.0,"Great gift for my aunt who was turning 80.  She loves it!  I was originally sent a size other than the one I ordered, but the seller quickly sent out the right size without requiring me to send the wrong one back first.  That was great, because otherwise I would not have had it in time for the birthday. Thanks!"
4.0,"These rings fit true to size, the silicone is very very durable. I actually wear all three of these at the same time for fun, the only thing worth mentioning is that you can tell these have come out of a mold as the edges have a lip to them. Other than that, the silicon has a smooth finish to them. There's not really too much to say about these. Easy to slip on, durable, smooth, and they don't appear on your fingers as cheap. Not perfect, but nothing serious to really complain about.<br /><br />****** I received this product for free or at a discounted price.

4.0,"Beautiful bag, but it is brown, not gray as described."
4.0,"I'm a 5'4&#34; 170lb girl and I'm all hips and Butt . When I sit down the inseam pulls a bit like it's too tight but if you readjust yourself after you sit it's fine. I wear the waist band up on my stomach, almost under my boobs (so if you find that uncomfortable I wouldn't choose these) so that the crotch area isn't mid thigh (Short people problems). However beware that the chub rub will eventually wear the inseam and inner thigh material down making it much weaker so be careful with it and treat it like the fragile material it is. Overall it's super comfy and I love them a lot. I wash them in the washer with my other clothes and then hang them up to dry. They shrink too much if you put them in the dryer!"
4.0,Real nice. So much better than I expected
4.0,smaller than expected but worked fine for our cruise.
4.0,"Lovely dress: simple but elegant, and appropriate for professional settings. The light fabric and gorgeous teal color made it an instant favorite in my summer work wardrobe. I'm 5'9/130lbs and the small fits perfectly. My only complaint is that one of the metal bars on the waist tie bent and fell off the first time I washed it. I've gotten good wear from other PattyBoutik items, so I'm inclined to think I just received a defective product; however, I have yet to receive feedback from the company's customer service. If it weren't for that disappointing flaw, this would be a five-star item."
4.0,"Colorful socks, the material is a bit too thin though."
4.0,Love it! Easy to put on! Feels very secure. I read some reviews that it stays secure on during exercise. I’ll test that out tomorrow. Worth the purchase.
4.0,"The item arrived a couple of days sooner than expected. The quality of the hat is well made..no stitching undone or anytype of over stitched area. The color is vibrant and style is unique. Only wished they had my exact size, but the one I got is still good! Thanks!"
4.0,"for some reason, the ball would not screw on. I had to use another ball from another piercing. Even then, I still ended up losing the jewelry."
4.0,"Thin, balled up after second wear, seams do not match up where they should but with the inexpensive price they are still a 4 star because they are just to wear around the house!"
4.0,Fots as expected. Is never good. They should reword that question.
4.0,Size run  small.  Had to return them.  Nest time will know what size you will need.  cmsrobert
4.0,Nice though medallion is a big large for small wrists
4.0,Bought this in white and it is absolutely beautiful and delicate looking! Only issue is that it runs a little small.
4.0,Surprise the fit was short for my frame. Instead of wearing it to my waist I’ll wear it below like a hip hugger: it’s comfortable for lounging. The material isn’t Sherpa as I expected but it’s soft and easy to wear around the house. The color is soft and pretty
4.0,"Good hat. Warm, comfortable, not too big, not too small. What else is there to say?"
4.0,Loved the fit.  Wry comfy and it does dress up nice for work.  So comfy
4.0,I bought them for My daughter and She says they are abit not comfy .
4.0,The style is very cute but overall the dress was too big in the arm and waist for me. I ordered a size small and I am a size 4 in women's dresses.
4.0,It arrived on time and they look pretty.
4.0,"I bought these because I talk on the phone a lot at work so I wanted earrings that screw on and have a flat surface on the back. The post is a little thicker than I was expecting, and they hurt a bit for the first few days. I also have multiple piercings, and they are a little crowded wearing multiple pairs at once. However, I have been wearing these for a few months now and haven't taken them out. I make sure they're screwed in tightly every now and then, because one did fall out one time. I really the pattern, and get compliments on them somewhat frequently. I wouldn't buy this set again, but am glad I made the purchase."
4.0,Cute for what I wanted it for but size wasn't as expected
4.0,"Super cute dress, I would say order your exact size...I went up a size I got a XL instead of a L so it was slight bigger than expected but it wasn’t nothing a safety pin couldn’t fix! The accessories were all super cute!!!"
4.0,The pants waist was a small 34 and the jacket run larger than normal. The suit was very well made and good quality for the price. We are very pleased with that part. It measures up to the price we paid and my son wore it to the event anyway.
4.0,Just the color I wanted so far it has been really nice.  Looks great with great style seems durable.
4.0,"I modified it with velcro, for my newborn and it fit great. The metal piece has got some weight to it, so it needs to rest snug against the head. Without my modification, it would have fit my baby up to 4 months old."
4.0,"useful, fun and easy.  can be usd for layring"
4.0,"It was about 16 inches too long for my wife who 5'1"". But just hemed it up and she loves it."
4.0,I would give these 5 stars but they were shorter than I expected. Other than that they are perfect!
4.0,The shoulder parts looked good in the picture but didnt feel 100% comfortable with me.
4.0,"Ordered them for my daughter wedding, they looked great, only problem was a few of there clasp didn't want to close. But o am crafty so I was able to make the work"
4.0,"The quality didn't knock my socks off, but I was still very happy with the product considering the price. It looks and fits as expected. Perfect for a young little gymnast!"
4.0,beautiful shoe but a bit wide
4.0,"Exactly what they claimed. The surface is a tiny bit rough, but if you are familiar with 3D printers, then this is no surprise, and completely normal. The head bobbles, but it seems to be connected pretty securely (my only worry). I built a likeness of my wife for her birthday, and it really did look like her. She loved it, too."
4.0,they are very warm my feet sweat most of the day and still don't get cold. the size i got was a 10r and they fit great i normally wear an 11. my only complaint is that the tongue of the boot pokes the top of my foot but another guy that has some said they brake in and that goes away. other than that i wish i would have gotten them years ago.
4.0,Very cute! My new favorite shirt
4.0,Fits well. The stars on the flag aren't as defined as I would have liked.
4.0,"They’re an okay color. I had the grey ones with black sole before that my dog chewed up and I’ve had a hard time finding that color again. Other than not being crazy about this color, I LOVE the shoe and it is comfortable for working at the hospital."
4.0,Sunflower was way bigger than i thought have not decided if i like it so big.  The size of a quarter
4.0,The bag is okay quality worked for what I needed it too! The strap is sort of cheap but I have a detachable chain strap from another purse so I just removed the original strap from this bag and replaced it with something a little sturdier.
4.0,"Me encanto I'm in love 😍 super suave excelente calidad y el color bellísimo, compre 3 diferente color y estoy fascinada, definitivamente comprare los demás colores, el único inconveniente que tuve fue en el color azul sale una mancha blanca si estuviera en cualquier otro lado del legging no habría problema, el inconveniente es que la mancha esta en mi trasero 😅😩"
4.0,Cute dress. Pink color is not as vivid as expected (more of a dusty pink) but fit was perfect.
4.0,Very nice hooded sweatshirt for the price. Doesn't shed.
4.0,Pretty good for what I paid. They have lasted and seem to be good quality.
4.0,"It’s mostly as described, but not nearly as shiny. I’m planning to spray it with a few coats of a clear lacquer, as I wanted something with a very high gloss."
4.0,okay....sent it to a friend.
4.0,"very nice mask, worth the money, beautiful material, love them."
4.0,"These guys sell a nicer version of this case, but you should go with this version because<br />1.) It's a little smaller but still fits all but the nerdiest of the huge nerd glasses.<br />2.) The aluminum ones are so flimsy you can bend them accidentally, if you sit on those you're screwed but these ones I'd say you stand a chance if you're not too heavy.<br />3.) They're cheaper too.<br /><br />Not the most indestructible cases on the market but this is your best value if you all you want is something a little slicker than the case you get from the optometrist or Zenni. Good buy overall"
4.0,Kids loved the Hoodie but kinda pricey for the brand. Polyester and does the job.
4.0,"I purchased a Large in color Mustard.  Love this blazer, fits great.  The fabric is lightweight, stretches and it is breathable."
4.0,Great deal shipping slow
4.0,Review from my wife - this is a cute house dress or swimsuit cover up.  The design isnt great but it fits well.  The material is soft and on the thicker side.  Fits true to size.  I think its a good value.
4.0,The material os so comfortable. I'm a size 16 with curves and this dress is so flattering.  I wish they had more in my size.
4.0,"Small size, but looks great."
4.0,Great way to keep covered and the skin protected.  She wears this more than her other suits
4.0,"Received on time. Seems great quality (so far). My (adult) daughter loves it (and everyone she swims with now wants one)! She says it's absorbent, warm, and dries relatively fast. Zipper seemed ""tight"" in the beginning and she had trouble with it at first (as many other reviews stated) but after a few days, things seem to have loosened up and it's hardly ever a problem anymore. Very pleased. Recommend!"
4.0,"Pay close attention to the sizing chart as it will guide you correctly when trying to get the correct size.  I really like shirt when it is on,  its very cute on.  I gave 4 stars cause the material is fairly thin so please advise on that too.  Overall the shirt fit me how it should, I did measure myself to make sure the size was correct.  I found no flaws in the stitching, and I did not find any flaws in the material.<br />I have washed this in a regular wash and dried in my dryer and I have had no issues with the material stretching  or shrinking any at all.<br />Overall I am happy with this shirt, its is thin but works well for those hot summer days.  Very cute on!<br />I received this shirt at a discount for testing and reviewing purposes.  This is my honest unbiased opinion and have come to it by wearing this shirt myself."
4.0,Like the look. Hand wash only
4.0,Ithe was cute and served it's purpose but the size I chose should have fit my daughter well and instead it overwhelmed her... I had to roll the sleeves up just to make them 3/4 and the length was more dress then t-shirt
4.0,It's a nice fit and it looks cute on my daughter. But the material wears off fast.
4.0,Great shirt.  Fits as expected.
4.0,"Very stiff, curtain like, material. Material pattern was as described. Size was small so I'm glad I ordered 1 size larger."
4.0,Hard to keep clean. It seems they're always cloudy and that reduces the visibility. I'm constantly trying to keep them çlean! They do make my screen easier on my eyes though!
4.0,"Well made, Good fabric,perfect if they didn't fit somewhat small through the seat. I will wear them, but they won't be as comfortable as my other Hickey Freeman slacks."
4.0,Fits perfect in arms as well as tummy. Not snug. Got it next day put it on with my black linen palazzo pants and spent the whole day in comfort. Lots of compliments. No question I would buy it again.
4.0,Cute but feels snuggly
4.0,"seemed a little big, but it doesn't fall out. much better than the white bracelet"
4.0,Very durable and classy looking!
4.0,"Pants are good quality, fit well, relaxed leg. Was too long, had to be hemmed in length.<br />Good quality over all the others. Will order more of these in future."
4.0,Strap is large.
4.0,Ordered a 4x based on sizing info and definitely runs smaller than stated
4.0,"love this dress, very pretty on. lots of complements. Will need to go a size up on this one..."
4.0,***Update**** 3/29/19<br />  I'm docking a star because the arms on these glasses loosen more often. I just make a point to check them and try to be aware when they get a little loose and tighten them. I've never had sunglasses I've had to tighten so often. Meh...<br />*********<br />These are great. I have a bad habit of buying cheap sunglasses because they ultimately meet untimely demise. These were a great price and better quality than the super cheapos I usually buy at like TJ Maxx or Marshall's.
4.0,Very pretty and comportable socks.  Only issue is that the thread used for the design has no stretch or give.  The pair with the three cats is almost unwearable because it is too tight to put on without any stretch.
4.0,Lo regalé y estuvo bien.
4.0,"Two pair of sunglasses to share or keep one as a spare.<br /><br />The sunglasses are lightweight and include a sport strap to keep them on when active. They feel durable and have a uniquely flexible nose guard to get shape them to most noses.<br /><br />The frame and lenses are plastic but stylish and somewhat modern in design. There is a cleaning cloth included and (oddly) one carry case.<br /><br />These come with a polarization verification card and it works as expected.<br /><br />Longevity remains to be seen but, these are a nice set."
4.0,"I love this top! Wore once and had to spray with Static Guard, but I think that was from packaging. The fit is looser through the hips without looking like a maternity top."
4.0,So cool. Love the iridescence!!!
4.0,Flattering color and style. Washed well.
4.0,"Super cute and a huge boost to my swimwear-related low self-esteem. This suit fit pretty well. I have tried it on a couple of times at home and love it, but I put it to use yet so I can't vouch for how it will do in the water.<br /><br />Pros: Very slimming, attractive cut and print, great support.<br />Cons: feels shorter in the torso than I would like, less than flawless coverage up top (but MUCH better than I expected), higher on the hip than I expected."
4.0,"I'm 5'5&quot;, 115 lbs and I ordered a small.  I feel it's a little big for me.  Even though it feels big, I still like the way it looks on me.  Even if it's big and long, it has a nice shape that makes it flattering still.  I love it!"
4.0,"Very cute, I am really happy with the look and the feel."
4.0,These are comfy and adorable. The elastic in the waist band isn't secured and will roll or fold inside the waist band. Just need to stick it in place and will be perfect
4.0,"very nice white w/ gold heels pumps, needed white heels had to return"
4.0,"Looks great, but it is too large. I have not found a way to remove the links."
4.0,I make jewelry for my grand baby and I will use most of them. Some of them I did not know what they were but most I will use!
4.0,love the thickness! great for winter
4.0,"I like this dress. Its well made and fits like a glove. Got plenty of compliments. The only disappointment was the previous dress that I had ordered but had to return because it was small, had the flowers in the chest placed really nicely but the new one I ordered, I'm not overly impressed with the placement of the flowers in the chest area. I'll probably order a different color. I'm 5.3, 130 lbs and I ordered a medium."
4.0,Arrived on time cute bracelet
4.0,"I was hoping they would glow, sadly they don't but I'm gonna get fabric paint to fix that, other then that I love them, they are cheaply made and when the shorts are stretch you can see that the fabric is white"
4.0,"Strong, durable material. Your size chart is off though. I’m 5’8, 165lbs. According to your size chart I should be an A3, which is what I ordered, and it’s definitely a bit big. Will be getting an A2 next time around."
4.0,Looks great in relation to the price!
4.0,Longest lasting non-slip tread I’ve tested so far.  I’ve tried at least a half dozen brands of slipper socks for my elderly father.  He spends most of his days sitting either in the wheelchair or another chair. Now he can safely transfer between them without worry.
4.0,Unlike most tassle earrings these are well made and are cute
4.0,A little smaller thank I like and I got an XL
4.0,Can wear this for everyday wear. Fits true to size. Comfortable. Love the waffle look PLUS the pockets are really quite amazing. This top is really functional and great to wear.
4.0,"It's beautiful, I hope to fit in it one day."
4.0,"The stitching was a smudge off in a few places, and it was kinda tight on the shoulders and boxy everywhere else. However, it's beautiful and mostly fits if you like a loose dress shirt. I actually love it. I'm 5'3&#34; and 110lbs. I normally wear a small in juniors or xs in women's."
4.0,overall i like the watch very much.  the altimeter is accurate and the compass works great.  the thermometer works well when you take it off (normal since the body temp affects the sensor).  i like a big watch so this is perfect (initially i thought it might be too big even for my likes but i got used to it).  my only complaint is that the excess watch band comes out of the plastic holder constantly.  still would recommend it though for the price.
4.0,"I used measuring chart to order, said I should order L, they were too big so I returned and ordered M, they seem to be the same size as the L, may give it one more shot and order S.  I do like the style. Don't understand previous review about not being real leather. It should not ""peel"" off. Will see."
4.0,"Maybe I need to go up a size. Bought a medium, Im 5'1 and weight 119 lbs.  But I could not get this over my legs.  Maybe my butt is too big?  There is absolutely no stretch to this suit.  You can't just get it on if you have any type of curves on your body.  It is a cute suit but I am not able to wear it.  Got it 30 minutes ago and its going right back=("
4.0,"Did come in folded, which resulted in some stiff wrinkles and sharp bends in the wire of the brim. I attempted steaming it, which helped with minor wrinkles and shape, but the major wrinkles still persist and the site is difficult to work into a smooth shape. Includes an elastic strap in the head band to help keep it on in the wind. Good fit for my roughly average size head, but probably won't work if you have a particularly large or small head. I've included before and after steaming pictures."
4.0,Ordered on the bigger size and I’m sure it’s the size and not due to manufacturing that makes it still fit oddly right in places.  My body was made for vintage clothing so order a size or two larger but cute
4.0,"When the mask mandate in my State was lifted we all rejoiced.  Okay maybe not all of us.  But some of us certainly did some rejoicing.  We live in the desert, it's hot.  Adding any additional clothing just goes against all code of clothes here in our oven stuck on broil climate.  I do understand our current situation of living in a pandemic and I am very, very cautious.  So don't judge.<br /><br />Anyway, so I am travelling to Costa Rica in a few weeks and guess what you MUST have on your face the entire time?  Yep.  A mask.  And not just ANY mask. Nosireebob.  (it's a word. my Dad uses it) You have to have an APPROVED mask.  Ok, I really need this trip.  I haven't been anywhere except the frozen food section at my local grocery.  It is where we all hang out here in the desert on Friday nights.  We open the doors and shiver in unison.  It's a thing.<br /><br />So OK Amazon, show me masks.  Oh, here's one that even has a little airplane on it!  Let's get two.  So it arrived in 3 minutes after I clicked buy now.  Kinda freaks me out sometimes Amazon, but I do appreciate speedy service.  So I am already convinced that I am going to just hate this thing.  Open it up and  put it on and what is this?  Comfort? Heck yeah!  Breathability? Yessireebob!  Adjustable straps? Now you are just messing with me.  I'm wearing this thing all over.  Well not to the frozen food section on Friday, I DO have a rebel reputation to uphold.<br /><br />So yeah.  Highly recommend this particular face covering compliant with FAA, CDC, MSNBC and LMNOP."
4.0,"Con: The neck opening is a bit too wide and so it can easily slip off one shoulder. This is only a mild annoyance though, not a big deal.<br /><br />Pros: Most everything else. Is very soft and comfortable and fits well everywhere other than the neck. Also is very pretty, looks just like the picture displayed on Amazon."
4.0,"It's very cute, I am 5'9 and 125lbs and I'm usually a small, it showed a lot of my cheeks, but it's lingerie so I can expect that, and then the crotchless part is a total split, I don't mind it, but some people might not be comfortable with that idea. Pretty good quality material, I'll order again for sure"
4.0,"This is soft and comfortable, but runs large. I like a roomy fit and don’t like to gamble on clothes running small. But I should’ve sized down.... I could probably get away with 2 sizes down! The arm holes and neck give so much excess space for me, at 36DD, there’s no keeping the boobs inside."
4.0,i'm short and it's a bit long but the quality and fit is very comfy..I would order again.
4.0,She love the dress 👗 so did I
4.0,"I bought these for my granddaughter. They are slightly wide for her feet but stay on well. They aren't ventilated well enough to wear all day in hot weather but are great for going to the pool, playing water games in the yard, etc."
4.0,"This is a nice little bag. I only wear cross-body bags so it was perfect for me. Could us more pockets though because I like to keep things handy and readily available but other than that, I was happy."
4.0,"pretty, seems to be well made for the price, no long term quality  assessment yet."
4.0,Great looking cleats. You should size up tho. I wear a 10 and so I ordered these a 10 but there a bit tight. I should've got a 10 1/2
4.0,This isn't regular t shirt material it's more like a dri fit material. Fits a little smaller than expected but still cute and seems well made. The design is cute. If you want a looser fit I suggest sizing up.
4.0,"Perfect for travel ,<br /> easy to find my luggage at the Airports."
4.0,[[VIDEOID:6831fb67e0373a65d4c916b3dfcd2799]] Like the band. Fits well and like how it hooks
4.0,Lining was too snugged.
4.0,This dress was really pretty and i will but again. I don't expect to like the dress but i did. The colors are really pretty.
4.0,"I'm 5 foot tall, 150 lbs. Normally a size 12 and 36C. I ordered M according to the chart but I'm returning for a L. It's fits like a glove which is just a bit too clingy for me. I'm self conscious of my curves and need a little breathing room. The print and fabric are beautiful! Just need the right size."
4.0,I like it I wear it out and about.
4.0,"Order arrived promptly. Packaged nicely, fit nicely, no complaints."
4.0,The flower is larger than I expected but they are beautiful. I wear them a lot.
4.0,"This was a good mask for the money. Its comfy, ventilated well so you don't get a face full of moisture or have trouble breathing. That is why this mask has the large triangular ""beak"" at the mouth; it lets the wearer to eat, speak & drink (using a straw, though!).<br />The ribbon that allows you to tie it onto your face works. It looks fragile bit it fairly strong. I had no trouble wearing it steady for two hours. I only removed it during a bathroom break & doing so wasn't super necessary. Vision is also very good while wearing this mask.<br />I thought the finish on this item would be more of a metallic pewter, the look I was looking for & the reason I bought it over others offered here. When it arrived, I was disappointed to find the finish was a cheap looking, spray paint that was then ""washed"" with a very thin brown varnish to give it a bad ""antique"" overall appearance. Not what I wanted or needed. The photo provided by the seller was a little misleading.<br />With a little shopping, I found a ""hammered steel"" metallic spray paint that, after a little bit of prep work (masking taping the eye holes from underneath & holding the ribbon out of the way) I was able to achieve the look I wanted & needed for the event I was planning to attend. The attached photo turned out well.<br />Overall, a solid, well made mask, not a cheap department store Halloween kid's one time use costume accessory. Its comfortable, easy to attach and very customizable it you need to (see attached image). I would have given it five stars but for the cheap paint job it had on it when it arrived."
4.0,The collar is sewn a bit weird otherwise love it
4.0,Very pretty smaller than pictures shows
4.0,The bands are comfortable and a change from the “basic black” band that came with my watch. I wanted color options. They are no simpler or more difficult to attach/detach  than the original band. I think I’ll buy another set.
4.0,Kept this Florida boy warm on the slopes of Utah!
4.0,"These are the first pair of readers that I haven't had to put on and take off constantly. They're great for mid-distance and for short periods of reading and computer viewing. Unlike regular readers, I can see at a distance without everything being too blurry. The nose pads however are very uncomfortable."
4.0,"It was a gift, and my granddaughter loved it"
4.0,"It seems that zipper has a higher possibility to be broken in near future, but to be fair it's probably because the dress was a bit smaller for me than I expected. I ordered slightly bigger than my size, so I thought there won't be a size conflict.<br /><br />I realize that I won't have too many occasions to wear the dress, so I decide to return. But the quality-wise, it was a decent dress :)"
4.0,"I'm 5'9&#34;, 177 lbs. The A2 top fits well. It shrunk a bit after I washed it and the sleeves are an inch or so above my wrist joint, which is comfortable for me. But even after washing/drying, the pants are a bit long and baggy on me, and they loosen even more after I train. I probably need 1-2 inches off the bottom of the pants. Even then they'd still be a big baggier, which isn't necessarily a problem, but they don't strike me as slim fitting compared to other gi. Overall solid and comfortable."
4.0,"I ordered this strap to go with a diver watch that I ordered.  The strap compliments the watch nicely and the 22 mm fit is spot on.  The feel of the leather is soft and comfortable and it feel great on the skin.  I use this on a daily basis<br /><br />Although it's a good strap, there are some issues that you may need to be aware of. The leather thickness is a bit less than what I had anticipated, but it's not a show stopper for me. The construction of the strap is kinda odd (see picture).  Maybe there are some straps that are supposed to be like this, but for me this is the first one to use this kinda build. Takes a bit of getting used to.  My only real issue is the way the strap has been stained (or is the word tanned?).  There is a light streak in the middle with darker stain on the outside.  I see the look they were going for but it looks a bit fake, but again it's a minor point.<br /><br />Knowing what I know now, I'd still buy it."
4.0,I like this shirts 👚 forsure recommend to all my fitness junkies.
4.0,I like the look and fit of these but 2 of the 4 started unraveling after one wash. I wash on gentle cold and hand dry. Wish they lasted li get.
4.0,A bit big but overall I really like them.
4.0,very tiny penguin but pretty for a young girl.
4.0,"Soft, comfortable dress!  I’m 5’4”, 130 lbs and purchased a small in the snow leopard print.  Dress fits well and falls about an inch above my knees which is age appropriate for me at 60."
4.0,Fits perfect. Daughter loves it.
4.0,"It is a cute slim fitted top, but it is a little see through. I got the black top and I have to wear a tank underneath. All in all it fits well just wish it wasn't see through"
4.0,"The dresses are cute, comfy, and don’t really wrinkle. However, I took off one star because the size  varies from dress to dress. I have three of them in size Medium and each one fits differently. One is quite snug, but Large was too big. I’m 5’6, 153 lbs for reference."
4.0,Sleeve mucho tighto
4.0,"It's ok, but very small."
4.0,"Bought the white skirt in a size medium since most reviews said to size up — definitely did not need to. The length was perfect but the waist was definitely big, so I’d say to go with your normal size! It arrived pretty wrinkled but I’m sure with one wash they’ll come out. Other than that, great buy!"
4.0,Satisfied... Look great fits great!
4.0,Cheap material so it’s nubby after washing but my son loves it just the same. I would buy it again just for that lol
4.0,"Ordered a S, received a L, fits fine"
4.0,I just received them last night and so far so good! I love the fit and the color and it was super simply to clip on and off!
4.0,"I have this dress in black and love it! I ordered the pink and hate it!  It’s a drab color pink, muted and looks grayish to me. Aside from the color, it’s cute, short and can be worn with a bra. It’s a heavier ribbed cotton and not see through."
4.0,"This bracelet bending bar is super helpful for 6 inch bracelet cuffs (the 7 inch is too long for it and doesn't give them the right shape).  However, after making about 50 bracelets, I noticed the side of the bar that I typically position the bracelets towards was getting a little warped and not giving the bracelets the best shape anymore."
4.0,"bought these for a friend, she seemed to like them."
4.0,"Pins are great!  Received 20 of them as stated, many are hidden Mickey's. We even received an Olaf one!  My disappointment is that there is no lanyard.  It was started that a lanyard came with the lot.  For $29.99 I was expecting the order to be fulfilled properly. I'm hoping Owl Castle Toys will be sending along a lanyard once I contact them."
4.0,"The mask itself is exactly what I wanted.  It is contoured such that when I blink I can't feel my eyelids or my lashes touch it.  That was bothering me on my cheap mask.  That's the main reason I ordered it.  And I'm happy.<br /><br />The strap on the back however needs some improvement.  Being a thick single strap with velcro, it has some downsides.  First, the velco is centered so when I lie my head back, I'm lying on the velco and it is less than ideal as I feel it in a slightly uncomfortable way.  Also the amount of adjustment in the velco is not much, to the point one has to question having the velcro at all...<br /><br />The bigger problem is that it is a single strap with the strap mounted in the center sides of the mask.  The surface of the mask itself is smooth, so it easily wants to crawl up my face.  I often wake up with the mask on my forehead or off my head completely.  I'm a guy with long hair, and pulling my hair up over the strap helps (to keep the strap from also walking off the back of my head), but if this had 2 smaller straps--one slightly higher up the mask, and one lower to go under my ears--it would be a big improvement.  I may actually get out a needle and thread to fix this at some point.<br /><br />I still like the mask, but an updated revision would be good."
4.0,Really tough to get the thumb in but stayed warm and dry.
4.0,"no debating that zipper problem reported in other reviews. the placement of the zipper is just odd. however, I love the bag enough that I gave my daughter and best friend the same bags for Christmas!"
4.0,"They're actually cozy (surprise!) but I'm concerned that one is quite a bit looser than the other. Feels like it will slip off my foot as I move along wood floors. Certainly comfortable, seemingly well made indoor slipper other than the loose fit. Could be a fluke, but I'm not likely to repeat the purchase."
4.0,"I love the festive, vintage, traditional look of this skirt!  I always wanted a red plaid to wear during the Holidays.  And this one is perfect!  Made of wool and beautifully lined, it also provides warmth and a classy look.  And it does not wrinkle.  The only reason I did not give it five stars is that the zipper is on the right side.  I am accustomed to having a zipper in the back or on the left side.  I believe this was an error that could just be on my skirt.  But I can live with it."
4.0,"It looks and feels well made and sturdy for very wet days. From the picture, it looked like the outside had a pretty sheen, like parachute cloth, but it's polyurethane--looks like a dull plastic finish. I got the green, but the royal might be prettier. The lining is 100% polyester, a very thin mesh for all temperatures. Someone said it's made to resist tears, and I hope that's true. The problem I've had with these items before is that they tear easily. But I think this one is made for the professional outdoors person--I hope."
4.0,Very cute and a bit vintage.. Its not a really dressy option as the main part of the band is bare elastic but if that's not an issue then its a fun option.
4.0,"I was looking for something simple to just throw on instead of a full costume or elaborate fx makeup for Halloween -- this will suite my needs this year just fine. Fits good -- basically a masquerade mask with horns. I dig Ghoulish Productions, also. The only thing that annoyed me is that on the inside of the mask, there was blue ink scribbled all over. What's up with that?"
4.0,"Fit as expected. Very comfortable and provides good support. Feels thick and durable but not too binding or too hot. Great garment to wear under a dress or an outfit that is form fitting through the waist/hips, especially for a newly postpartum mama. I just wish the panty line was more flat and less obvious, or the rear end coverage was a little more modest and less high cut. I think the outline of the panty would show through a more sheer fabric."
4.0,"These socks are adorable, and I like that they fit at the ankle as opposed to being folded down. The elastic at the ankle is enough to hold them on but isn't too tight and doesn't dig in to the legs. The material is very nice and stretchy, making them easy to put on and giving a snug fit that's comfy in shoes. The top of the sock is a little thinner than the bottom and has a cute textured design that's shows when worn with Mary Janes. The stretch will allow for growth with your child to be able to wear these for a couple years. However, I took a star off because those years don't line up with their size chart. I got these in size 6-8 yrs for my 7 yr old, and we can get them on, but really they are too tight. Luckily, I have a younger daughter who they fit perfectly on. She just turned 5 and wears size 11 shoes. It seems a poor choice to use ages in a size chart since kids vary greatly in size."
4.0,These are super cute for the price and not huge like some climbers. Great for people with smaller ears like me. You can wear them as climbers or just let them hang.
4.0,A little shorter than I thought but overall decent quality for the price.
4.0,"You receive four packages of earrings with this purchase It comes in a black velvet bag, so it could be good for a gift. There are a few duplicates and very similar pairs included. The quality isn't super high, but they are still cute for daily wear. I split the earrings with my daughter because some of the styles are not exactly for me (I am 32 and they appear to be for younger people like hearts). Overall this is a great set. There is a wide variety of styles, and both gold and silver are included. Some of the designs are not crisp and are a little uneven, but again the price is pretty low so it is ok."
4.0,"Cute skirt and it is a good weighted fabric.  For this price, I believe it is a good purchase.  Please note, the skirt is in Asian size so I ordered a size up to make sure it isn't too tight.  I actually like it so much I got a few more in another color."
4.0,Using this for a Halloween costume. Came exactly as pictured!
4.0,"Nice, but has an odor when you get them. Grandson has a problem making it stay covered."
4.0,This set was very pretty. The packaging was not great.
4.0,Love it just the right size
4.0,Love all the Keychain choices. But the lanyard itself is a little small
4.0,"Looked like picture, good quality.  On the large side but that was my error"
4.0,"A little small, but otherwise a great product.  Very soft and comfortable.  I would buy again."
4.0,Very cute but buttons on front were not seen on well seemed like a choking  hazard. Took them off and sewed area.
4.0,Color is as shown<br />It's light weight a bit thin<br />I got compliments on it
4.0,"I ordered the Riptide running shorts and received the Taco shorts but my husband loved them so whew...  this brand of running shorts are not inexpensive but are good quality and last.  But, it would have been good to receive what I ordered."
4.0,Love ! Ran a little small to me
4.0,"The package arrived as expected,"
4.0,"I am 5'1&#34; and this product fit perfectly. I could adjust it to my desired length and it looked beautiful under my wedding dress. The lacing at the very bottom wasn't sewn evenly, sort of crooked but it doesn't matter to me since no one will see it. There was also a black smudge under all of the tulle, no idea how that appeared but once again no one will see it so it doesn't matter. Where I wear the product on my body, I also have some big hips, it does scratch me a bit where the sewing combines the tulle and satin but when my wedding dress goes over it for some reason I don't notice it much. Maybe because I get so excited wearing it. All in all I would say it's a great product, does it's job and can actually fit short women! Prefect amount of poof."
4.0,"Such a cute dress it's just not cute enough for my butt. The split is so high (not that high) in the back that when I bend over, my butt cheeks are hanging out. Due to the fact my butt is for my husband and I bend a lot to pick up my children. This dress is not for me. I would've kept it if there was not split."
4.0,I originally thought these were too gaudy but have changed my mind and realize they are well made and look good.
4.0,a bit transparent... but pretty!
4.0,The cutest Christmas pictures from this outfit love it! Sheds though so it was a little messy
4.0,nice warm hoodie
4.0,Cute shirt arrived with a hole but amazon replaced it and it’s super cute
4.0,"I love this dress. Very comfortable and fabric is very pretty. Waistline of dress sits slightly above natural waist so very forgiving, though I wouldn't quite call it empire. I am of normal proportions, and I did not find the armholes of the dress to be unusually large as stated in a couple of the other postings?  I am 5'1&#34; and it is tea length on me."
4.0,The Squid Socks really do stay on as the claim!  I think they run a little small.  I got the 6-12 months for my 7 month old grandson and it just barely fits.
4.0,Cute summer dress. Really fresh the material is stiff however the waistline is stretchy. It is thin as well but not see through.
4.0,"Just didn’t fit me and my personality, beautiful dress. It does grab or attach to hair lint etc... be prepared to carry lint gaurd or fabric sheets! If dress fits totally worth it ! Once maybe but @ the price worth the chance."
4.0,"I’m 5’2, 145 ordered a size medium it’s a little long for a romper"
4.0,Did exactly what I needed it to.
4.0,"Just got these - bought them to go with my Doc Martens. They're the perfect height if pulled up all the way, but they do seem to slip down fairly quickly. A little thin, so maybe not the best to stand the test of time. Otherwise, they seem good quality. They look exactly like the pictures, and the colors are true to the pictures as well. I am happy with my purchase, I think they add a cute little touch."
4.0,"It is quite lovely a nice dusty rose color, I had expected it to be a lighter pink, but it is still a really nice color. Beware if you have shoulders a little bit on the wider side it might be a bit tight, but it is open enough that is can be adjusted and made to be more comfortable. Lovely quality and cute lace design. As n even bigger plus it came earlier than expected by four days, lovely product."
4.0,Was expecting these to not be so good in quality but they were okay. My daughter said they were comfortable. We needed orange sneakers in a hurry and they came on time.
4.0,"Except, they are WAY over priced.  However, I needed a replacement for my ear protector microphone."
4.0,"I love this hat. 1 thing I'd change... a little too much slouch. Other than that, good quality, super soft and comfy."
4.0,Good quality just needs a draw string.  Looks like it has one but is only for looks
4.0,Size to large but great quality and fast shipping
4.0,"Pretty good product, it helps to keep the face warm while riding my motorcycle."
4.0,The shape is a little funny lookin but over all not a bad hat. The color scheme is great
4.0,This is very beautiful. But the fit isn't as beautiful. I'm pretty big up top a I had a hard time filling it out. The waist line leaves you kinda bummed as its not fitted very well. Love the concept but not something I will likely wear. It will hang in my closet as a decoration.
4.0,It is cute and small enough for teenagers
4.0,"I ordered a size 3-6 mth and it is sized to fit an 18 mth old. Although I was disappointed in the size, I was very pleased with the prompt customer service I received regarding this issue. Therefore I give this a 4 star rating for the excellent customer service."
4.0,It felt great but 2 inches too small
4.0,"First pair I order I returned it was to small for the size, I reorder the second pair one size bigger and it fit perfect my kids are very happy they loved"
4.0,These masks provide good coverage but remain a little stiff even after a few washing’s. Also not super easy to breath for long periods.
4.0,"Chain is more like 20 or 22 inches.  The necklace is pretty, but I need a shorter chain for anyone not to have to deal with looking into my cleavage to find it."
4.0,"Ordered a 5x, received a jersey that fit good but like a 4x...someone wrote a number &#34;5&#34; next to XL on the tag...odd. Still a nice jersey, CCCP is stitched on as well as the diamond shapes along the bottom trim of the jersey. I like it."
4.0,"Its sooo pretty. The only issue I do not like is the elastic ""belt"" and extra material."
4.0,"These are foxy! On my length of legs, they ended right behind my knees and it was kind of uncomfortable. Cute, though, great for Steampunk Cosplay."
4.0,"I ordered a medium...normally a 2.  It's a little larger in the waist, but fits well in the hips.  It's cute but the fabric is a little cheesy"
4.0,"I wear a size 10 and I'm 5'8 and ordered a large...it's a nice fit, except the bottom of romper is short. I will wear on vacation and give to my daughter afterwards. I dropped the shoulders down on romper so my biscuits would not show..."
4.0,Ordering more!  Rolls al teeny bit at the waist but not a big deal.
4.0,"Have been looking for pair of whit leggings to wear under dresses now the weather is getting colder.  I like the material, very soft, not shiny.  I am size 16 and ordered XXL.  At 5'4'', the leggings were a bit long.  I also found the leggings a little baggy around my knees, but not enough to send back as will work for what I need.  The waist fit and wasn't tight so I might could have gotten away with the XL.  You definitely need to wear a top or dress that will cover the tush with these."
4.0,Not the most expensive feel but a great transition piece for a young man.
4.0,"This is a beautiful ring, for the price.  There is a small stone missing, however.  Still, very pretty."
4.0,"It has a little pungent smell, but I think it would be dissipated. Other aspects are all good!"
4.0,"On the product page the lunar cycle moons appear to be white but when I received my leggings, the moons are more blue-ish. Not a complaint on my part, by any means, but it's something to take into account. Otherwise, I LOVE THEM! They are silky smooth, soft and look great! The legs are a bit long on me but I have shorter legs than most. The fit is perfect (5' 3"", 112 pounds) for a size small. They are so unusual. I ordered a pair for a friend for Christmas."
4.0,"They are yoga leggings so they are a little thinner than other workout leggings which was what I was looking for. They fit as expected and aren't really see through, although that might depend on the print you purchase."
4.0,Beautiful long necklace.  I received several compliments!!
4.0,very good article
4.0,Cute but didn’t expect it to be so small
4.0,These seem a little stiff but definitly a better quality insole than what comes standard in most boots. I've never bought this brand before. They are by far the most expensive insoles I've ever bought. If they last me a year and keep my feet from aching I'll be happy with them. They are great so far. I do a lot of walking on uneven terrain daily. Anyone who walks a lot for a living can tell you foot pain can become a serious matter. I've high expectations for these. If my feet are feeling good 6 months after using these I'll feel good about this purchase.
4.0,"This bracelet is beautiful The part that holds the two ends together did break pretty easily, but it's still really nice overall. can just take them off."
4.0,"Comfortable,  nice"
4.0,"Like other reviewers have said, the main issue of these earmuffs is how tight they are.<br /><br />In a subjective test, they have similar sound deadening abilities as the 3M earmuffs I use, maybe a little less but that can be attributed to them being a little small for my head.<br /><br />My 4 year old son loves them, for the pleasure of them being his own, and for the chance to wear them while watching me work (from a distance) with the table saw. He did pinch his finger with them somehow... some tears but no blood. So yes, they do have some serious tension.<br /><br />They also fold up nicely into a small ball. They seem like they are built well enough to last a long time.<br /><br />I got a coupon for these so that I would review them honestly."
4.0,"A little snug in the shoulders and elbows, other than that it's a good fit. It's a nice thick polyester felt with good drape. I'm going to add black trim to the lapels and wear this as a Marry Poppins coat on Halloween. It really is the perfect Mary Poppins coat. My son saw me wearing it and said ""i really like that coat mom I looks good"" and he has never complimented my clothes before, so that's something. It has good drape and it is lined."
4.0,"They are good for dress up, do need to spend a little time cutting excess strings off.  I'm probably a little critical since I have owned several authentic Dixie cup hats."
4.0,"Nothing fabulous about this necklace, it looks cute, maybe not my daughters style once she tried it on. Shipping took a while, but was an affordable necklace.<br /><br />Update: My daughter has finally came around and really started wearing this necklace, and now wears it everyday! It has survived a couple months of going to junior high school everyday and being shared by friends. She says it stretches out a little after removing but will always tighten back to the size of her neck. My daughter has now been begging for different colors. Overall the choker is holding up extremely well, for such an inexpensive price. She loves her necklace and highly recommends to other pre-teen/teenage girls."
4.0,Beautiful bracelet and functions properly. However I was expecting the blue in the picture and it was more turquoise so the earrings I got to go with it don't really match.
4.0,Material is pretty thick and not see through which is perfect! Extremely oversized and flowly but very on trend and cute!
4.0,Fit a little small but good product for the price.
4.0,"Looks cute on, but fits much smaller than anticipated"
4.0,"I thought the fit was good, snug in the right way. Def higher waisted than most which i wanted but a littler lower than expected but perhaps that’s bc I’m a little extra in the back. I found the XL to fit me well. Ordered a 2nd pair"
4.0,came fast my baby loves it ty
4.0,Good belt.  Has a rough finish on the under side making it difficult to pull through you belt loops but seems to be of good quality.  I'm using for my jeans out side around the house.  We'll come back later and update it after a few months of use.
4.0,"So I ordered the green bathing suit, and this is definitely not the color shown in the picture. But it's cute and fits well so I'll be keeping it. I'm a 5'6, $135 pounds, and a 34 D. I always wear a medium in bathing suits, but I ordered the large and I'm glad I did. The cups in the top are a little small and the straps are a little long, but it has the option to cross them over in the back, making it fit better. The bottoms are definitely low cut and cheeky in the back, but cute. Overall, pretty good for 15 bucks!"
4.0,very sexy underwear love it
4.0,Good Quality. I am 5'5 and 116 lbs and a medium was a touch too big.
4.0,I wove them into para cord clips for an AR-15.  They hold the weight quite well and tight.
4.0,"This is a cute belt, fits my average-sized waist, and is an incentive for me not to overeat. The belt does enhance an otherwise plain top."
4.0,the fit was a little small. I ordered size 8-9.5 and they were more 7-8.5
4.0,Great material not thin at all<br />Fits to big but I ordered up thinking the material was cheap.
4.0,At 5.2 tall this is a cute summer dress or nicely paired with leggings and ankle boots.  Ordered in purple color is rich.
4.0,A little tough accessing bills but great otherwise.
4.0,Husband looked great at the event. It was a little snug.
4.0,Alittle longer than I had hoped but they work fine!
4.0,"I love the fit of this tee, its also so soft! I am just a little concerned about how the design will hold up in the wash. Very nice though, vibrant colors. I wish they had more designs to choose from. I could own 15 of these!"
4.0,it is a great shoe however the laces are a bit short
4.0,These are nice gloves that will keep your hands warm. The flare openings for the wrists however will let cold air hit your wrists which I hated and had to knock off a star. I did buy another pair that had cuff coverage from the same brand I think because these were pretty good overall.
4.0,I love my belly rings!! Affordable and I have a nice selection. Good buy!!
4.0,Comfortable and light.  Perfect for working out and everyday use.  Easily clips on and off.  Can be easily exchanged for leather band for when you want something less casual.  Only one minor complaint.  Rubber bands that hold the watch band are very tight and a little difficult to push watch band through.
4.0,prety bracelet
4.0,Love it. The bracelet however flew off a few times while dancing. The latch could be stronger . I enjoyed the look  that I added to my black dress
4.0,"I thought it would be bigger, and my head is huge."
4.0,"This is a really nice jacket made of heavy, good quality leather.  The inside lining is thick and well made.  I am returning it because my husband does not like the collar, but that is just personal preference.  Jacket is very nice for the price and I still recommend it for others."
4.0,"Loved it. Very thin which I was expecting it to be. One thing that does bother me is where the lining of the shoulder is, it's too far out but other than that good purchase."
4.0,"Bought these for my girlfriend - she was skeptical at first, but she got a ton of compliments when she wore them out to the fireworks and she now loves them. Easy to charge, easy to change the colors, strobe pattern available. They do not a little dim in daylight, but at night they are plenty bright."
4.0,i thought it would flare more and be looser in the body. I would buy a larger size next time.
4.0,It’s exactly what I need stay in please  there thick and  Comfy
4.0,Lunch box
4.0,"Fits great as expected, the color is a bit lighter than pictured for the military green. Also, there is no inside collar as pictured. Warm and comfortable."
4.0,"Sunglasses are a great deal for the price and I love that they are polarized!  The only thing I did not like is they are flat to the face, meaning my eyelashes touch the lens!  ;)"
4.0,Would like to see xl option. Even though it says l/xl on website. it fits as package says large.  But for a tutu it's as expected.  Quality was good.
4.0,The only thing I would change on this is the buckle a better buckle this buckles a little bit on the cheap side.
4.0,The bracelet is better quality than I expected. It also came in a cute bag to help with gifting.
4.0,"It’s comfortable and stays cool as long as there is air or wind blowing towards the mask, but it still gets very warm around the face… but not like the other medical quality face masks"
4.0,the clip has came loose a couple times but it pops back in pretty easy. like that the cable is actually steal
4.0,"Nice colors, no fade yet. Regular amount of edge fray after heavy use. The buckle and hardware are very good and resists scratches. Comfortable and not stiff. So far these are the best budget NATO straps I've purchased yet, I'm sure I will get more for other watches. No disappointments here."
4.0,"Very soft and lightweight, a little thinner than I expected in terms of warmth, but super cozy!"
4.0,Fits my baby nice. Not cheap
4.0,"These are totally cute. While I usually try to wear as much organic cotton as possible, when it's hot and you're going to sweat and need things to wick I allow some oil-based products. These are on the thicker side, cover well, and are at a great price for the quality and cuteness. I'll probably splurge on the Day of the Dead ones next!"
4.0,"This cute apron is just perfect for any job! Whether it be housework or gardening, you have lots of pockets to put your tools, and enough coverage on your lap to keep yourself clean. I would give this item a BUY IT rating!"
4.0,Seems like good quality.  Bright colors.
4.0,"It runs small. I bought a large instead of my usual medium and it fit. It looks cheap, not many ladies can bring off this blouse as something classy. It's VERY thin and the sleeves are weird."
4.0,"The shirt and jacket were perfect sizing but the pants were a bit large on me, i ordered a medium. But it couldve been because im only 13 but i dont know. the shirt kinda feels thin but its still good. overall its good. :D"
4.0,"I really like this dress. The fit was perfect in my usual size, and the feel of the fabric is just great. Better material than I expected.<br /><br />What I was surprised by was the color. I know colors can vary between monitors, but the photo was way off from what I received. Calling it yellow would be a stretch - it's more like a cream. It's a pleasant color, so it's not a big problem, but not what I thought I was ordering."
4.0,"Love it. Strictly for fashion and not warmth, very thin. Fits perfectly.. kind of boxy at the waste but again, it's a fashion jacket only. Serves its purpose... decent by"
4.0,"I'm 5'1"", 125 lbs. Purchaded a medium but still a little snug. 4 stars cause the shirt is cute."
4.0,Beautiful but I wear until falls off.  Have had to repair 3 times now.  Would be perfect for someone takes off regularly.  But still love it entourage keep repairing it
4.0,Shorter in length than I expected
4.0,"I have a bit of an old-school bent and wearing an apron keeps my work clothes from getting schmutz on them. Totally worth it. The only downside to this apron is that the ties are only long enough to tie them in the back. Also, the black does not stain clothing worn under."
4.0,"When I ordered this bag I chose the blue one.  However, on the order page it showed the name of the blue bag, but with the pink picture.  When I tried to switch to the pink bag it named the pink bag but showed the blue picture.  As such I had no idea what I was going to get, but was hoping for the blue one.  In the end I received the pink bag.  While it was not my first choice, I do enjoy the bag and can make the color work.  I think the seller has since fixed that glitch in the ordering process but I would suggest making sure the picture and the name of the color are one and the same.  If not, you will get whatever color the picture shows, and not the name of the color.<br /><br />WHAT I LIKE ABOUT THIS BAG<br />• Fun, casual bag<br />• Spacious<br />• Adjustable shoulder strap<br />• Zippered pocket on back of purse<br />• Can be worn as a shoulder or cross body bag<br />• Affordable<br /><br />WHAT I DO NOT LIKE AS MUCH ABOUT THE BAG<br />• Lining gets stuck in the zipper a lot<br />• Cheap looking vinyl trims<br />• Lacks pockets/dividers on the inside of the bag<br /><br />Overall it is a fun, casual bag that is perfect for short over nighters or to take to the park or other such outings.  Spacious enough for the gym as well.  While I received this bag for free in exchange for my review I rate all products based on their full retail price.  I rate this bag 4 stars based on quality, features, price and durability."
4.0,Well worth<br />It!!!
4.0,These were all I expected for the 5 minutes I had them and then dropped them down the drain &#62;={ I loved them though and will surely be ordering more :)
4.0,They are what you think they are and are pretty good quality.
4.0,I really love the look and style of these however; I am fairly certain that they are not nickel free because my ears got really red. For some reason I am super sensitive to them. They are made well and I like the different sizes. Even the smallest ones are still a little bigger of a hoop than some smaller ones that I've had in the past. The posts are substantial and not as flimsy as the tiny ones I bought at WM. I would wear these all the time if my somewhat sensitive ears could stand it but unfortunately they are not for me. If you have no trouble with jewelry you will no doubt love them! I purchased this item at a discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review and all opinions are my own after personal use.
4.0,"I needed a small set of submarine dolphins to add to the back of my mobile phone case. I cut the attachment pins off and filed their bases flat so I could epoxy the dolphins to the case.  Bottom-line, I got what I wanted, a personalized phone case to remind me of my patrol days."
4.0,Not a bad purse for the money
4.0,Nice non-padded bra for the price.  Supports and lifts smoothly and roundly.
4.0,"Good cap, keeps the head warm. wish it was a little heavier (thicker)"
4.0,Very cute compression socks. They work really well but a little hard to put on and the designs left a marks on my legs but other than that I still wear them especially when I travel.
4.0,"Fun toy, just wish the actual bra was bigger, runs smaller than it is listed"
4.0,"Nice but sizes run small n supposed to be wide n aren't, order 2 sizes up"
4.0,"For the price, I am pleasantly surprised, comfortable shoes, good price, happy with the purchase"
4.0,Disagree with all the comments saying it runs small. I’m 6ft 170 and I was swimming in the m/l. Guess it depends how you want it to fit.
4.0,Great Bag but the zipper broke very easily and Stitching is coming undone 🙁
4.0,Good buy. I love them. Have the perfect look where people say &#34;are those real? &#34; lol I'll never tell. Good bargain and came wrapped like a gift! Thanks!
4.0,I loved the pitchfork style; it was very easy to assemble. The tail had a mind of its own when trying to keep in pointed upward it would bend to the side instead. The little string came off the tail after slight pressure. I had to stuff the tail in my pants for the same effect.
4.0,"The front slit was higher than I expected. I get lots of compliments wearing this dress. I like it,  But it could be a little uncomfortable as I pull down my skirt often."
4.0,I like the overall initial quality.
4.0,"I really love this! Perfect for my post-baby tummy. I didn't think it ran that small either. I first ordered a medium (which is what I would normally wear) and it fit great except for the cups which were not even close! So I decided to size up and get a large. The chest now fits (it's still a tad tight) and everything else is a little bit big. This may just be the breastfeeding, but something to consider if you have a large chest. But overall, I am super happy with it!"
4.0,"This is not a summer dress....the cotton at the top is very thick and the skirt is a harder material than the cotton on the top. It's very pretty, work-appropriate and comfortable."
4.0,love it but the middle (between the eyes) breaks easily
4.0,This outfit was nice but a small was definitely more like a medium. I gave this outfit to my daughter because I would never be able to wear it.<br />Material was nice and the ombre was on point.<br />I would love to have one if I could find one smaller to fit me.
4.0,Good product for limited usage.  My skin feels like moisture gets sucked out of it if I wear the gloves for too long.
4.0,"Good, as expected!"
4.0,"So cute and loved them , however, did not get too many for the price. They are adorable!"
4.0,"Very nice socks, fit over the knee with great &#34;stay-up&#34; fit."
4.0,"They are great however they gave me a headache at the end of the day, too small."
4.0,"What a fabulous underlayer - I have gone from sweatshirts and sweaters to this and a light second layer and for the first time this year, I am warm. It is fitting but not tight and it feels soft as anything. I want more but there are no other colors than black, the only drawback, that's the only reason for 4 stars instead of 5"
4.0,"Awesome ring, nicely polished, durable, nice red eyes, a size too big though :/ so beware of ring sizes because it might be a size bigger than what your used to."
4.0,"Very cute and the material quality is as expected, the cups are smaller than I  expected and don’t fit right, probably better for smaller chests"
4.0,I really like the watch but its a pain in the ass when it comes to check the time
4.0,"would like for the size to be a little larger, maybe 1 1/2 or 2&#34;"
4.0,"Bought this jacket for hiking. I run warm but always need an extra layer at the peak. This jacket is just that. A lightweight, easy to fit in my pack jacket. At first I was unsure I’d like the material but it’s surprisingly quiet while moving. Haven’t tested it in  super cold temps but so far it’s perfect for the money I wanted to spend."
4.0,This is a good product and I like it
4.0,First thing is that I didn't realize it was coming from China untill after it shipped. This makes for a long wait. Having said that it arrived 9 days earlier that it's supposed to. Which made me happy.<br /><br />Second thing is I'm concerned that because it came from China the quality of stainless steel may not actually be 316L. That being said it beautiful and shiny. The rings where all closed well upon arrival.<br /><br />My use for this required me to open a couple rings to remove attach the lobster claw and to attach it. I noticed that opening and closing rings seemed to have no impact on the luster or finish of the rings. This gives me hope that it is 316L but only time and wear Will confirm that. I'm very hopeful.<br /><br />If reglur wear doesn't change the finish I'll be upgrading this review to a 5 star.
4.0,The dress is really pretty and fits nicely but it is a little tight despite being a 2x and for my weight I normally wear a large to xl. Oh and I love the material.
4.0,4 starts because the socks started to tare at the seams after a few months of light use. Not as robust as they could be. Fit well when worn with Vibrams Five Fingers.
4.0,"The hat fits great. When you soak it, it gets quite cold to the touch. The only problem is, the only part that doesn't cool down is the band inside the hat. Unfortunately,  this is the only part of the hat that touches your head.<br /><br />It is still a great hat, and it keeps the sun from burning your neck & ears."
4.0,"I loved the idea behind the style of the top but for my body, the top just isn't supportive enough. I really bought the suit for the bottom, which are amazing. I'm not a little girl and these bottoms still come up high enough that I'm totally comfortable in a 2-piece suit. Really looking forward to wearing these bottoms paired with the top I boight for them."
4.0,"Great socks. Even though they say men's, they really are gender neutral. They are soft, snug around the arch and don't slip from the heal, which are all areas that poorly made socks have issues with."
4.0,"The dress fits pretty well and looks decent. The material is a little cheap, but it’s to be expected at this price point. The ribbon belt is pretty awful though, so I’d recommend using your own belt. Fit is food. I’m 5’7 for reference for length."
4.0,Its beatiful it looks like in the photo
4.0,I love this swimsuit!! I'm 120 and 5'3 and got a medium and it fits wonderful. The only downside is that you can see through the flower parts so wear black nipple covers under it
4.0,Remarkably comfy. Good fit. Great value for the price - I will be ordering more color options!
4.0,"The colors online really are a match in person as the top is a dark mustard color with the ruffle bottoms in true white with a floral design on it. The material is a bit stiff in the shirt, and does wrinkle after a while, but there were no loose strings on it.  The button on the back fit through the slit nicely, and as for the bloomers there was one loose string, and that was it.  I ended up getting the 18 month size, and my daughter is 11 months old now. It did fit, but you can see the top was a bit big. But the bottoms were the perfect size, so I'm afraid she wouldn't fit this at 18 months old as the elastic was perfect around her waist and legs.<br /><br />This outfit did get in the wash and dryer without my realizing it, and...yes...the outfit is ruined as it shrunk! But the funny thing is that it actually shrunk down to a 12 month old shirt now.  But the bloomers also shrunk a little bit, and while I can still get them on her it's a tight fit now.  So please hand wash these items and lay flat to dry! Otherwise it's an awesome outfit for a doll. LOL!"
4.0,Sizes run very large.
4.0,I like the bag and the color is true to what was pictured. I just wish it was more structured (sit on its own)  and had a zipper pocket inside to hold cards or money.
4.0,Nice fit but not much swing at the bottom. So I would say it fits a tad small.
4.0,This is a One size fits All and was big on me.  I generally wear an XL.  The only complaint I have is that there was no closure so I added a clasp to hold it closed while wearing it.
4.0,Received as advertised. Product worked fine for 2 months then apparent wear of fabric resulted in slippage. Hence wouldn't stay tight.
4.0,shrank a little in the wash but otherwise its as expected
4.0,Not as much color variety as pictured.
4.0,"These slip-on style slippers are easy to like. They're easy to slip on and off, and they stay on.<br /><br />The bottom is hard and shoe-like. The rubber sole should last a long time, and it is also anti-slip.<br /><br />One of the best features is that the slippers are machine washable. Probably not the most attractive slipper out there, but if you're looking for comfort and durability, this is a good choice."
4.0,Only drawback it is a little heavy due to the batteries
4.0,"Pretty color, love that it has pockets. The material is a more heavy than expected and it's a little more dressy than expected. Overall, happy with my purchase."
4.0,"It is very nice, the cord is brown, I thought it was black in the photos and there are no hearts on the end pieces, I like it and would recommend this, they should state that the charms are not the same, mine are flowers"
4.0,The quality and colors are good. The problem is that it's way to small to fit my first graders folders in. Good for a small child not a school aged child.
4.0,"Great color but the fit was too small. I ended up giving this to a friend and she dressed it up, dressed it down... it’s a versatile piece."
4.0,The hat is of great quality. I just wish the writing on it was sewn on the cap.
4.0,"Easy to purchase, given as a gift!"
4.0,I loved it up until it just fell a part today for the second time
4.0,"I bought the appropriate “sister size” for my current size but this particular bra seems to fit a little differently on me than other bras of the same size...maybe it’s the style? Maybe it’d have fit me before I lost some weight. Seems like a nice bra, though. No squeaky wires or anything, and feels and looks nice."
4.0,Great dress. I did find it to be a little loose under the arms. I am 5’2 and 125 pounds. I bought the medium & it fits great except for under the arms...it’s not horribly loose. I’d just prefer it a little snugger. (I do not have a small chest so you may want to consider a size smaller if you do)
4.0,Nice band.  Pain to adjust - use Dremel tool.  Comes with beefier 1.8 spring bars.  Paired with a Casio MD106 dive watch.  Clasp seems very secure.<br /><br />My $67 investment (watch + band) drew compliments from a guy wearing an Omega with their sharkskin bracelet  (for which the clasp alone is 10x the cost of this band).
4.0,"Really pretty. I was afraid I would break it trying it on, however, it fit and is very attractive. Recommend for medium to small wrists."
4.0,"Wrinkles easily. Zipper area very fragile, zipper will break if you must tug on it."
4.0,These ties are pretty great quality considering the price. They do run a little short so if you are on the taller side you'll have to be conscientious while tying.
4.0,"So this shirt is very cute, however, I wasn't expecting the material to be as thin as it was. That being said, it wasn't see-through, everything was still covered, it was just a lot thinner than I thought it was going to be. Still very cute and flattering, though! The only thing I thought was kinda weird was that I ordered a Medium because it said here that it was the smallest one they had available, and they gave me a small size instead. A little confused? Yes, but Disappointed? No. I /am/ small, and this fit just the way I wanted it to. One more thing, as you can see in the pictures, on mine, the neck is a little odd, but I think it's just because it doesn't /quite/ fit to my teenie tiny neck, so I imagine if my neck was a little bigger, those little ruffles would be very minimal."
4.0,Did not like the quality very well it looked a little cheap!
4.0,"Iiked the elephants, little disappointed I thought it would have been little more protection!"
4.0,"Basic stud and link set. Nothing fancy, just the essentials."
4.0,"I love mine. So nice having a leather band instead of the silicone which makes me itch.  I have a large wrist however, not sure how comfortable it would be for a narrow wrist because it's wide."
4.0,"These are good socks that provide a really low profile making them ideal for slip on type shoes and flats.  It’s too soon to say how durable the socks are, but they appear that they will be."
4.0,This is perfect if you're looking for a lighter weight hoodie. I like the fit and the look. Washes up without shrinkage. A really nice product!
4.0,"It's adorable and my kitty-loving daughter thinks it's wonderful. It is a synthetic knit, spandex or spandex-like material. It is smooth and soft on the skin. However, if natural fibers are a priority, this isn't right for you. For us, it was an exception we had to make for such a cute dress that puts such a big grin on her face."
4.0,"These earrings are as cute as ever. But sadly, they sent these post earrings in a flat package, so they both got bent in shipping. I am really hoping I can fix them with pliers. :-("
4.0,I really like this shirt. But it is a smidge small. I could have exchanged it but kept it. Comfortable.
4.0,Cute bag well made shipped in a rainfall amount of time.
4.0,"Great fit. I love the thinness of the fabric, which makes it great for summer. My only issue is that's its not true to color. Its more of a &#34;Natural&#34; than a Beige."
4.0,They are the most comfortable and they go with all of my denim...they came packaged so well I have never seen anything packaged as well....
4.0,"Fits great. I’m 5’7, 176 lbs 38DD. Size 12 was perfect."
4.0,"I was looking fo sunglasses that would fit over my prescription glasses, or ones I could wear by themselves. These glasses work very well both ways. They screen well form the side, and don't seem to fog up. I would recommended them wholeheartedly."
4.0,I looked all over the net for hankies for my dad for christmas and these were the best deal i could find. Too bad i found them a week later in a store for less money. live and learn
4.0,"This size/color has the slip resistant strips on both sides so there is really no incorrect way to put them on. They reach just above the ankle. If you want them to fit higher on your calf, order the larger sizes."
4.0,"These fit my 4 year old perfectly. They are so cute and are great for blue light protection, but my daughter just didn't want to wear them. I don't know if they just aren't comfortable for her, as she can have a harder time communicating, but they were just a no for her. I don't think it's fair though to say that's a negative towards the glasses themselves. Afterall, she's 4."
4.0,it really works specially when i put it on me while doing my work out at the gymn. 2 inches trimmed my muffin tops in  two days. it's very comfortable. sweats around my waist pours down amazing!.
4.0,Very pretty as and comfy
4.0,"The tie is exactly as it says, a black self-tie bow tie. Looks great.  Not sure on the sizing though as I am a 17.5&#34; neck size and had to put this out to full length to make it comfortably fit. Great buy for the price."
4.0,Good material. Lettering put on well. If you're large busted it's a little hard to see some of the wording.
4.0,Waytoo small but loved the look it could have provided. Will have to return.
4.0,This is as expected. I should’ve gotten longer because the pic shows an image or drawing of someone with a more slender neck. Chain doesn’t lay where I’d like it to but works well for my slimmer daughter
4.0,"Very beautiful, was a gift for my mother & she fell in love with it!!  Material was sooo silky & comfortable however watch the stitching might need reinforcement.  She doesn't get out any more & this made her feel very special, Thank you."
4.0,"Loved the fabric but the cut was WAAAY to huge. The waist was about right for an 11. I usually am a 10 in women's so thought these would be nice and roomy for sleeping, because I have yet to find lightweight boxer shorts for women to wear to sleep in...but in these, I looked like I was wearing a tent. Part of it was the size but part of it was the cut. So hard to find lightweight boxer shorts with longer legs that are well-designed."
4.0,"I bought these specifically for car road trips. The gloves are very comfortable and light. I haven't done an all day sunny trip wearing them yest, but so far am pleased with the product."
4.0,"Very good hypoallergenic earrings. However the backing has plastic on it which kind of irritates my ears and the rhinestones were a little smaller than I thought they would be, but not a big deal. I still wear them everyday. They match everything and are super cute."
4.0,Not so bad! I wanted it because of the T-back look which i like. Medium support which is also okay. No complain for the price of it! You get what you pay for!!!
4.0,"For the size, it is more for someone with small shoulders or narrow shoulders, tight in the shoulder and across the chest, but plenty of room everywhere else."
4.0,Nice that it's lined. I'm short so it's a bit long but perfect with heels!
4.0,"Love the hat for a goofy sideshow at birthday parties etc. Bright festive lights and festive hat colors.<br /><br />Two critiques, however: the first is the packaging it came in caused the hat to be smooshed and it took a while to get it to take shape, and secondly, there should be a brief set of instructions enclosed to show how to prepare for use.<br /><br />All we need to know is to remove the strip from battery case and where the on button is. By the way, there is a descreet black button on the front of the hat that activates the lights and it has three modes."
4.0,"Good fit and perfect for light wear, but also very thin. I don't think they'll last very long wth heavy athletic wear."
4.0,Wish it came in half sizes. Ordered true to size and found it to be a bit big.
4.0,Good quality at a low cost
4.0,"The dress looks great and fit as expected. The back bunches a little bit and needs to be pulled down, otherwise I’m very happy for the price it is worth it."
4.0,"Really nice glasses nice color goes with anything, the only reason I gave four stars instead of five, is I wish they were a little bigger."
4.0,"These look more light-pink than white, but they're definitely paper white. Otherwise, they're sturdy and I get a  lot of compliments on them"
4.0,The waist is a tad large for the legs
4.0,"It is beautiful!  However, I ordered rose gold and it came in yellow gold.  The fit is perfect - not too loose or too tight."
4.0,"Good for the price. Material is cheap but it is good for the purpose of having fun and taking beautiful pictures with the family cooking during Christmas. I would recommend it? Yes. Design is good and it looks beautiful. If you want a beautiful photo with family or friends cooking together during Christmas time, this  set is good."
4.0,"The shirt is great however, it's a little tight."
4.0,"Very nice bracelet. Quality is on par with the more expensive ones, but the beads do not stagger, so you end up with all the purple and all the silver in the same place."
4.0,I use a 2.0 amp battery and I can't imagine a 1.5 being much smaller but the placement of the battery is in a awkward spot. Specially sitting in the truck. Other than that great product! Rigid really comes through.
4.0,"nice leather,will wear it open but wish I could snap it"
4.0,A little snug but love the shade will buy again in a larger size.
4.0,It fits small but is beyond adorable!
4.0,This purple is everything! So pretty. I’m going to size up to a medium because it was tight on my thighs. They’re also long but I’ll be tucking them inside of my Uggs. I’ll see if I like the large better on me.
4.0,The charm fell off the next day.  Easy fix though.
4.0,"I bought the first pair in May 2017. I travel with them a lot and the just broke mid November 2017. The arm broke off when I was putting them on. I think they are great if you have trouble sleeping and want to walk around the house with them on after the sun sets. They always help me fall fast a sleep. Going to buy another pair now, only because they work well at night and are inexpensive."
4.0,It is a cute outfit. I am a size 16/18 so I got a 2xbox. It is a little big in the pants but still wearable.
4.0,If it says it has a lid it needs to be a what it says
4.0,This is a great tallit. I love the colours. Just holding it makes me want to pray even more. The inscription in Hebrew is great. It's my first tallit and I would recommend it to anyone looking to buy one. I'll give it four stars because of one or two small issues with the tsitzit's.
4.0,VERY CUTE SHOE SOCKS AND THEY FIT PRETTY GOOD
4.0,"Looks exactly like the picture. It's sturdy, it's just big which is the only reason I gave it 4 stars, I have to keep my hands open all the time so it won't fly off. It comes in a cute gift box. It's 8 and a quarter inches around. My wrist is 6&#34;"
4.0,"I bought this as a Christmas gift, It was a huge hit., Very comfortable and warm and stylish."
4.0,"Bottoms fit as expected. The top fits a little large, but still fits fine. Love the style and colors. Helps a new Mom of two feel good in a swim suit without being self conscious!!!"
4.0,I picked my usual size for sport bras which is a medium.. it's cute but no matter how much I tighten it and bent down im flashing my whole chest. Maybe a small would've done better for an A cup but I won't buy it again
4.0,This and a few other charms from the same seller look great and I had no issues having dates engraved on the back side of them. I am very pleased.
4.0,"The bathing suit is super cute, i thought it might not fit well but it actually did even maybe a little big. I am usually a size 16 I ordered size 18 for this, the top part is a little smal but it works well I wear a 44DD"
4.0,Looks very pretty only con is that I did not receive the headband
4.0,"Solid bike shorts for the price.  Good fit, elastic and padding.  Not particularly stylish, but then they're bike shorts."
4.0,"Heavier material than expected.  Runs a bit small if you are just looking at the typical sizing.  I am busty (32DDDD), 5'6&#34;, 135 lbs and ordered a large based on the provided measurements; they were spot on.  This will be a great comfortable dress for lounging around and casual.  I could get away with a small in the hips but the bust does not agree for me - so, I am good with the loose fit.  This would be cute with a pair of Chucks :)  The brand Doublju has unbelievable quality for such inexpensive prices!  I have an entire cart full of items to get :)  You won't regret this!"
4.0,"Flimsy, but served their purpose at our construction themed party.  The kids (ages 2-6) had fun wearing them."
4.0,oK
4.0,perfect for camie cosplay
4.0,"I did not think this would fit me as I wear usually a 22 dress and carry most of my weight in my belly, but this fit very comfortably. I just wish it had more poof to it. It doesn't stand out as much as I had hoped. But overall, a nice petticoat, especially considering how comfortable it is."
4.0,Very nice rich comfortable jacket.
4.0,Colors were nice sticks are great however the end piece that helps kids hold it in my opinion should be wider. My kids  Love the ones at the Renaissance festival I was expecting the ends to be similar to those.
4.0,I love the style of this bathing suit but not for girls that have a chest
4.0,"Good product, took over a month to get though."
4.0,I like the color and they are very functionable.
4.0,Loved the skirt. Reason for 4 star vs. 5!isnthatbthe name of the company is on the hemline. Prefer to have name Upson the waist instead.
4.0,"Vibrate colors, quick delivery. Looks very good on, glad I made this purchase."
4.0,"Very thin, I thought it was paper apron. Serves its purpose but I’m not buying this again."
4.0,I got this for my wife. The only thing she doesn't like is the rope type necklace. I will say it looks better in person than the picture.
4.0,"This is a nice coat with interesting styling.<br /><br />So far in crazy Chicago weather it has done fine keeping me warm, without overheating.  The only challenge is being on a crowded train without room to remove it or being indoors with it on for too long - it gets a bit roasty, but obviously that's not the intended use for a coat...<br /><br />The styling is super-cute, however I probably could have used an inch or so extra width for bulky clothes.  (I tried ordering one size up in a different color & it was HUGE, so I just decided to keep this one.  Why a different color?  Because this one is over $30 more in the next size up, which IMO is ridiculous.)  Nice size zip pockets on the sides & a breast pocket inside.  The inside zip comes to the waist, but the outside shell snaps lower, so you can unsnap for getting into a higher vehicle without fear of wrecking the zipper.  The hood is very fuzzy and warm.  There is a cinch on each side of the waist with two options.<br /><br />A few issues...  #1 the zipper is cheap.  I noticed this first on the larger coat I sent back.  However, it is also an issue on the one I kept.  If the zipper is not PERFECTLY aligned at the bottom, the zipper gets a few inches up, separates & then jams up so you can't move it in either direction, then have to pull one side through.  Not at all happy with that, and I am being extremely cautious in making sure it is aligned to try to get more than one season out of it.  The hood is very open, so in a Chicago wind it is a losing battle to keep it up if you haven't snapped the neck all the way to the top.  You might be able to change that with a scarf on the outside of the hood to snug it up.  Otherwise you had better be comfortable with one arm up to hold it.<br /><br />Toss up - I am on the short side and the neck of the coat comes up to my nose if I don't shrug it down.  I think I would prefer to have about an inch less on it, because it cannot be easily folded down.  However, for the nasty blowy days if the hood isn't cooperating in the gusts and I don't have hands free, my neck & lower part of my head are covered, which is nice.  I think I'd still prefer the neck a touch shorter (or perhaps softer material) & a way to snug the hood slightly.  The arms are the perfect length for me and I'm happy there, but if you are tall or have long arms, you may have the opposite issue (maybe the neck would be fine, but the arms would be too short).<br /><br />Anyhow, it is a cute coat & I have received compliments on it, but I feel like they have a few kinks to work out in terms of quality & fit."
4.0,The design is not bad but at least the quality could of been better. It feels like plastic.
4.0,The only reason it gets only 4 stars is because I've only worn it twice.  It fits as expected.  Will update within a few more wears!
4.0,"I ordered the shirt as a small because I'm a petite teenager and smalls are usually just right or slightly large. but when I got the shirt whenever I lifted my arms the Hirt and sleeves rode up a little. however not enough for it to be Too small. I love the material and the design is absolutely perfect. it's soft, machine washable, and so cute!!"
4.0,The bracelet is very pretty. I suggest you gently side on the first few times as it takes awhile for it to stretch out enough to go over your hand. I ordered the regular size and it fits how I’d like just doesn’t stretch enough for the first few times. I do love it!
4.0,This dress is ok. I normally wear a large in Miusol. I think I could have gotten away with a medium. The back and middle of this dress was somewhat bunched up. Very comfortable. My measurements are 38-28-38
4.0,My step daughter just graduated with her teaching degree.  I was pleased to find these and she really liked them.
4.0,Great shoes for the price. My only complaint is that they are difficult to get on for my six yr old. Seems like the opening is small and made for a more narrow foot. If you kid has a wider foot I would suggest a water shoe with an adjustable strap
4.0,"This cover up is very pretty and lightweight, can’t wait to wear on my upcoming Mexico vacation! It was a bit shorter than I expected, it hangs just below my butt (not to the knees as it looks in the pictures). I still love it though! Would definitely order again!"
4.0,"I do like the bag. It looks as pictured, which is not always the case. I will say it's not the quality I expected though. I hope it will withstand the test of time because I do tend to wear these bags out. I'll give it a few months and rewrite if necessary."
4.0,"Looks nice on, but it is a little tight."
4.0,creepy and funny
4.0,Like it order again
4.0,They work nice. I charge them on my laptop and they are ready to go for a couple days. They are bright enough for my nighttime walks.
4.0,Perfect size and nice design.
4.0,Didn't like the pattern ad much as my two other ones so a 4.  Otherwise perfect.
4.0,I like the boots...they run a little small but they are comfortable at a good price
4.0,It was a little bit tight on the brest I usually get medium but it fit very nice 😊 good material
4.0,Shoes were cute my daughter loved them. Be careful the sole of the shoe seems to be weak only after 3  days of use.
4.0,"These work well, but seem to be a bit too small to handle easily when trying to get them into the button hole. Once they are in, it's all good."
4.0,"These come marked with strange sizes. I ordered M, but received XL. I think this has to do with the intended market. It looks like the labels are in Chinese."
4.0,"The print and the fit of the dress are both awesome! Fabric is really nice too and iI it that the entire dress zips. I like the length and the boxy fit a lot although I probably should have gotten a meduim. I'm 5'6&#34; and about 145/150 so I thought a large would be good. If I decide to get the eyeball print (which I'm sure I will) I think I will get it in medium. I'd say good to either dress it up or down. My only complaint is the neck, it's a little swimmy and not quite as form fitting as I would have liked. Hopefully that should be an easy DIY but we'll see. Overall pretty pleased."
4.0,I'm a small but got a large. I went up two sizes.  Because of size difference.
4.0,I like these shorts. They fit good and good material. The only thing is that they were a little too short for me.
4.0,"Putting on fluffy slippers signals the end of my work day and starts relax time.  I ordered them a little large,because that's how I like slippers to fit.  they were what I expected.  So far (about a week) they are warm and comfortable.They don't do the dishes, but my feet are comfortable while I do them/"
4.0,I really like the dress.  The quality is decent for the price.  Only complaint is the length.  I am only 5'2 and it is super short on me.  It needs 2 more inches on it.  I have to constantly check it so my good girl is not hanging out
4.0,"SUUUUUPPPEERRR cute! Surprised with the quality. But those slash pockets gap open if the pants are too small and these were definitely too small. Sadly, returned."
4.0,The print colors and material is very good. Wish I had ordered one size up.
4.0,good product for price 👌
4.0,not bad.  Glass is clearer when the sun actually strikes it.
4.0,"Great blouse, color is same the picture, ordered M, its somewhat large but nice"
4.0,Bright.  Fun.  Worked Well.
4.0,I gave it to my friend and she said she liked it 😊
4.0,"Love the soft texture, feels much more expensive than they are. Will be buying again!"
4.0,I really like this dress and I would have given it five stars but when I received it today it had a hole where the middle seem is sewn. Also is very low cut. I am a 36D and 190 lb and normally wear a size 14. I ordered an extra large and it fits perfect.
4.0,These are really nice - the fabric is quality.
4.0,"These are great for the price and fit perfectly. I’m 5’5, 135 and ordered a small. Definitely will buy more. The only complaint I have is that the inner thigh seam is a little itchy."
4.0,I’m am really amazed with this dress is fit me perfect  the only thing is that it looks a bit cheap but for the price I think it's fine.<br />I ordered size M and the size is real size.<br />Tank you amazon!!!!
4.0,"[[ASIN:B01DG17YMQ Samsung Gear S2 Classic Band, V-MORO Pink Replacement Rubber Band For Gear S2 Classic Smart Watch (Pink)]]<br />I love this rubber band. The color is so pretty and looks very good with my Samsung Gear S2. The only thing because I don't give you 5 stars is because there was a delay in delivery due to arrival at incorrect carrier facility."
4.0,"Lovely set of bags! The quality is great and it's put together well so it does not look cheaply made. My only issue was that the metal around the handle makes a lot of noise. If that does not bother you, definitely purchase this bag! I got loads of compliments on mine."
4.0,My daughter wore this for a Pagent and got many compliments on the dress. She is 5'10&#34; and we wish the dress was longer in the front. The beading was loose and I had to do minimum repair. We ordered a 16 . Wish the size would have been a bit larger. So make sure to up your size.  She did wear it off the shoulder. We love the stretch in the dress to do this.
4.0,"I have no complaints about these shoes, except that I wear them too much and I think they will wear out pretty fast. The shiny surfaces of these shoes are not going to look good once they crease and crack....."
4.0,"I was pleasantly surprised with this lace top.  I really like it.  I did order a size up and the fit is fine.  For the price, well worth it."
4.0,Needed a rectangle umbrella for my side deck. Works good to keep the rain of my husband when he grills.
4.0,"The lightness of the jacket and the color are perfect (maroon). I ordered a size up as suggested but it is too big. I feel that only bigger busted women would need a size up. The flaring bottom part (skirt-like) of the jacket is too big. It still looks great with pants, but if you are wearing a skirt or dress (especially flary), it is not a good much. I would have reordered in my regular size, but I wear a lot of dresses."
4.0,"I am happy that I got a fashionable bag which was the right size with my favorite color !  Great purse! Awesome quality for the price. It is super cute and it is small but there's enough space to hold all the essentials of mine. The zipper on the inside is big enough to organize  all of my small things like key ,coins ,small phone, ear phone like that.it has a  retro circular ring and tassels decorations which is very nice . Highly recommend!"
4.0,was not expecting the gold in it thought it was all black and silver
4.0,It dose the job
4.0,These were very pretty but i had to return them due to weight. They were too heavy for my ears.
4.0,"It works for counting steps. Has a light on it. So the complaints that everything black makes it hard to see are crap. The hands also glow for a bit if exposed to enough light. The app works great, would have given it a higher rating if it would sync with the dicks sporting goods app so I could earn my points for getting steps. Has 5 alarms that can be set via the app. All in all not a bad watch or step tracker."
4.0,This dress is beautiful and fits great my curves are perfect in this
4.0,"It fit surprisingly well!! The bottoms looked huge and I was nervous I got the wrong size. However, I tried them on and they fit really good. Super cheeky! The top is decent, could fit a bit better but it works and looks sooo cute! How well the top holds really depends on your chest size. Love the scrunchie that comes with it. Amazing deal considering the price. Bathing suits are unreasonably expensive. You pay for a full bathing suit and a scrunchie for the same price you’d typically pay for a top alone elsewhere. Id give it five stars if the top was better quality. Regardless, I have very happy with my purchase and know that I wouldn’t get a better deal anywhere else."
4.0,"I bought this because the fabric design is so unique.  But I assumed I’d need to redesign it, and I did.  Took it apart, added front and back darts, removed excess side-seam fabric, and shortened it to look more like a tunic (to wear with leggings.  Now it’s fab, and I love wearing it!"
4.0,These are beautiful on!
4.0,Too much trouble. Get Marge Plus instead.
4.0,Got these for my grandson he likes the cat in the hat.
4.0,"I've gotten some compliments on my ""beautiful"" mask, but I've also found it to be quite comfortable and not as steamy on my glasses as some masks."
4.0,"Arrived fairly quickly, all parts included. Looks just like the picture.  It is, like other reviews have stated, difficult to put on without help. The ball fastens are so tiny and hard to grip so I used a spike fastener that was the same gauge from a different earring, the spike is easier to grasp for me to put on myself. Here is what it looks like on my ear: http://s999.photobucket.com/user/liloved1000/media/Amazon%20Reviews/P1010784.jpg.html?sort=3&o=0<br /><br />Fairly decent size, not too heavy.  I would not recommend sleeping in it, could be uncomfortable and the fastens might unscrew.<br />Overall I am very happy with my purchase even though it requires some patients to put on. I would recommend it.<br />Couldn't give it five stars just because of the learning curve to fastening the earring on. The earring itself seems to be high quality and will def. attract attention."
4.0,"Just like earlier reviews, sometimes the elastic around the legs aren't quite as functional as desired, so they sometimes ride up. Other than that, looks great and feels normal."
4.0,Love this bra ..... Once it got broken in
4.0,Ran a little same but ok
4.0,really pretty but kinda hurt after a while.
4.0,I hate masks and only wear when forced to. These are at least some what comfortable. They do stay below my beard.
4.0,This bag is big enough to hold everything that I need.  Very roomy.
4.0,Like the variety and styles. Some of the fake septum break very easily. Overall people think it's real worth the price of No pain!
4.0,"Pretty top, but it runs a big large. Sleeves are very long. I had to have them hemmed. The green color is beautiful."
4.0,"It does have a stretch band to make it fit better but if you have a 25&#34; head like I do, it's a bit tight."
4.0,"I really like it! Wish it were a tiny bit shorter, will probably get it hemmed. But its simple, elegant, and good quality. can't go wrong!"
4.0,I am a lady and I bought these for work because I am a server and have to wear black socks for my uniform. Six pairs of socks for $4 is a great price in my opinion. They are quite thick and cushy which I personally like but I know some don't and the mid sock area is elasticized so the socks will fit snug. (It doesn't appear this way in the photos and that's why I am bringing it up.) I wear a 7 in women's and the socks fit me amazingly. They are pretty stretchy but if you have very large man feel I wouldn't recommend because I think they might me too smug for you. Over all I like them a lot and will purchase again if the dryer eats these.
4.0,Classic white blouse.
4.0,Love the suit.  Looks just like the picture.  Only gave 4-stars because the top is big.  I bought a XXXL but definitely thing I could have gotten away with a XXL or maybe even a 1XL so i suggest ordering your true size.  I may order in a smaller size and give this one away.
4.0,"I really love this bag. However, the snap botton on the exterior pocket is already coming off. I believe the material of the bag cannot sustain the constant opening of the  pocket."
4.0,"I like these earrings a lot so far. They're larger than I expected, but not too big for everyday wear. I don't think they'll be too uncomfortable to sleep in. The main issue is that the backing that comes with them is extremely loose. An earring fell out almost as soon as I put them in and started walking around. I'm not a fan of that type of earring back with the plastic disk in general, but these seemed particularly loose. I replaced them with small, standard metal backs, which makes the earrings droop a littlw, but I'm not worried about then falling out. Overall I'm really happy with the pair and think they look very nice.<br />I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review."
4.0,Although this bra allows for you to insert padding for a bit more support they  are not included with the bra.
4.0,"It worked well for our weekend camping trip however, the fabric seems to be coming apart where the colors are stitched. They will probably last until she outgrows them but I won't feel comfortable handing them down to anyone because they are already starting to fray."
4.0,Nice quality but wasn't right for me so was returned and had no issues doing that.
4.0,"Cute, Great conversation piece."
4.0,"More for style and less for warmth. Thin and airy, but fit well."
4.0,"I have to return it because it arrived without the Halo, looks beautiful and steady.<br />Laura - LA 10'2022"
4.0,"Somewhat large up top, but l like it 🙃"
4.0,"I love them, but I guess my son is a little tiny for his age. We went to a water park and they fell off of his feet. One of the lifeguards found them. We were walking around looking and asking for it. I do love them though."
4.0,"When reading reviews for what I thought was for the wrap around dress, I quickly discovered that most are for other dresses. My review is for the black wrap around dress. It arrived as it said it would (I have prime). Nicely packaged. Its very shimmering which is what I was hoping for and stretching. I’m 5’’4 217lbs & bra size 38DDD top and mid section heavy and purchased a XL. I purchased very last minute for an adult prom function and decided to take a chance on it mainly because it was Prime lol but also can’t go wrong with a wrap around dress. Once you figure out how to tie it, depending on how much leg slit & cleavage you’re comfortable with, it fits nicely and perfect. I had on a black spanx suit I guess you call it, has shorts and exposes the breast area, so I wore a nicely fitted black bra, also purchased on Amazon. I say this to say that the shimmer is very nice but in lighting it might be see through a little (not too sure cause I had black spanx). The ONLY flaws for me were one it had a tear near the seam by the side, under the sleeve to which I had no choice but to sew myself because again I had no time to return it and I really liked how it fit. Secondly- I personally wished it was longer…I had stilettos on and it touched my ankle strap. I only wished it was longer given the event. I’d say buy your dress true size cause once you wrap it around, you won’t want it to look too small/tight."
4.0,Nice...a little tight fitting.
4.0,"I love these little LED finger lights!  At less than 25 cents each, these things are ridiculously cheap, but they're really bright and very cool looking.  I buy a 40-pack of these whenever I want some cheap toys to bring to a festival, rave, etc.  They are amazing for light shows for your friends and strangers, and giving them away is a great way to make people happy!<br /><br />In my experience, about 1/8 of these are broken straight of of the package, and another 1/8 run out of batteries within 90 minutes.  But that still leaves you with 30 that work fine and last for hours!"
4.0,Lighter than the picture
4.0,"So I got these today. I ordered a small and they sent an XS. I wasn’t thrilled as when I took them out of the package, my first thought honestly was that my 6 year old granddaughter could wear these. 😱<br /><br />Lo and behold- they fit me. Yes, the small would fit better. But these work and honestly are SO comfy. They are like butter. ❤️<br /><br />So smooth they are pretty sweet leggings. Feels like I’m not wearing anything - even with them being a bit on the tight side. Which is why I am still giving these a 4⭐️. Perhaps that is why they are pretty expensive leggings.<br /><br />Are any leggings worth $65? If there are any that are, these are them.<br /><br />They almost feel like compression hose. Are they supposed to? I don’t know, but I like it. Nice quality leggings for sure.<br /><br />The price is a bit high and they did send the incorrect size. I’m still kinda obsessed. 🤷‍♀️"
4.0,Purchased for my grandbaby it's a little big but hopefully she will grow into it by next summer price was great shipping took forever!!
4.0,"I did my research and saw that most snow pants run small. I’m usually a size 13-14 which would be a xl but I went to the store and tried on xl in snow pants and they didn’t fit, so I ordered a 2x and it fits good throughout but a little loose near the waist area; which is fine since I will be wearing leggings underneath. They are a bit on the longer side as well."
4.0,Very cute but I don’t care much for the hem around the bottom of the red patterned skirt. The other colors didn’t have that. Kind of gives off a cheaper look in my opinion but I don’t think anyone else noticed when I wore it.
4.0,So cute but it lost the windshield visor on one of my first rides and does not come with a replacement.
4.0,I liked them. Rhey all look good
4.0,I actually use this with a front pocket wallet.  The wallet is the perfect size for credit cards but getting the money in and out of a little pocket sucked.  I put this around the whole thing.  The carbon fiber looked cool on the black wallet and I can easily manage my money now.
4.0,"The only drawback is the size of the battery pack inside the mask.  It's shaped like a brick.  I wish they had used a flatter, wider design.  That being said, after a little pushing and adjusting, the mask sits on the face just fine.  Fun product."
4.0,"fits nice feels great, prone to snags so be careful around pokey things"
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:ec39829f063d5d885e2097ea377d4b1d]] I initially received a broken product right out of the packaging.  I while I was naturally disappointed, I reached out to the seller and they gave me a full refund within a week of initial purchase.  I would do business with this company again."
4.0,"I wear an XL but after 3 orders, I ended up with a 4XL that would fit.  The shirt is beautiful!!!"
4.0,"Looks good, leather softens, secure buckle.  Fixtures have been sound over 6 months at a manual labor (medium-duty) job."
4.0,"I ordered the rose gold but got a yellow gold. This is fine though. The stud was short and had a clear plastic back, I wore them all day. I kept checking on them. They were fine. They did seem smaller than the size ordered."
4.0,"It's shorter than I realized and that's coming from someone who is barely 5'2 inches tall. Fit-wise, the XL fit me with no problems. I typically wear a size 16/18. You can wear this alone or with some night pants. Found it to be soft and comfortable and looks good on!"
4.0,"This is a great blazer to tie your look together for a more professional or tailored style. The fabric doesn't feel expensive so 4 stars, but otherwise it's a cute style and look."
4.0,It's pretty just fits a little weird
4.0,"I like everything about them except that they are for a small face. I thought that because they were unisex they would be a little larger but no....they are more for a woman with a little face, that’s why I took off one star."
4.0,Grandson loves it. He just turned 7 and it fits his wrist on the tightest notch. Reviews for other watches said they ran too big for kids.
4.0,"I bought the blue/gray in size small which is the size I always use. I'm 5'0 and 100lb, dress fits as expected, just a little too long."
4.0,Top fits through the bust fine.  The length is longer than in the photo but looks great with the cardigan I'm planning to wear over it.
4.0,"Pretty, unique pattern; gives you a waist--a perfect &#34;teaching dress&#34; to look polished and yet feel comfortable. I do wish it were just an inch or so shorter (I am 5' 5&#34; and this hits a slight bit more below knee and so I may get it taken up to hit right at the knee or slightly above where it would look better.  There is some volume to the skirt, maybe a bit more swingy-ness than needed. But overall, a great value."
4.0,"I bought these for my son for college. He hasn’t used them yet, but they look just as the picture and fit fine."
4.0,Kinda tight width-wise; took some breaking in to make them feel comfortable
4.0,"Look homemade which is what we wanted...lined, soft...nice"
4.0,A little tight but hoping it stretching with age.  Sewing and material high quality.  It will meet my needs for a sun and fishing hat.
4.0,"This is a cute bag that is big enough for everyday use but small enough to wear crossbody or use when shopping or walking distances without feeling bulky. The color (luggage) is rich and can be used during all seasons. The long strap is a great length and 7 adjustment holes, which is fabulous and will accommodate most heights and figures. I gave this bag 4 stars because the strap is pretty thin and the pebbled leather feels a little stiff and rough. I’m sure this is to keep the bag structured, but it just caught me off guard. I was expecting a more soft and buttery feel. Maybe it’ll soften with time and use. Additionally, I think a thicker strap would be more comfortable when carrying the bag on your shoulder or cross body but the strap provided is tolerable. I’ve provided pictures for size reference. I am 5’4” and 130 lbs."
4.0,The scarface logo shown on Amazon is actually a lot bigger than the actual one on the cap. I was a little disappointed.
4.0,"I use it when i’m in the yard cleaning up,  it’s airy very light weight."
4.0,"This dress is is super cute and comfy. After reading reviews that it runs small i decided to order a medium (I'm 5'4'' and typically wear a small). The medium fits great, just like it looks like it would in the picture!"
4.0,Love the color. Fits everything I need it to. Fast shipping. Thanks!
4.0,Just bought wrong size expecting it to run small like most bathing suits.
4.0,They were a little tarnished when I received them . That's the reason for the 4 stars . Once polished the are perfect!
4.0,I would recommend one size larger
4.0,"Good dress but had obviously been used before, there were no tags on it and pulled out thread hanging from the waist. I decided to return it and get something else"
4.0,"Very soft and cute, but the bottoms are very small. Top is true to size, but shorts are little."
4.0,very pretty...just like the pic.
4.0,"I love the look, but it does feel tight across my foot."
4.0,Exact fit and very quality
4.0,Very comfortable.  The pair that these replaced were fairly &#34;clicky&#34; walking on our wood floors - these are much better.  They were a bit tighter than I expected but likely they need to be to wear in.
4.0,Thank you for getting the watch to me. I love it and am getting a lot of compliments on it.
4.0,It is great! I like the fabric and the way it fits. Even though it runs a little bit small.
4.0,I use this to take photos of my choker and I like the material.
4.0,"I liked the price and style,"
4.0,"The only negative I’d give this skirt is the waist band is very tiny and I had to return.  But will be ordering a L<br />I’m 5’9, 150 and wear a M consistently, however this skirt was more like a S.<br />Other than that, the color and pattern were beautiful.  It was lightweight and the perfect length for me."
4.0,"Great necklace for the price. I definitely wish it was a little longer, but that’s personal opinion. :)"
4.0,plan on buying more this spring.
4.0,The top fits perfect and the bottom is almost perfect. The only part that is a little tight is around the legs. And the back of the bottom isn't lined but awesome for the price!
4.0,"While ordering, I read a few reviews that said the shirt runs small. I normally wear a Medium in button down and t-shirts, so I ordered a Large. They accidentally shipped me an XL, but even that fits tight around my shoulders and isn't long down past my waist. I am ~42&#34; around the shoulders and am 5'10, 180lbs for reference. Anyone else ordering this shirt should keep this in mind and order a size or two larger than what they normally wear."
4.0,"Bought these for my homebirth. The picture looks better than the socks do in person. They are definitely compression socks. I didn't have an issue with them staying up, I just thought the material was a little weird and they looked a little different than the picture showed."
4.0,I bought the 3x plus size and while it fits it is very very tight.  I can only hook the very top and the very bottom hooks
4.0,Would purchase again. I am 36D and I have a lot of cleavage but cute
4.0,"A nice riding boot. I choose a half size larger than I normally wear, and they are snug with a heavy sock. They fit well with a light sock. The soles are potentially slippery,. I ride two different bikes and the one with rubber floor boards work very well. I was surprised when taking off on my bike with metal foot pegs as the boots slid right of them. The hard rubber soles are not good on all surfaces. Makes me question how they will be in the wet. I will be cautious."
4.0,"Looks beautiful, 1star off because the fabric is not that that great but decent for the price and I got many compliments."
4.0,"Amazing top, wish it was a bit larger"
4.0,"This blouse is SO very sheer! The wrists are elastic, but a bit tight, otherwise the short is very loose-fitting. MUST be worn over some sort of slip/under top."
4.0,Was ordered as a part of a halloween costume. Seems to be fine.
4.0,"Love the design, hate that I have to use a guitar pick or coin to open the thing. I was confused why I couldn’t open it with my hands. Then realized 30 mins later if the guitar pick was meant to open it"
4.0,"This is a great take on the traditional style of witch hats that you can purchase anywhere. This one is a knitted hat and looks almost “classy” if a witch could be classy! The curves give it character and it looks great dressed up with a decorative pin or brooch!<br /><br />The only issue is it is a bit snug… so if you plan to wear a wig underneath, you really need to pin it to the wig so it stays on and does ride up, and fall off, your head!"
4.0,"I keep an extra pair of sunglasses in the car in case there is glare off of other vehicles, and my last pair broke.  These sunglasses are fine.  They're a good classic style, they are not heavy, and the material is comfortable on my nose.  There are not quite as dark as I prefer, but they don't claim to be.  The pictures in the product description are all accurate.  The sunglasses come in a nice gift box, and the box includes a gift card, cleaning cloth, and keychain light; all good stuff."
4.0,"My son loves them!!!<br />He is often complemented on them. Wish they had more sizes, he is 4.5 and 5 fit just right, I'm afraid he may outgrow too soon. He got caught in the  rain and the shoes handled it well, still light up!"
4.0,This is a super cute dress. I ended up buying 2 more colors because they are so affordable. My only complaint is that the material looks wrinkled after washing. I hung it up to dry and even after being steamed there were crease lines.
4.0,My son ordered this for Halloween . Good quality material. He's ten and it fit him as well as adult.
4.0,I like them but some of the straps won't adjust.
4.0,I bought these for my 2 sons and they both complained from the leather straps rubbing on their little feet so I cut those out. Perfect now:) good slipper
4.0,Very comfortable. Beautiful in color.  Fits great.
4.0,Fabric is strange. Not really what I expected but very cute
4.0,I love these but they are a little tight but I have a wide foot and I think that is why
4.0,"Nice material, it was bigger than I expected but I just tied a knot in it on one side. It looked nice"
4.0,"This is a really cute dress.  I like that it has lining on the skirt portion.  The top of the dress is a slightly tight fit  I think they could make a pattern adjustment.  Also, I wanted black.  When you click on the black dress, it shows black in the description but the image is white and vice versa.  I chose the black description but I was shipped the white dress which was disappointing.  I never wear white."
4.0,Not the best quality… some came deformed. But most worked for what I needed them for
4.0,They did the job for me.  My skinny heels stayed on top of the grass at my son's outdoor wedding.
4.0,Could be a little larger.  I use a piece of plastic as a large apron underneath.  Patient has hasdvanced Parkinson's and eating gets really messy.
4.0,"I like it like it...I have been debating the purchase for some time. I love Mordenmiss but I was afraid of the sizing on this item. I am not small like the model, the body fits perfect and the length is great (I'm 5'8&#34;) but the bust is a little snug. I considered returning it because for the price I can get something else but I really like it. I am thinking to move the button over about .25 of an inch and it should be fine. I also wore a tank under it and left the top two buttons open. I really love the pockets. I already want another Mordenmiss dress but I worry about the sizing sometimes so it takes me awhile to press the trigger."
4.0,"This is really cute!!  I didn't know if I'd like the open shoulder thing, but I do.  I'd have to read the washing directions.  I would prob. wash in gentle."
4.0,It looks exactly like the photo. No unwanted surprises. Perfect for my girls weekend
4.0,"Nice looking watch for the value very pleased with it, second week having it."
4.0,Great color & space!  I have yet to use it on vacation but will soon and can return to write a full review.
4.0,"The pattern is nice, however it does see through a little - wear nude on the inside."
4.0,"Like it, it's good."
4.0,"My daughter loves the dinosaur pattern and it fits her well with some room to grow (she's a 70% percentile 5 year old).  Since the legs are long, it's not tight on her legs but that's fine.  I'm hoping it'll fit for a few years.  I love the fuller-coverage kids suits.<br /><br />I have no idea why the zipper is in the back though.  She can't get in and out of it herself, which is pretty annoying. Also, not a fan of the hat, so I gave it away."
4.0,I'm giving it a 4 because it's beautiful and I love it but it's alot smaller than I expected. I expected it to be bigger and wider. Still I wear pretty much everyday.
4.0,looks as advertised
4.0,I ordered 2 sizes up and it fits perfectly.
4.0,"This are a little bigger than I like, but cool glasses"
4.0,the material is thinner than it appeared but it's a nice dress
4.0,It's a bit shorter in sleeves and overall length than the pic implies.
4.0,"The bottoms fit me perfectly, but the top was way too big."
4.0,Loose fit lightweight summer shirt.
4.0,"I'm an airhead and didn't read the review so I had no idea how adorable this thing was going to be. My toddler is obsessed with animal hats so i got a variety of them from different sellers and this one is by far my favorite. I wish the antlers stuck up straight. They're completely stuffed/soft so they do kind of fall down, but the ears jumping when you squeeze the ""paw balls"" is hilarious and so cute. I wear this more than my son does now"
4.0,I loved the design it was what I wanted. The colors are great and made good.i am happy that I bought this body bag.
4.0,Small in scale and so adorable! Perfect stocking stuffer or small gift this holiday season. My 5 yr old dog loving girl is going to love this ring. I’m giving only 4 start b/c the adjustable ring band has some sharp edges. I will try to smooth them out. If it doesn’t work I’ll still keep the ring and try to glue the dog to a more kid friendly ring. I can tell you that I’m certain this ring my child’s favorite Xmas gift out of all the fun presents she receives this year.
4.0,"It’s fits and looks really cute, especially if you have a petticoat under the skirt. I am bustier so even in the recommended size it is tight on the chest. The zipper was a little hard to work so I needed someone to help me."
4.0,"Good quality, arrived safely."
4.0,It’s soooooo cute. But very thin material. I have to wear a pair of leggings underneath.
4.0,Nice shirt. Runs a little small
4.0,"This is cool enough that my middle schooler will actually wear it without complaining. It fits well and stays warm; however, the material is shinier than I expected."
4.0,"These are not as cute as the picture shown. All but one were tinted yellow, which I guess is common. I do love how small they are, perfect for my suit jackets. Also, they are not as blingly as I was hoping. Either way, because they're so tiny, I would buy from this seller again."
4.0,I love my Man purse. Its so practical and spacious.
4.0,"The posts are just a little bit soft, but other than that, they look nice. What was great about this set is that I wanted to keep two of my piercings open on my left ear. The piercings are close together, so I needed something that would work with a 5mm post. This set gave me a chance to experiment, and I ended up (surprisingly, to me) using the smallest of these, the 3mm, in conjunction with the 5mm post that I already had. They are still awfully close together, but the combination works. And they really do look nice, so they are definitely wearable, and the price cannot be beat."
4.0,Cutest leggings ever! They look so adorable on my 3 almost 4 year old and will fit her easily when she's 5.. if they last that long. Only complaint is that the holes are too big for the buttons so the come off easily. But very cute and very girly
4.0,Pretty bag. Just the right size.
4.0,Really soft and like the owl design a lot.
4.0,"ASUOAgio Women's Leopard Print Sweater Long Sleeve V Neck Knitted Sweaters Casual Knitted<br />Size Medium - I'm 5'6"" and 130 lbs. The medium fits me perfectly.<br /><br />This print is so much fun to wear! ROAR! Cute animal print that is perfect for a night out or a day at the office, or just relaxing at home. The sweater is soft, warm, and cozy! The neutral color looks great with dress slacks or jeans! I would recommend this sweater. 4 Stars! Hope you find this review and pictures helpful!"
4.0,These are my all time favorite sun glasses. The only thing that needs to be better is how the lenses are placed. Dropped them once and the lense popped out.
4.0,They are so warm ! I need more.
4.0,Not enough compression .
4.0,"very nice and well made, but a little on the large sode for a smaller face (mens)"
4.0,Looks good and material seems okay. Hasn't gotten warm enough to wear it yet nor have i washed it.
4.0,This dress is very cute. Casual dress as it's a t-shirt material but can be dressed up or dressed down.  The sleeves make the dress super cute.
4.0,"Use headbands for tennis and yard work.  These are nice and thick, mostly cotton.  Very absorbant, easy to wring out.  Like another reviewer said, they are a little on the tight side but just a little.  For all the other pros, I can live with breaking them in until they stretch out (like all my other ones always have until they are just to loose to stay on.)  Very worth the low price.  Ten is not enough.  Will buy more."
4.0,"I liked how warm but light it is.<br />Little short wish it was just a touch longer, but over all really like it."
4.0,Shorter than I anticipated but otherwise the are perfect.  Think mine was missing the pocket but I can live with out it….I guess…..check on me
4.0,"Very nice shorts if I may say so. However, they run extremely small. I am a size 4 and I got a medium and they will not fit me so now I have to send them back and get a large."
4.0,Fits great. The pads in the front are a bit low.  It smelled very musty and like mildew.  It took 2 washings to get it out.  Overall great suit for the price!
4.0,Fits I think I should have gotten the one plus size?
4.0,"I was nervous to buy this after reading the reviews, but it's just right for me. I'm a 36C, and it fits great. My main dislike is the quality. I'm pretty sure it won't last very long. The material is already unraveling in a few places, and I've only worn it once for a couple of hours. The material also isn't very soft when it rubs on the back of your neck after about an hour. I'm okay with that for the price, though."
4.0,They should have bagged the two chains separately.  It took time to untangle them.  I got mine to hold my key-chain.  It should work fine for that.
4.0,I like that it holds you in gently and that the straps are adjustable.  If I order again I'll order a large. This is made nicely
4.0,"This purse is exactly what I was looking for with the organizer handy on the outside for money, credit cards and zippered change pocket.  Absolutely no need for a wallet.  Multiple other pockets inside and out to keep everything in its place.  But the indigo blue is much darker than pictured.  It is so dark it's almost black.  Not what I was hoping for since I am replacing a black bag.  Wanted a prettier color for Spring."
4.0,"So cute, but wish it were a little smaller to fit in front pocket."
4.0,This is exactly the belt I was looking for and the item looked just as pictured. I only took off one star because the inner side of the belt had poor stitching done so the fabric at the end is coming off. I didn't return it because it's the inner part of the belt and doesn't show. Other then that I love the belt!
4.0,Went nicely with dress. Good buy for price.
4.0,"This bra was made for hot yoga, that being said it's good for light activity or exercise that doesn't jumble your upper half. I found its good for yoga, weightlifting, and biking I probably wouldn't run in this bra. But overall satisfied with the product cute and comfortable!"
4.0,"Fits well, looks great for a great price"
4.0,"They're not bad for anti-blue-light glasses. Pretty dark. When my normal glasses aren't doing enough to keep the blue light glare out of my eyes after hours of working, I pull these out as the big guns. They do a good job at relaxing my eyes, but they're so dark, I can't see the light of my glowing keyboard anymore."
4.0,"These clip-ons block the irritating sunlight (UV light) without being too dark, thus they improve vision acuity. I gave them 4 stars because I must take off my glasses to clip them on securely. But it's  worth the hassle!! Great function!!"
4.0,"Little small for my face ,could have been a little larger ,I still love it"
4.0,a bit gaudy but nice enough for a costume.
4.0,"I bought these to wear on th beach instead of my Maui Jim’s , to avoid scratching Maui Jim’s . When wearing I can telll the difference"
4.0,"The only thing I didn't like about this is that the pants seem to be see-through, It might just be me but it isn't ideal."
4.0,"These sunglasses are very nice. They are similar to my regular glasses so wonderful that I am able to read in the sunlight. Comfortable. If they came in colors, I would order more."
4.0,"I like its material, which is sturdy but light and thin. It holds your cards tightly and can store quite amount of cash. Did not test about the RFID blocking capability though. The capacity of cards is larger than I expected.<br />Unfortunately the height (Y in the product picture) is larger than my inner pocket of my jacket so it can only stay in the side pocket or back pocket on my pants."
4.0,Very nice loved it .
4.0,Bought as a gift and they're exactly as pictured. vibrant colors. Fun accessory
4.0,Wrinkle very easily.
4.0,Great trucker style shaped cap.  Vibrant colors in the pineapple against white white background.  Really good quality at this price.
4.0,I bought them for our vacation. You delivered early! Thanks. They fit and look fine. Going home soon and may need to buy something warmer.<br />:)
4.0,"Shirt size is just right, a little snug. As described, no issues. Thx"
4.0,"Great material, made solid, cute and great neutral color. Only problems are the Velcro area isn't long enough to close them small enough to stay on my son's wrists and the Velcro area was cut in a way that left very sharp edges that I had to trim myself."
4.0,"My husband got the fitbit blaze, for many reasons, a big one being that he could replace the band if needed. We decided to go ahead and order bands (to find the kind he prefers), extra chargers and screen protectors.<br />I personally love the feel of silicone (for the most part) so decided to try out this replacement band. We plan to get me upgraded to a blaze from my flex as well, so I figured why not even if he doesn't like it, we can use it for me and also have a back up.<br />So things he does like about this band:<br />The silicone is soft on the skin, does not rub or irritate and overall very comfortable, while feeling breathable<br />Keeps the blaze snug, yet not too tight or loose. And he said he could not see the blaze falling off while using this band.<br />The main thing he disliked, was that the band tucked back into itself. He found that part of this design annoying and ended up switching back to a different band due to it. Also the color (Teal) was not the choice he would of picked for himself.<br /><br />I received this product at a discounted or free price for my honest and unbiased review. I update my reviews if needed after I have used an item. All opinions of this review are my own, I am not required to give a good review unless I believe the product deserves it."
4.0,"Comes with two remotes with batteries included. Comes with two split USB cables to charge the shoes but no charging adapter included. Would've been five stars otherwise. The shoes are bright, easy, and fun for the kids to use. Lots of colors to choose from on the remote as well as different light modes."
4.0,"I got this in a size 4- my measurements are 35-27-38 and I'm 5'6&#34;. The 4 fit pretty perfectly, if not a teensy bit big at the waist. The fabric has some stretch to it and doesn't feel flimsy or cheap. The color is a beautiful emerald green, just like pictured. My only complaint is the clasps at the neck at the back are difficult to attach by yourself and the rings are fabric for metal hook loops.<br />Other than that, this will be perfect for our pin-up picnic photo shoot!"
4.0,"The quality is good but not great, there were a few stray stings that I had to cut when I received it.  Having said that the amount of quality for the price is fantastic. If you are even toying with the idea of wearing a real bow tie instead of a clip on you'd be foolish not to buy this.  The compliments you will get on wearing a real bow tie to an black tie event completely justify the purchase."
4.0,"I was happily surprised by this T-shirt.  It has a texture and look of silk, even though it is cotton.  It is dressy enough to wear with a suit, but goes equally as well with jeans.  It runs generous in cut and length.<br /><br />I hand washed it, so I don't know yet how it will hold up in a washing machine."
4.0,The watch is a gift for my sister<br />Found out she can better tell time with numbers<br />It is very pretty
4.0,Size is good. Not too small.
4.0,"These are cute.  The picture on the shirt is large and a little stiff, which would bother me, but my 4yo is just so happy to have princesses that it doesn't faze her."
4.0,"Nice style, design and fabric, but it runs small,  it is not an oversize dress, I bought the dress hoping its would look like an dramatic oversize looking top, well it not."
4.0,I like it.  Straps is a little short.
4.0,"A beautiful amulet! Unfortunately mine came with a small crack at the bottom, and the bottom Hebrew character is mildly scratched off."
4.0,Would maybe buy a size up. Fits well every wear expect the crotch is a little tight
4.0,The bracket is light weight and doesn't take up a lot of space but in a fitted mask it does not stay in place well.  The mask constantly falls down below the top of the bracket after you have had it on for a while.  In a pleated mask it seems to stay in place a bit better but I'm still not sure I am sold on them.
4.0,This is a good looking bracelet. The silver is plastic but it still looks good and wears well. It's probably not for wearing everyday but as a unique piece for the occasional night out its perfect. For the money it's a great bracelet and the vendor was prompt and the product was well packaged!
4.0,"I was disappointed that the style I ordered was not matching the photo. But so far the product has delivered and been good on my long runs training for a 1/2 marathon. I have another hat at half the price which has already fallen apart at the seam. THe company said they would offer a refund, when initially I thought the product was from them (both the hats I ordered look similiar) I will update if there are any issues."
4.0,"After reading all the reviews I decided to order 1 size up. ( I normally wear S ). I'm 5'4, 110 Lbs. However, it is way too large and long. It's M but fits like L. Have to return it. Overall, the color is very cute and material is good."
4.0,"Cute glasses for the price.  Scratch very easily, but they work for a quick throw away pair.  Not for long term use.  Also, do not expect the sun to be blocked."
4.0,I like the dress and the lace but I didn't like the skirt material
4.0,Cool shoes and everyone at the dance studio agrees. Bit pricey.
4.0,Love this dress! It has lots of stretch too!
4.0,"Much larger than I originally imagined but still well made for a $14 pair of sunglasses (totally ignored the dimensions posted). The supposedly brown glass tint is actually a very shiny GOLD rather than the muted brown in the photo (hence the 4 stars). The case is awesome. Seemingly sturdy and hard, with a strong magnet to hold it closed. Very unexpected for the cost (half expecting a cloth baggie). The cleaning cloth is a more coarse than I'd use but nothing a few times through the wash wouldn't solve. I have a terrible streak with sunglasses so hopefully they'll last longer with this case."
4.0,"The horns are rather heavy for the headband, so it kept slipping or completely falling off throughout the night. Other than that, these are some quality horns and I’m rather happy with them."
4.0,"A nice basic dress. I'll be wearing it to a funeral service next week, but plan on wearing it to work as well. It's stretchy material, but not too thin. I love the length, it hits just below my knee."
4.0,"Lightweight and comfortable!  This top is TTS. If you like your shirt loose, I would order up a size."
4.0,When I saw these Baby Newborn Infant Girls PU Leather Socks Sandals Toddler Shoes Prewalkers I was in love. I couldn't wait to get these and try them out on my little girl. They looked so adorable and I loved the open toed look along with the hard soles. I also loved that I was able to choose from a few different color options. They did take a little bit longer to arrive since prime shipping was not an option and they were coming from another country but that wasn't a huge issue for me. The shoes looked exactly as pictured and I was very happy with them. the little fringes are a cute little touch. The only issue that I found with these shoes was that they were a little wider then I think they should be. Other than that thought I was very happy with this product. I will definitely be recommending these Baby Newborn Infant Girls PU Leather Socks Sandals Toddler Shoes Prewalkers to my family and friends. I bought this product at a discounted price in order to leave my honest and unbiased review.
4.0,"Looks sweet, just leaves little indents on the sides of the bridge of your nose. They shine like aviators."
4.0,So comfortable. Beautiful colors.  I thought it had more of a V neck and the slit was higher than I expected but I still like it a lot.  I was pleased with my purchase.
4.0,The product was thin and seem to shrink a little after washing !!
4.0,Fits well and she loves it
4.0,Love these jammies but they were snagging after one wear.
4.0,"As much as I love this dress and the style of it it sure would’ve been nice if it had button all the way up. Is a fake panel and they did not tell her potential customer that it was not truly a button up it just had buttons on it. I was looking for a few garments that would actually button up because of a broken arm. The only reason I kept it was because it was stretchy and my husband was able to help me on and off with it but it would’ve been a lot nicer had it been listed exactly the way it was. Please correct your description so people know exactly what they’re getting, and you will get less returns"
4.0,"My Grandson loves anything, and everything Cars.  Decided at the last minute to get this 2-piece pajama set for him.  He wears a 4T and the closest size was a 4...I took a chance and ordered it.<br />Overall, they fit as expected.  The top fits great however, the pants are long.  As a result, he doesn't wear them, only the top...Which is fine with me...He loves it.<br />Highly recommended for sure!"
4.0,"These were cute and comfortable, good fit also. Ended up with a couple holes after two days at in indoor Waterpark, but over all they worked well for the price. They would probably hold up much better at a beach."
4.0,Sad the print (Black splatter) was only on the front but looks great print perfect
4.0,The fit is very form fitting and can be unforgiving.  But the dress is an eye catcher for sure. A very classy look with a bit of edge.
4.0,"I'm a size 12-14, and on the tall side, and an XL fits me perfectly, Hugs the curves but not too tight.  Worn it twice, and have gotten several compliments, so I think it looks good on me."
4.0,Dress up party accessory!
4.0,Cute and fun shirt. True to size!
4.0,"This bracelet is great, however it fits 4 different width watches with proper pin-bars. It is advertised as 4 different length pins and a Jeweler""s Tool, included. None if them were included. So I had to go to a Local Jeweler to have this installed and pay an extra $5.00.<br />In my case it could have been worse. The width of pins were OK."
4.0,"Beautiful watch! It could have been described better, it is very large with a convex crystal on the face. However if you don't mind a large watch thus one is absolutely gorgeous."
4.0,"Super cute but super seethrough!! Expected this with white pants, sadly I returned them due to this."
4.0,"The socks are great! I exhibited at a home show for three days wearing them. They really helped. The only thing is, if your feet are on the larger side, after washing them once, they shrunk and were harder to put on my feet. That won't keep me from wearing them, unless they continue to shrink."
4.0,"Have not used it but it did arrive quickly and is well made. I like that I have ample room for money, passport, other I.D. and is adjustable."
4.0,This set of glasses is great.  I can see better with them and having 3 pair allows me to have a set wherever I am in the house or school or work......that is if I can stop forgetting they're on my head and then collecting them all in one place!  I would have given these 5 stars except for the fact that they are a @#% to clean.  They smudge easily and require constant cleaning.
4.0,"very nice hat, a little small,that's the only thing that I regret, but it looks very nice."
4.0,Cute and comfy.  Fits smaller so size up.
4.0,"I think it's very cute. Only a couple things I would change. The top is not very supportive. I think I'm finally at the aid that I need an underwire swimsuit. The straps are adjustable but I already tightened them up.<br />The bottoms are cute, again just wishing I had more rump for the rear. The pattern on the bottoms is great! I love the color combo of this suit."
4.0,Bought this for my husband. He really likes it but the sleeve had some wear on it. I gave it to him for his birthday so it was over the return window so we kept it.
4.0,"Works well, but requires upkeep overtime. Hang it up, don't ball it up!"
4.0,"Great pair of goggles! These are nice durable, high quality goggles.  They come with nose plug and a nice case to keep them in. I liked how they clip in the back and that its easy to change the size of the straps. My husband used them, and then my 5 year old daughter wanted to try them. They worked great for both my husband and my 5 year old daughter. Great product! I'm happy to have goggles to last all summer long! They are very comfortable to wear and they look great on. I love the easy release clasp for the strap it is not one long strap  pulls on my hair out and when you adjust the straps to your length they lock into place to insure no slippage.  I found them easily adjustable so never too tight or loose and soft comfortable lining is gentle on the face. You get a great suction around you eyes which means there is no leaking water. The goggles are light weight and have a flexible nose band. The lenses are UV protective and fog free for a nice clear view under and above water. The nose clip is extra padded and secure fitting and the ear plugs were comfortable and did a good job. I think that they are great value for the money. Even the carry case is quality with a twist to close feature so you can avoid scratches.I received this product at a discount for my honest, unbiased review. In no way does this effect or influence my review of the product. If at any time I find the product does not live up to the initial review, I will edit/update my reviews. If these comments were helpful to you please click the yes button."
4.0,"This belt was very cute. I was not able to make a bow in the front, with the straps, but I made one in the back and it was just as cute."
4.0,Gave as a gift. Not much space in this bag but it seemed to go over well.
4.0,"I only give this a 4/5 because a few rings fell off when I first opened the package, but it was an easy fix with a pair of pliers. Overall, the chains were heavy and were great quality. It looked very beautiful on."
4.0,This is a pretty good gaiter.  The material is soft and breathable.  It does fit a little snug and does not have a lot of give.  Thus it feels like it will slide down at times.  I have a bigger head and think this gaiter is more suited for those same as me.  Recommend.
4.0,Pretty band. I should have measured my wrist first as when it arrived it was very snug. I thought about returning it but was able to unclamp the ends that attach to the Fitbit and slightly lengthen each band. It makes a nice change from the other silicon bands I usually wear!
4.0,The material quality great!
4.0,Use the Size Information from the Description and the dress will fit right.  The only thing I did not like about the dress was that the button for the keyhole neck is black (ordered Navy Blue). I would have given this 5 stars if the button matched the top of the dress.  I have yet to wash the dress and I will edit my review if I have a bad experience in doing so.
4.0,"I get many, many compliments with this purse. However, a handle has already broken and I haven't even owned it that long 😔"
4.0,"I got this slip dress to wear under a crochet dress I made.  I was going to make a slip but could not find fabric the color I wanted. I got this in the cocoa color which is a nice neutral pale brown sort of like coffee with cream. For reference I am 5'6&#34; and weigh about 114, 32/24/37 and I got this in the Medium. I didn't want it super tight or baggy either. The medium fits through the bustline, is a little loose through the waist and is pretty snug over the hips (a little snugger than I wanted, but it is workable under the dress). It is a little loose under the arms, but not anything major and you can't tell under the dress I wear it with.  It washed nicely but looked like it was very twisted at first, the side seam was twisted toward the front, however after it dried completely it straightened out again. The fabric is soft and stretchy. This fell below my knee, pretty much like on the model, but I wanted it shorter so I shortened it to above the knee."
4.0,It's a bit baggy for a small. But nice shirt and great color.
4.0,"I bought the black/black and pink/gold double set. They look like the pictures but I am definitely disappointed. They aren't &#34;oversized&#34; like they appear,  just average sized glasses. They are definitely cheap and light weight. Both pairs for slightly differently. Sharp looking just not quality. They arrived timely."
4.0,Very pleased with the quality of boot and fit. I am giving 4 stars as time took a while to receive- ordered as prime.
4.0,"Nice shorts that fit well and a good price.  Lightweight, perfect for the hot summer."
4.0,"I love these earrings,  the post is comfortable & Crystal's are beautiful,  I've had several compliments already,  only thing is 1 crystal fell out about a week later"
4.0,"comfortable, but did not stay up like other compression socks I have"
4.0,"These socks aren't as thick as I expected but that might turn out to be a good thing considering how heavy my hiking boots are. The colors are great and the cushions are comfy! Definitely a great buy, especially for the price."
4.0,The.gift was for my brother and he love it. He a big patriots fan and use the clip everyday. I can't wait to buy more nfl stuff.
4.0,I usually wear medium but I ordered the large for extra length. It's still a bit short but quite comfortable. Very soft and I love the colour.
4.0,Cut hat but don't know why they added the green little pipe cleaner fuzzy things in net. I removed them and it looks better without.
4.0,I love this top. The only problem I have with it is the top part of the shirt is definitely too small. The rest of the shirt fits great. I love the look of it if only I can get the top part to fit better.
4.0,"I like the purse. However, I wish the outside pocket that has the snap was deeper. I currently have a Stone Mountain purse that looks very much like this. I use the pocket with the cover to put my IPhone 5 in but this new purse does not accommodate the IPhone. It sticks out and I can't snap it shut."
4.0,The skirt runs very large.
4.0,I get complemented all the time in this shirt. Its a bit long but i think its supposed to be. Nicely made. Beautiful design. 👍👍
4.0,Small nice looking pocket watch. Trick is getting it to open.
4.0,I liked the earings....bought for my helix piercing at the top of my left ear. Although it's much larger than it looks in the picture. It caught in my hair so I'm only wearing it on occasion now. Wanted something I could put in and leave.
4.0,"I like this item, the color is just as described and it fits well.  I haven't washed it yet thought, will update if it falls apart!"
4.0,Love this dress and the fit was just right highly recommend
4.0,"So pretty, but so snug.  I like my sweaters loose.  I usually wear a large.  I ordered the 3X.  The sleeves are so snug, it wont allow me to wear all of my thicker long sleeve shirts with it. But it is a beautiful sweater and even knowing this- I ordered 3 more colors. Thus, the 4 stars for simply not being sized for adults."
4.0,These lenses were easy to install into the frames and look good. They are acrylic and not glass however and I am a little concerned to see how they hold up but so far so good.
4.0,I bought size 11/12 and they're a little big on my 4 year old granddaughter who wears size 11 shoe. Also these are made on the wider side. We'll be keeping these.
4.0,Material is nice & soft. It's very long. I love the color- I got royal blue. I would give it 5 stars if it had pockets.
4.0,Fits as expected to fit. Sort of like a spanx fit. Or tights.
4.0,The length is kinda short
4.0,"Will not fit medium to large adults. Resin shell suitable for teens and younger.<br /><br />*message from the seller below.<br />Dear Ricky,<br /> This helmet uses a button cell #2032. If you need any help, please feel free to contact me.<br />Thank you for your cooperation.<br />Best regards installation."
4.0,It fits well but the material is a bit thinner than I expected. Other than that it is a great product
4.0,Adds a little flash to the wrist and appears to hold up so far.  No discoloration no trouble with the clasp.  I would recommend this for those looking for a simple bracelet..
4.0,I can wear them with any casual shoe or boot.
4.0,These panties fit pretty good.  I was hesitant to order them because every time I order Bali Comfort Revolution Microfiber Hi Cut they run different.  I always order 10/11 and honestly several times in the past they looked like a size 8.  Others have said it makes a difference which country they were manufactured in.  Also sometimes the Model # is listed 303J/AK83?  I'm just happy these were great.  I gave it 4 stars because the perforated pink swirl did run smaller.
4.0,Very comfortable leggings (I haven't put it through a wash yet).  I gave 4-stars because the colors are not like the picture.  I ordered two and both looked better in the pictures but it's a good price and I will purchase again.
4.0,"Cute boot. I ordered my normal size 8 and they are a bit big. I have many Koolaburra by Ugg and Ugg boots and the sizing of the pair I recieved seems to be off a bit. They fit loosely. I haven't decided to return them or keep them. I never wear my Uggs with socks because they are so warm, but I'll have to if I keep them.<br />The style is very cute and I like the height of them."
4.0,It's solid and sturdy. Nice colors. A little larger than I expected but that was a plus.
4.0,"very pretty, very realistic"
4.0,Great ring set. light. dont even know that they are there on your hand.  THESE ARE TWO PIECE rings. Just fyi.
4.0,"If you are a small person with implants it will be hard to get the top to fit right. It gave me a lot of side boob. I am 5'5, 135 pounds and a 32 DD so I ordered a medium. The bottoms fit great, but the top is a little small. I will still wear it lounging around my pool but not to public places."
4.0,"They're really cute, a little on the thin side, but they fit fine on my big thighs"
4.0,"I absolutely love this bracelet. It's perfect, it's adjustable and I always get complimented on it. Definitely will be buy more!"
4.0,"The ONLY thing keeping me from giving this 5 stars is that it was delivered rolled up.<br /><br />I'm a big dude (6', 230lbs.) and it works for me size-wise. Considering the cost, it was pretty well-made and looks great.<br /><br />When I initially got the shield, though, it was rolled up tightly. When I pulled it out of the wrapping  the shield was practically in a circle shape so I had to put it under my Bowflex for a few hours at a time. The problem with this is that not only did it straighten it, but it also flattened it as well. What could have been a pretty great 3d shield is now essentially a thin 2d shield.<br /><br />Other than the shipping method I'm VERY happy with it."
4.0,Bought these for my 5 years old who loves to run! Holding up well so far. I like that there's no velcro to wear out.
4.0,Very cute but material of straps are very veryy cheap still love them just beware of the cheap material.  So far though they are oretty durable
4.0,Bought for my grandchildren to keep sunglasses on when boating.
4.0,"I'll start by saying, definitely wear shorts or something underneath this as it tend to blow open if you're out in the wind at all. The fabric also has no stretch at all, so if you're broad shouldered (like me), it can feel a little tight. Overall, decent dress for a really low cost. I got a size small, weigh 125lbs and an 5'5"""
4.0,What's the point? They only fit the glasses that come with it.
4.0,"These are a little large for newborn size, so I’ll have to wait a while to use them. Cute neutral colors."
4.0,"Good fit. The material was different than expected. It is more silky, no structure."
4.0,These seem much nicer than they are given the fancy packaging. The reality is that they're just a cheap pair of Chinese sunglasses that probably cost about .50 cents to make. Not bad for $11 bucks though.
4.0,They were very cute but I had to go online and figure the shoe size in US format which I did but still got the wrong shoe size...I thought I put 22 but apparently I didnt.  I gave them to my niece as a Christmas present instead of my daughter.
4.0,"I love the length, wish it had more splits on the side"
4.0,"Bought these for my mom for Christmas. Much smaller than I thought they would be, but still beautiful. She will love them."
4.0,It’s a cute dress and fits true to size. I washed on gentle and hung to dry as instructed. I just wish it was more of a tshirt dress that could be washed and dried normally. Not a huge deal but I have 3 kids so special loads of laundry tend to get put on the back burner! Lol
4.0,It fit perfectly & is good quality.
4.0,I really like this dress! It's true to size and have stretch which is nice.the one thing I would like to say it is a bit longer than the picture suggest or maybe it's just because I'm a bit short.  overall love it and I'm even thinking of buying it and black
4.0,"I got the KOSY KOMFORF low cut socks for my husband. He had a Stroke so one hand doesn't work, as well. He discovered low cut socks are easier to put on. He says they actually feel better, too.  The socks are well made. I wash them in cold water and dry in low heat. I don't want to risk shrinking them.  His socks stay on with shoes, but the back of his ankle and foot is straight, so the socks pop off with no shoes. I tried them, too. They stay on my feet with and without shoes."
4.0,"I like the shirt but, didn’t realize it was a stretchy synthetic material. Would rather have had it mostly cotton (that’s the reason I didn’t rate it 5 stars). The glow in the dark print is great; really bright in the dark."
4.0,"Very nice bracelet.  It just didn't look nice on my arm.  I recently gained some weight and I think you have to have very slim wrists to wear this.  It just didn't look or feel right.  So disappointed.  Otherwise, beautiful."
4.0,It’s pretty... looks ok
4.0,"This is a very pretty wig and feels soft to the touch.  It's a little smaller than expected in terms of the head piece.  The color is great.  I didn't try to cut or heat style it because I didn't need to.  It has nice curls at the end and the bangs were the right length for my face.  Note that I bought this wig for a one-off wig party, so I don't know how it would hold up with regular use.  If anyone intends to use it more than once, I can't speak the appropriateness of that use."
4.0,"It was exactly as expected. You get what you pay for, I did get a crack on the frame but they haven’t completely broken so I’m content"
4.0,Beautiful bracelet at a great price. Wish it were could go a bit smaller as it slides around my wrist too much.
4.0,I wear this all the time.  It's so comfy.
4.0,NOT POLARIZED! They even include a polarized rest image and none of the lenses are polarized.<br /><br />But... besides that it is a great deal for the price. Can't go wrong really at price. Come in a nice case too.
4.0,"The belt was a little hard to figure out, material is a little thin. However, it is a really cute dress"
4.0,Legs fit tight but everything else seemed loose. We will know better after washing. One girl liked the colors my other didn't like them
4.0,greet!
4.0,This is a cute swimsuit cover up. Fabric tag says it is 95% polyester and 5% spandex but the dress itself does not stretch so the spandex is in the crochet sleeves and edging. There is a nice applique on the front of the cover up with pom pom trim on the sleeve edges and bottom hem. The fabric is pretty thin and see through - typical of many cover ups - so this isn't something that would work to go from beach to a bar for drinks - at least not for me. But around a pool and in hot and humid weather this covers you up in something light and breezy. This would also work on a cruise - it certainly would be light to pack.
4.0,The charger and the on button is in an awkward place.  It hurts to wear for any length of time.  We had to place a piece of fabric over it but she loves them!
4.0,"I like the style, fit and look; but not sure how to clean them and maintain the look."
4.0,"I like it a lot, Just like the Les Paul I know. I have it hanging on the mirror of my truck, and it looks great!"
4.0,Serves its purpose and stays on your head at night...good quality
4.0,It is as it says a large. However I've worn other shirts that were large and they were a &#34;loosely&#34; large fit if that makes sense. I am very happy with it I only plan to wear on occasion. When ordering this line order 1 size higher than you wear for comfort. Design is beautiful and i will continue to order theseshirts!
4.0,Good product as advetised
4.0,"The clasps aren't really secure, but the overall look of the earring is very nice."
4.0,"Good design, a bit lightweight and the UV coating is not very hardy."
4.0,"I really love these flats! They are super cute, fit very well, and have a great variety of colors. The only issue I've had with them is that I've only worn them twice and they are already showing wear. For the price and the level of cuteness... it's worth it! :)"
4.0,Nice bag. Not as big as illustrated. When I received it and took it out of the bag I was so surprised how small it was but it is a cute bag.
4.0,"I purchased this in blue. As stated in previous reviews, the bag is a bit darker more vibrant than the photographs. I wish the sellers would update this listing. The navy blue is actually quite beautiful. I'm contemplating purchasing the red, but I'd like to see more buyer photos.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- The outer fabric doesn't feel as soft as I had hoped...but then again, it's vegan leather and not real leather.<br />- The zipper pulls and little side leather pulls are quite loud. I took a pair of scissors to the side pieces. Much improved! I might replace the front zipper pulls.<br />- The two diagonal front pockets are a bit useless. They're spacious, but easy targets for pickpockets.<br />- The regular straps aren't removable and don't tuck in to the bag when you attach the longer strap.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- This bag looks high end with great details.<br />- The inner pockets are reinforced with small strips of the outer shell material.<br />- The two separate major compartments are WONDERFUL for sorting out my day to day and work stuff.<br />- The back outer pocket is great for quick items like my phone and lip gloss.<br />- The straps are a great length<br />- My 13-inch macbook pro actually fits inside! It's not a great fit, but I totally didn't expect I could squeeze it in."
4.0,These were great for vacation and hid my tummy when I tucked the front into my shorts. Beware that they will shrink A LOT so best to air dry them which is why I gave one less star. Perfect to wear as is or to use with iron on projects. I ordered a large and it fit me well. 5'5&#34; and 170 lbs.
4.0,First time I ever worn this and I like it had to find the right adjustment but it's good for what I want to keep my shirts tucked in and looking right.
4.0,"I received this outfit in the royal blue color and it was very nice; really rich in color and vibrant. It definitely catches the eyes and accents someone with brown or green eyes.  The material feels amazing to the skin and is very stretchy; it has a polyester feel. It is 95% polyester and 5% spandex. I'm 5'2 and the legs of the outfit are very long so I am going to have to cut and add a hem. It's a one piece outfit and it comes with a brown belt (not that dark brown), and the open in the front (maybe because I'm short) doesn't sit too low. I see myself accenting with some sandals or heels, either or will benefit this outfit.  The threading was intact and I didn't see any loose threading or holes. I stretched it pretty good to see if it was easy to rip or damage and it didn't. My only dislike is that it displays everything!! You can see your panty line unless you wear a thong. If you're a thick chick then it will show all the dents, curves, and rolls, so be sure to wear something that hides or covers those areas. Overall good product!<br />I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review."
4.0,Everyone loved them. Totally completed my costume! Except I thought they were only going up to my thigh these are a complete pair of hosiery. I’m short so they did go up extremely high but nothing I’m not used to. I thought the bats looked a little funny but in the picture I think they look fine. Only disappointed that they were thigh highs other than that super fun.
4.0,Liked fit and colors.<br />Not material as much
4.0,"Good deal for the money; however, the tie backs are very short.....like the apron was for a child."
4.0,These sun glasses are super cute but they are still a little wide for my face.
4.0,Its ok it decent .gotta fix this one up too .it doesnt look like the pic too much .id give it a 4 to b nice
4.0,Super cute!  I get lots of compliments on it ;)
4.0,I was looking for a white and black dress. I received a colored dress with different flowers
4.0,Slips up constantly but oh well
4.0,"The top of this dress wasn’t as soft and flexible as I expected it to be, but overall it is beautiful and I got sooooo many compliments in it. Everyone said I looked like a mermaid the way the color changes in the skirt half."
4.0,"it's beautiful but the way that this cloth is cut and sewed is not quite as the same way as a real hanfu should be made. overall, it's nice. looks unique wearing it when I hanging out."
4.0,"Very cute dress. I received the silver dress, not the black dress, due to a shipping error. Even so, I love the silver dress."
4.0,"Very nice for a special occasion.  Please note that the bag is covered in crystals, not rhinestones so the high sparkle is not there"
4.0,"I like the way it fits me. As expected, it's too plain and made of cheap very thin materials. I bought this to wear to a casual destination wedding, but I think I'm going to get another dress."
4.0,my daughter loves these boots
4.0,"REVIEWING: Women’s Corset Briefs and Corset | Body Shaper / Waist Trainer for Women<br />*<br />*<br />I ordered the grey with hooks. [It does have the straps as well. I just wanted to show the rows of hooks since I haven't seen them in any photos here]. My waist fluctuates between 30in-32in, so I chose the Med (based on the stock chart). It fits comfortably & exact, which I don't think it's supposed to?<br />The 3rd row barely feels any tighter than the 1st row. I think I probably should have a small with buckles so it fits more snug & can tighten as my waist shrinks.<br /><br />Other than that it is good quality."
4.0,It’s lovely - the only reason I wouldn’t give it a perfect score is because it’s not as long as other scarves I have and I prefer the longer length.
4.0,Good product for reasonable price
4.0,They are ok just had to shorten them  I don't like them as well as some of Joe Boxer's I got last year. Great cold weather gear.
4.0,"Updated again- even though they changed the inside… I kept it… and fell in love it with all over again.. the only reason not 5 stars is cause of the inside not being the same quality as it originally was… but love love this bag! So many pockets.. the front pocket actually holds a lot of stuff.. and I am getting ready to buy another one- This will be my third one! ❤️<br />Updated…I bought another one of these backpacks but they have now remade this and now the inside is made of plastic like material and very cheap!<br />I am so disappointed, pockets inside are now cheap and will rip if you really want to use them!<br />********<br />Fun and great backpack! The pockets inside are very nice and great quality! Perfect size!"
4.0,very nice...same as shown in the picture.
4.0,"Fits great, color is true to picture. But the material is suuuper thin."
4.0,"Very cute. Love the fabric. White top is definitely see-through, and only white lace in the back! Needs a camisole or tank top underneath."
4.0,"Everyone who takes a look is like &#34;NICE!!!&#34;<br />It fits a bit loose but it's not terrible because my wrist is a bit chunkier than most. If your wrist is thin, don't do it, doesn't look like it can be resized."
4.0,"Beautiful color and texture. Just need to make sure I plan when I wear them--I try not to wear them with makeup on because they're velvety. Also, I try to wear them on mild days so they won't get oily. That said, they're sort of higher maintenance than I am, but they're fun as a secondary pair :)"
4.0,It is comfortable.  I forget I am wearing it.  I like the color.
4.0,"was a great purchase, really this product is excellent in color, size, quality, i recommend it."
4.0,very pretty and arrived on time
4.0,5’5” 155lbs. I ordered large for a little extra room because I don’t like a tight fit. It’s huge. I still love it for around the house but could have gone at least a size smaller for a better fit.
4.0,The secrid twin wallet leather in vintage blue is a great product. This review is short term review so I can't comment on how durable the wallet will last until I am about a year or two in. I can tell you off the bat that the mechanism to push the cards out work smoothly IF you do not over whelm the card holders. I am able to fit 5 raised letter cards in the first card holder and about 6-8 non-raised letter cards in the secondary card holder. It is a neat contraption for a wallet and gets people sparking interest when you pull it out to pay for a item. The wallet does NOT hold ALOT of money well. It really designed for people who carry a good amount of cards. You can put about 4 to 5 one hundred dollar bills but other than get a money clip for your money. The leather seems to be holding up fine and fits comfortable in my front pocket with jeans. I would give it 5 stars if it could hold more money.
4.0,I bought this dress for my husbands birthday. It hits my mid thigh. I think it is a lovely dress. You need a backless bra. My only negative is that the back lace was loose and needed to be pinned down which is a minor inconvenience for a beautiful dress. Little cleavage revealing but that’s all good for a night out with the hubby.
4.0,These are very uncomfortable.  Great value and quality though
4.0,Love this shirt~
4.0,I love this inflatable. The only issue with it is that the bottom is not flat and it doesn't stand up by itself. We had to tape it to the table. Minor problem. Looked great. Great value for money.
4.0,"Great product to buy, i never had one B4 so i use it for prayer"
4.0,This is a fabulous skirt ! Fits great but it was supposed to be like a purple or magenta and it’s actually pink. My phones kinda crappy but it’s like a carnation pink. Customer service was great in rectifying the problem
4.0,"I purchase this dress for a formal event, have not worn it yet but it fits perfectly.  I can't wait."
4.0,A bit larger than I expected (size of a dime) but still very cute!
4.0,"I returned 2 pairs of shorts to Kohl’s store in Grandville,Michigan on Tuesday 7/19 but it looks like 1 pair did not get registered. They ran really short."
4.0,Hits to high on the waist. I like sweats to be below the belly button. These ride up and give a weird look. Around the house pants. I am small and don’t like clothes that make me feel fat due to bad fit.
4.0,He will grow into them...
4.0,"Great bathing suit for my teen. She loves it,  and it looks adorable on her!"
4.0,The teal jacket is not as bright and vibrant as the picture.  Color is a lighter grayish teal color. I kept it because it is a really nice<br />Jacket
4.0,"nice quality, good weight. its a great beater for the money"
4.0,Cute. Puffy. Well made. Lined so it's not itchy. I would buy it again in a second.
4.0,I purchase these sterling silver studs to replace a set where I had lost one of the two. These are true sterling silver. They arrived in a cute bag packed in a box with a sterling silver cleaning cloth. I have had them in since they arrived and love them!
4.0,"I really like this dress, the only thing I don't like is that the sleeves are a bit tight but that's on me. My hands are not skinny"
4.0,Feels very nice but a bit smaller than expected.  Will move the belt straps down and then it should fit how I like it.
4.0,"Item fit my gf great at first, however only plan on wearing it a few times, item stretches out after a few uses."
4.0,Absolutely love the pockets and the dress being wrinkle free. had difficulty finding a bra to work with it.
4.0,"I initially rated 3 star for this item as the eye shield is so blurry, then I stated checking the film I realized that there is 2  film covering the shield  that once u remove that u can start to see much clearer. Glad I did not return it."
4.0,Love the belts. They fit great. I would definitely buy again.
4.0,"I have only tried this on so far, so I can't speak to longevity, but this dress is CUTE and comfortable! I ordered a size up just in case, because, well Amazon. And while it is a bit big, the fit still looks nice and like it is meant to be a bit oversized. Paired with some black tights and combat boots, this dress is a perfect cold weather date night dress! It is heavy though, so that's why I say cold weather - this thing would make me SWEAT if I wore it and the temps were above 70. It's definitely a winner though!"
4.0,The socks are what I expected and are very comfortable.<br /><br />4 Star
4.0,Like band but catches on material some times.
4.0,Great price and great set.  I only gave it 4 stars because I struggled with teeny tiny ball closures on all of the earrings besides the industrials which had larger ball closures.
4.0,I liked how It came with the tool kit to make it your preferable size but it is somewhat lose and wobbly
4.0,Loveeee this. I got this in another color too because I loved the style so much! Only unfortunate thing is that they get loose...so you have to readjust them. So if you’re out walking around they tend to hike up and get loose on the waist. Making me have to basically take it off and realign and adjust it....a little risky if you're not just wearing your swim suit underneath lol.
4.0,The style and color are very nice. I like this shirt.
4.0,"A true PLUS SIZE robe!!! Bought these for my wedding for me, my maid of honor and a mini for my daughter to get ready in. They’re super soft and super roomy! I’m a W16 in pants & it’s so roomy and actually long enough to be comfortable in without any “mishaps”. Plus you can’t beat the price! Not crazy about the material but the design is high quality and it looks like it will photograph well. 9/10"
4.0,Nice bracelet chains. Perfect for what I needed
4.0,Way too small! I could barely get the 2T over my 15 month old’s head.
4.0,"Purse is good quality soft leather, but only four stars because strap is not leather. Nice anyway, will see how it wears."
4.0,"You can tell that they are original crystals have an unusual gloss and look great, arrived well packaged and very careful"
4.0,I loved this dress! It’s beautifully made and the small details really make it. Sadly it was too large in the chest and waist areas. I did measure and ordered according but focused on the girls fitting. I will definitely be replacing this item before October 2021 with one from this collection of not the same.  I ordered this one for Halloween though and because of the fit I had to skip the dress up this year.
4.0,"The mask looks good - I would give it 5 star but resin on the left cheek/ear was weak and spit. Superglue was great bonding agent so the issue was fixed. The rest of mask had a strong coat of resin.  - Just paint, add sunglasses lens to the inside and dreadlocks and your all set to be a Predator."
4.0,Cute shoes.  Comfortable heel.  Upper strap rubs on the ankle a bit.
4.0,"Love it, comfortable, lightweight and pretty"
4.0,Fits as expected<br /> Feels nice.
4.0,I thought this shirt had real string lace and real buttons all fake stuff on shirt kinda disappointed but it will do
4.0,Quality of material is not the best but the colors are beautiful and the fit is good.
4.0,"I purchased this product about 5 months ago, i lost the top ball of the green one. was very sad because i was most excited about having a green belly ring. the rest are great! you have to make sure the top ball is always tight so you dont loose it. very happy with this purchase for the price!!"
4.0,"Smaller than expected, but very nicely made and true to picture!"
4.0,"Good looking, but the only downside is that it was made in China"
4.0,"Excellent for keeping your life together if you are naturally scattered like I am. The only things I would change would be adding more lines (if your writing is large, this is DEFINITELY for you!), the color (I bought this in-store and couldn't find this format in a more neutral color scheme), and perhaps one side of the page being projects with the other side being a daily tasklist. These changes would make this something I couldn't live without!"
4.0,"I Put this item in a gift a gift basket,  it looked nice"
4.0,"I am 5’4 - 5’5, 135lbs petite / fit curvy... I bought a small as my measurements are around 32/27/38 and I am not displeased. The top could have been a little bit longer in the cup but it’s a tube... I knew what to expect with the cut. Bottoms fit very nicely and fall right at the break of my hips for a sexy deep v. I bought this suit as a base for my Caribbean carnival costume. Can’t wait to see how it turns out."
4.0,Great fit well and feels good
4.0,"These looked like they would be very large out of the package, but the fit is flattering, and they're nice quality. The perfect pair of longer black shorts!"
4.0,I love this shirt it's so cute but the stuff on it is starting to come off in the wash.
4.0,"Maybe not my fit, I was hoping for something a little less baggy and more modern."
4.0,Ended up sewing the Cleveland area together a little bit more as it was a little too revealing for a graduation dress. Otherwise very comfortable and very pretty.
4.0,Purse is as discribed.
4.0,Nice top. as pictured
4.0,"Absolutely precious, just wish it had a bell like most cat collars."
4.0,Love this for my daughters bows! And great quality at a wonderful price! It looks just like the pic!
4.0,cheap but work batteries are worth more than you pay for all. not replaceable throw away when dead
4.0,"It's does what I need it to do. Spinning around clockwise or counter clockwise and keeps the time. It was the most economical winder I could find, so I don't mind the plastic as much. But it's not elegant"
4.0,Bought as a gift and was well received
4.0,got some chinese letters on the badge but cute af
4.0,"My wife loves these mugs.  Sadly, one arrived broken.  I contacted amazon who made it right and reminded me again why I'm a prime member.  4 stars for the mugs.  5 stars for Amazon."
4.0,"The pants are nice. I really like them,  but they're too long for me."
4.0,"Fit wonderfully, nice soft light weight fabric... Love it"
4.0,The ring came on time and in a nice container. It's been a couple of months and there is already a rip in it which is surprising at how tough the ring felt. Great warenty.
4.0,"I got these earrings for my niece so she can have a pair of &#34;fancy&#34; earrings when she goes out to weddings (or plays tea party!). I haven't given it to her yet but I will say, I know she's just going to love them! They come in a surprisingly nice jewelry box! Amazing presentation because the color of the box is so elegant and the box itself is made so nicely and doesn't feel cheap (her mom will prob think I spent a lot more on the earrings than what I truly spent!). The pearl is really pretty and the stones around it are bright! For the purpose of why I bought them, they are perfect! Great for a little girl feel special when wearing it! Only downfall is the stud in the back was a wee bit off centered/slanted. But overall, I'm pleased with this purchase and I believe my niece (and her mom) will be too!<br /><br />Disclaimer: I was given this item for free/discounted rate in exchange for my honest unbiased review."
4.0,"This was a very cute top. Was just a little too small around my arms/shoulders for me, and wasn’t a good style for my pear body shape. Made me look 10x chunkier in the middle than I am since it ties and flares just below my bust, but on the right body type it would be great. Just wear a cami underneath because it comes to be very low cut when tied and the matieral is kind of rough, so you might like something as a barrier to your skin."
4.0,"The dress is cute and comfy, but I did not receive the anklet (not a deal breaker). I am 5'5&#34; 34D and 113 lbs. I usually wear a small but I bought size medium to accommodate the bust as described in the &#34;special&#34; sizing chart. It fits perfectly, not too tight yet shows off the curves. The material is light weight and soft, although not durable nor thick enough to rate 5 stars. Also, there are no washing instruction tags, so do I hand wash or machine wash?"
4.0,"Some what small, but it's really cute."
4.0,"Great purchase for the money. It is a bit thin and cheaply made, but if well taken care of, it can be a good addition to your summer business casual shirt collection."
4.0,"So comfy but too big. Sometimes you can get away with a sandal being a little big or a little small—not the case with these. They were too big and although they were so comfy, they looked ridiculous. They are a sandal that you need them to fit just right."
4.0,"Boots came on they were supposed to,The description was correct the only problem I had was the boots were a size too big.are usually wear a size 10 but these boots with a true to size and all."
4.0,I really like the way the straps fit.  I wear a 34DD.  So I ordered a size 12.  The top fits nice in the chest area.  The skirt part of the top is longer than I like.  The shorts fit below the bellybutton and is shorter in the legs than I thought they would be.  All said it's not bad just a few tweeks I might be able to do.  I am anxious to wear this swimming to see how it holds up.
4.0,The dress is so pretty. Just wish I knew the bottom was see through
4.0,Exactly as described -  I bought this with the matching chain/medallion as accessories for my Halloween pimp costume - Very happy with it!
4.0,my daughter loved them worked out great for her cosplay costume
4.0,I had some very cute dress although it is very see through. You would need to wear a strapless slip.
4.0,It's a decent clutch purse that's just the right size. I just wish the material wasn't thin.
4.0,"Cheap, but decent, the fabric is soft but not thick, a good summer sweater. I can tell after a few washes it will start to pill."
4.0,"One quick con that's actually a pro for me: it looks like the hem is asymmetrical in the photo but it laid flat for me.  Which was great, because that's what I preferred.  Minus one star for the difference between photo and actual item.<br /><br />I didn't even use the belt.  Might later, but appreciate that it's a completely separate piece so I can wear it high or low or not at all."
4.0,the design is beautiful but is almost transparent
4.0,"Pricey but worth it.  Pkg arrived in good condition, hat has perfect shape, fits my big head  ^_^"
4.0,"I usually wear a small purse around my waist to keep my cell phone handy and to carry a few necessities, such as, ID, credit card, a little cash, lipstick, asthma inhaler, and epi-pen. This bag works. It's a little stiff, but it serves the purpose and looks quite nice."
4.0,Placement of the lettering is a little lower so don’t expect to tuck the shirt in but it was a cute shirt for my daughter!
4.0,Fits pretty well. Looks a bit awkward sometimes but honestly great pants that I will use.
4.0,"Great mini dress for the price.  Stitching could be better on the bottom, but this is skin tight, so you shouldn't see the inside of it.  Not that it will come apart, it looks strong, just could have used one more row of stitching or cut the fabric shorter at the seam is all.  Sexy!"
4.0,"Love them, just what I was looking for!"
4.0,"Fits true to size, very comfortable and very flattering.  I would definitely recommend this item"
4.0,The baggies weren't labeled idk which is which
4.0,"I am 6', 170lbs and 32&#34; waist, they fit me just great plus they are not too baggy like some of the other low crotch styles.  I really like the fit/style but one word of caution, even when I washed them on cold water they color bled.  Just be careful when washing them for the first couple of times because I did have some bleeding onto my other clothes in the dark wash."
4.0,The sizing is definitely meant to be oversized. The quality of material is thick and keeps you warm
4.0,"I received these yesterday. When I pulled them out of the plastic bag, they looked so small. Too small. When I finally put them on, well that was a work out in itself! 😂 I had to roll them up like I was putting socks on. It was a tight squeeze. The fabric feels kinda cheap, but they are not see through. They are breathable which I like! I sat on my bed, mind that I do have 4 dogs that believe my bed is theirs, and ABSOLUTELY NO hairs have stuck to me! That is a big win in my book. Although there was a snag in the top where it is see through, which I have pictured, they still feel really nice. And I pulled the snag and it seems to be ok now. The ""see through"" part at the top is just held together by little plastic strings. So I don't know how long they will last. I suggest going with the size you normally wear when given small medium large ect as an option.  Also, I have a little pudge on my stomach, and this is making my stomach look flat!!  5'5"" 118 lbs. And the MEDIUM is perfect after you actually get them on"
4.0,"Nice spring jacket. Thin, but works"
4.0,The quality of these sunglasses is amazing for the price but sadly they didn't fit my face shape so I had to return them
4.0,"Very nice mask. Curvature of fabric is very good to form fit the face. The color, teal, is very pretty. I gave it 4 *'s because I had to wash it in Ride with febreeze to get rid of the neoprene odor...I'm very sensitive to odors. Washed beautifully."
4.0,"This is a pretty cute shirt. The XXL is actually not that big. I am 5'7"" at about 200lbs and usually wear a L-XL or a size 12-14. This XL fits actually almost right, just a tad loose but for a shirt like that I don't mind that at all. So this shirt runs just a tad small.<br /><br />The material feels pretty soft even though it is pretty much all synthetic. It is a cute little wide strap tank top with a leopard print insert. I like that it is not short in the torso so it actually hangs past your rear. The shirt is well made and comfortable to wear. This can be nicely layered with a little cardigan when it is not warm out or worn on its own once summer is here."
4.0,Thought they would be slightly larger.
4.0,It's very pretty. It fits nicely even though my breasts are large. Lol
4.0,"I love this skirt.  I normally wear a size 12 (US), but it is still a little big on me, and I ordered a large. Otherwise, the colors are very vibrant and the material is wonderful.  Great quality."
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:3e900c171fddca9bdfc1b55938b467a8]] Love the colors, the material is soft & comfortable but it is a loose, runs large. I used a ribbon to tie right below the bust & now is super cute."
4.0,I like the quality and length and everything but I thought the lighting bolt was sequins so I was a bit disappointed.
4.0,"Material a little thin, will be good in the summer evenings."
4.0,"It is adorable, however I think it's intended for more of a B-C. I am a size 6, 34DD and this is just not all that flattering. For the price I can't complain just keep in mind that you are going to see spillage."
4.0,"they seem to run very small.  they are bright, light airy fabric,  shipped fairly fast"
4.0,It’s a bonnet lol
4.0,"A bit shorter than I was expecting, and also a bit tighter. I use them as layering pieces -- too tight and think to wear alone."
4.0,Cute top.  Nice fit.
4.0,"Fits as expected, it's a loose fit and it is made of mostly rayon so it looses more shape/fit as you wear it. I got a large but would probably want a smaller size."
4.0,Great except for lack of a back pocket
4.0,"I was excited to receive this shirt because of the look and perfect timing for the weather. It’s a bit bigger than expected and the cotton is not as soft as I expected. I’m going to wash it and see if that changes the fee and size altogether. Otherwise, not a bad looking shirt."
4.0,"Fits very well, super comfortable. They don't seem to want to stay centered on my and the rips always end up more on the inside on both sides. Little annoying. Overall love them would suggest"
4.0,"Fits a bit large, but the color is vibrant and quality ok for price"
4.0,"I really liked these slippers, however, they fell apart pretty easily from little use. I only wish these were more durable. Otherwise, they are quite warm and comfortable."
4.0,"Very thin fabric. The shirt flares at the bottom and didn't drape softly so I sewed a seam to fix it. I also wanted a short sleeve shirt for summer and this fabric was so thin that I cut the sleeves off. Good thing I can sew! Very stretchy fabric which I like because sometimes sleeves are too tight when they are made in China.  The color is pretty. I thought it might be more red, but it is more of a coral/rose.  I am 5'8"" about 160 lbs and 38B - I ordered a Large and it fits (with the alteration to the bottom because I didn't like the way it flared out)."
4.0,It is a very nice looking luggage set. I would have given it 5 stars if it weren't for the plastic covering all three pieces. We had to use a knife to get it off and unfortunately we still weren't able to get all of it.
4.0,A little big. Large would have fit me better
4.0,its nice...and material comfortable bought US size 4-6
4.0,I got the size 12 - it fit perfect. I'm 5'3 160ish - 170 curvy - wore to a wedding felt sexy - figure flattering but use spanx - I was a little self conscious about my stomach - all in all good buy :)
4.0,Very good quality an will be Ordering more 👌
4.0,"Nice and comfortable.  Form-fitting at the chest and flairs out, around the hips.  I'd give it 5 stars if it didn't flair out so much.  Just a little too much flair.  But, it is very flattering because it hides a lot.  The length is perfect for someone like me, who wants to hide their knees!  I think this dress can be worn with dressy shoes (as shown) or with boots (short or long).  The dress is very versatile."
4.0,"Ok, so i really love it !!!😊"
4.0,"Really comfortable and cute, but only giving 4 stars because one came with a hole in it. Other than that I love them and they work great!"
4.0,mu husband liked it
4.0,"Great key chain, nice touch for your Caddy FOB"
4.0,Great except too Long for a MIDI
4.0,They work well for inexpensive sunglasses.  Probably won't last long because they are flimsy but great for a pair you don't have to worry about losing or breaking.
4.0,Slightly larger than i thought it would be. They are well made and sturdy.
4.0,Absolutely gorgeous mask for a Masquerade Party. The string did not keep the mask on very well though.
4.0,"I wear a small/medium.  Ordered a large and they are like a small.  For summer they are too thick.  Great under tank.  Order at least 2 sizes up if you don't want to feel like it's stuck to you.  Also, straps are odd, very short. Not sure about them!!! I donated the 4 I bought to a young girl."
4.0,"I have a fat neck, so this is mostly my own problem, but I would have loved for the inner necklace to be about 1/2"" longer so that it lays flat on me. Currently it is a touch short and rolls around on my neck fat and the star is insideout a lot of the time. It is beautiful and it is the best necklace design I've seen in a long time, just the length is a touch short for me."
4.0,"Soft, comfy, cute. But thin!"
4.0,"It's super cute. I normally wear an XS. I'm 5'1&#34; and 95 lbs and bought a small. Yeah, TOO small! First time ever needed to order a medium!"
4.0,While I know this is meant to fit everyone that doesn’t mean it’s very comfortable for everyone. I do like how it looks and the size of the cuff it just feels weird on my wrist. My 9 year old really liked it though and so I gave it to her. It’s definitely an accessory to make a nice date outfit have a little more jazz or just for a party. It’s light weight and nice to look at.
4.0,"The fit is a little tight, I think it's actually a junior sized t-shirt. Left black stains under my arms from the dye, but otherwise, it's a very nice shirt. It's soft, it holds up in the wash pretty well, and it's somewhat stretchy. Order a size up, and wash before wearing, and it should be just fine."
4.0,It fit smaller than expected but still turned out nice
4.0,It’s single layer the neck and hand bands are added in
4.0,Soft and I love the color. Definitely runs large.
4.0,Purchased a large dress was big but very nice! I would recommend going down at least a size when ordered.
4.0,Great size just wished the straps weren't so thin.
4.0,"I like the shoes, but I wish they were available in size 11. That way I could wear them with socks if I want to. I had some similar to these that I could wear with socks and they worked great."
4.0,I purchased this dress in a medium and it fit nicely. Material is soft and stretchy so you will not feel squeezed and uncomfortable. Overall very happy with this buy. I am about 5'2 and weigh around 160ish. A little busty. Medium fits great.
4.0,"Gorgeous, elegant dress. The top is large so I had to go down 2 sizes. I have 34DDD boobs, so that was a surprise. Beautiful color, I would definitely suggest wearing shapewear under it."
4.0,On the long a side<br />For height of 5.2<br />Everything else fits as it.says
4.0,I ordered a large and but my husband dried it so now it fits more like a small/medium. Still comfy and cute. If you’re wanting the baggy look order up two sizes or line dry it.
4.0,Very comfortable shoe.  A little on the large size.
4.0,Grandson loved his new hat!
4.0,"Material is a little ruff but it fits nice and is warm,."
4.0,"Ok so everyone has their &#34;thing&#34;.  Mine are bags/purses/pocketbooks,  whatever you'd like to call them.  I ordered this bag the second I saw it.  I have a variety of colors, but not a mustard yellow.  This bag is made of Ostrich and wow is it soft!  This supplement bag has a gold clasp that secures it, and an inner bag that you can totally pull out of the bag if you don't need it.  The soft dots all along the purse add a very nice texture to it.  Two hands allow you to hold it in your hand or there is a detachable strap so you can carry it on your shoulder.  The stitching is very tight,  well made. Perfect adjustable strap so you can put it at any height you might need.  I really like this bag, it's very roomy, no need to worry about what will or won't fit.<br />DISCLAIMER:  I received this product discounted in exchange for my honest and unbiased review."
4.0,Exactly as described. I like it. Just wish it was a little deeper to cover my ears better.
4.0,Didn't realize from photos that there is red shiny foil on Mickey... but still cute
4.0,"These are good, actually a 14g and no bumps along the bar. I wish the balls at the end were smaller. Not broken and the ball have not fallen off, threads are holding up and I use them for nipple rings."
4.0,Comfortable thick and holds everything in place. Does not ride up legs stays in place.
4.0,I like it but I would like in silver chain.
4.0,Love this top! It is lightweight and very comfortable & it is true to size
4.0,Use in hot yoga. So far doesn't slip off my head and seat from rolling in the eyes. like the grip on the inside. Could be a little tighter but I have a small head. Will find out once washed how holds up. Only used 2xs so far. Good value for the money.
4.0,"This tank is made of thin tee shirt like material. It is true to size, perhaps a tad big. The lace trim adds visual interest. The bottom is higher in the front than the back. The purple is pretty.  I was expecting a more contoured cut. But it looks fine and is comfortable."
4.0,Waist is a little higher than expected.  Very pretty.  Not crazy about the material.
4.0,"not what I had hoped for, but what I expected"
4.0,A bit larger than size expected
4.0,"Really cute dress for warmer weather. Or worn with tights and a sweater for cooler weather. It does look a little smaller to me. I ordered a 2T had I known I would have got a 3T. The heart has texture, and there are pockets! Too cute<br />***Update it’s not too small it actually fits according to size. The model usually wears between 18/24 months and 2T she’s wearing in the photo has plenty of room."
4.0,its cute! flashy and very..umm BIG. its my size and all. im happy with my purchase :)
4.0,a bit low
4.0,The large is more of a med glad i bought it that way. Read the reviews .Read the reviws.<br />My daughter is a 5'10&#34; large was great in length and a med size.
4.0,"Nice looking watch, but won't stay latched."
4.0,Looks great on my girl! Heavier than I thought it would be.
4.0,Really cute statement necklace.  4 out of 5 stars because its a little heavy though - but I can live with it.  Arrived sooner than expected.
4.0,It was durable
4.0,"I have never been much of a hat wearer due to having bangs. However, this past summer, I decided to grow them out, therefore, the bangs are not an issue any more. Another issue that I have had with hats is that my head is on the large side and it's been difficult to find ones that fit. I was pleasantly surprised that this hat (size m/l) actually fits without being tight! I've been wearing it outside when I'm doing yard work, but plan to wear it while kayaking or participating in other outdoor activities, too. The hat doesn't look as crisp as the picture. I wouldn't say it is wrinkled, but it's not smooth either. There are a few creases from being folded. The dark navy color helps keep it from looking too messy. I don't mind the non-smooth look. There's a chin strap to keep the hat in place. Overall, I am very pleased with it!"
4.0,Bought this for my husband to wear to a Great Gatsby themed party - for the price this was the perfect outfit for him and he could use it later. The quality was really pretty  - the tie is very nice and the colors are great. The only criticism would be the suspender clips were not very tight but they worked fine.
4.0,"This is a lovely pillow cover. The background color is more ivory than beige. I bought the 20&#34; case and filled it with a 22' pillow. The corners are a little sharp and the pillow did not fill it out completely. I don't know if this could be remedied by a 24&#34; pillow, or not, but I am happy with the purchase."
4.0,"i love this top for working out!  it's comfortable, cute, and cost effective.  i'm 5'6'' and 135 lbs and a medium fits perfectly!  it's cropped, but not so cropped that my stomach shows when worn with high waisted leggings.  the only reason i didn't give it five stars is that i've noticed that the neckline has become a bit misshapen after wearing it and washing it for about six months.  i might suggest air drying it to preserve the shape."
4.0,"I ordered based on my weight, and though it looked impossibly small when I first saw it, it did stretch enough, and it is warm.  My only reservation is that, after I get them pulled up and walk around, they pull down from my waist so that the crotch is hanging down and man backside is somewhat exposed.  Pretty uncomfortable, but the gap is covered by my coat when I go out, so I guess it works okay."
4.0,I love this mask.  It's easy to wear and easy to wash.  I love that i make people smile when I wear it.
4.0,Great for my costume!
4.0,It arrived quick and has all the parts and pieces of the product like they said it would. I got it to use at a later date.  So I haven't inspected product outside the clear plastic wrap.
4.0,It made wearing a mask fashionable
4.0,These are great sunglasses for the price point. Love that they include a nice case and cloth.
4.0,My husband loved this sweater
4.0,Didnt expect them to be clear-ish
4.0,It is beautiful and it fits nicely on my daughters ear.  The only reason for four stars is that it arrived with one of the pearls loose in the box and I had to get some super glue to glue it back on.
4.0,"I just need to find out if the description is real , then I will love it ."
4.0,This dress fits too big through my chest and fits well if I wear a good padded bra.  It did fit great through my waist and hip area.  I ordered a medium because reviews on Amazon stated it ran small.  The color is great.  The fabric is so soft.  It could be a dress I can dress up for work or an afternoon lunch with friends.
4.0,It's really long.
4.0,"The size is just right, the pattern is just like the picture shows, it is very cute and suitable for indoor slippers."
4.0,Product is very comfortable and stretchy. I had my 4th child a few months ago so I was looking for something forgiving until I get back into shape. I weigh 153 and wear a size 10/12. I bought the mediums based off other reviews saying they fit larger than normal. They were slightly snug which leads me to believe they are true to size for my body type. I don’t plan to return them since it isn’t that much of a difference.
4.0,Looks great and my grandson loves it!
4.0,"They’re actually dark green colored frame not black as I thought, they kind of fall off my nose as well."
4.0,"My granddaughter got this set for her birthday.  She love the Princesses from Frozen.  She knows who's who, and whether its Frozen or Frozen II. What delightful shirt for a fan."
4.0,I don’t like the elastic on the cuffs of the arms or the white buttons on the front. But other than that I wear it quite a bit.
4.0,The shirt was not as bad as people are leading on.  The only problem I had was it was more snug than loose and maybe that's because I didn't pay close attention to the sizing.  The material is as pictured and so is the shirt.  I would purchase again but I can and have made use of this shirt. I will upload a pic to calcify my comment. People need to stop exaggerating facts because this is someone's livelihood.
4.0,It was the right price but the material is kind of thin....not as nice as I have bought for a couple dollars more.
4.0,A full 10 didn't work but for the price they were great party favors. Fall apart easily.
4.0,Really cute for the price. I bought and xl and could prob squeeze into a L but xl is still fine.  Very stretchy material and super comfortable. Not bad amazon!
4.0,"I ordered these for a &#34;poodle themed&#34; occasion.  They are really very cute.  The body wiggles too!!  I would give 5 stars, but they are just a little heavy for my ears.  I will wear them anyway.  Wish they came in pink."
4.0,"Very soft and comfy. Love the style, but wish it were a little tighter in the waist area. I’m 5’6” 123 lbs, wearing a small. I do think it will be cute tied in the front or with a French tuck."
4.0,"Outfit was cute.  Did not care for the small apron type attachment on front, but dress fit well."
4.0,"Having difficulty getting them to stay in place on my ears, but they are beautiful and look just as picture."
4.0,My son loves these although he does not wesr them as dress socks.  We purchased for the design.
4.0,Love this piece. It is an attention grabber and can be dressed up or down. My only issue it that it runs maybe a half a size too small. But I can’t wait to where this piece. I will be pairing it with a fitted pencil skirt
4.0,"The color is more light brown than appears in the picture, but still pretty and fits well"
4.0,"only downfall is this watch face is larger than i expected. Its cute and I still wear it the face is huge, looks more like something that someone with poor eye sight would want"
4.0,"I love the color and the zip compartment which is deep enough to put a credit card in for quick access. I'm getting use to the snap closure.<br />It has four slots for cards, three side inside pockets for (folded) bills and any additional cards.  It's a small wallet yet a good size for carrying cards, bills, a few receipts and coins and still keep its shape and form.  I don't like the look of bulky or over stuffed wallets, so this works for a smaller wallet.  Plus the color stands out in oversized/carryall bags. :)"
4.0,Dresses were to be longer in the back than the front.  The pictures must be exaggerated.  Both my dresses are the same.  I like because they are cotton/linen.  Seems to be made well.  Comfortable.  Will not wear until spring/summer.
4.0,For the price it is a nice dress. It is made out of cheaper cotton material that normally doesn’t hold up to many washings but time will tell.
4.0,Shoes are adorable but they are catastrophic for feet. The rubber material made my feet so raw..
4.0,Very sturdy and spacious for its size. The leather is smooth and gorgeous. I like the hardware because it has more of a rose gold tone than a gold tone. The extra pockets are nice.<br /><br />Would have given five stars but one of the holes for the buckles wasn’t cut out and one was still kind of attached. It also came dented on one side so I’m having issues with it getting worse the more I use it.
4.0,"Cute dress but too short, im 5ft6 inch and is above my knees.. wiil be returning it"
4.0,Quality is good. Stretches a bit. It runs big.
4.0,"I took away 1 star because it is a little easily broken for an anklet. An anklet takes a bit of a beating so needs to be a little stronger. But I have to say as for appearance, she absolutely LOVES IT!"
4.0,Super cute. Good quality but way too big. I ordered a Small and it fit my co-worker who says she normally wears a large.
4.0,I have quite a few of this brand and I like them. They are great for work or dates. You can match them with leggings or pants or jeans and they will look great.
4.0,Very nice bathing suit. It does run small tho.
4.0,These boots are very cute but run small. I am a size 9 or 9.5 so I bought a size 10 and my feet fit pretty snug. When I first put them on I thought they were too tight but after a little while of wearing them they loosened up. I would definitely recommend buying the next size up especially if you want to wear cozy socks with them.
4.0,"Love the color, feel and the style....especially the thumb holes in the sleeve to help keep your hands warm. It's soft, and light weight, but VERY warm. The collar is low, but when zipped up will keep your neck warm nicely. I love it. The only think that kept me from giving it a 5-star was that is has no pockets."
4.0,"Fits perfectly, the material is just a little thin hence the 4 stars."
4.0,It's smaller than than I thought it it would be.  It is pretty.
4.0,Shipped fast. One of the gems fell off.
4.0,Arrived fast great price
4.0,Runs large. I am 5’6” 135lb with broader shoulders. I wear a medium and I had to return this shirt and reorder a small. It’s very soft and comfy and I got tons of compliments! Happy Fall Y’all
4.0,"This is a very nice looking wallet. I loved it!<br />I'm just going to state what didn't work so well for me :<br /><br />- It was actually smaller than my previous wallet, it took me some time (couple weeks) to get used to that feeling.<br />- I carry many small notes/papers (about 4-7) that I write on the go that I store them in the wallet for later use, it doesn't have any problem storing but I'd always struggle to put my bills in, specially when it gets a bit bulky. My previous wallet didn't have that problem.<br />- This wallet definitely looks durable but helas, I've had mine for about 6 months now and it's starting to tear from the inside, which I didn't expect at all.<br /><br />Overall, it definitely looks great but its functions are below my expectation."
4.0,"I gave this 4 stars because the description does state finger ring. As you can see from the photos the ring when worn on the finger is quite bulky. I wouldn’t find this comfortable. I purchased them as decorative pieces, not to wear. So that wasn’t a problem for me. Overall I was happy with my purchase and would recommend if buying as decorations."
4.0,"My little one loves Doc so much. She loves this shirt, and I love that it's so true the character. And not pink or purple."
4.0,"Had a gray sweatshirt from Russell that's at least 15 years old. Except for the side panels, this shirt is just like it. Except neck is smaller, but that's better. Nice quality material, good workmanship, fast delivery. Cuffs are a little snug, length could be a bit shorter."
4.0,Great looking and easy to look at. Love it..
4.0,I love the way the blouse fits. I just wish the fabric had a bit more body to it.
4.0,"I would deffently recamend these to any one, from the skinny Minnie's to the jr. plus, they fit REALY good, and has just the right amount of breathable space"
4.0,Pleasantly surprised at how comfortable and how well this fit.  I am 5’ 3” and 128 lbs and I ordered the small in black. I am a size 6 or 8 depending on make and style. This is not a flimsy dress at all.  It is fully lined and seems well made.  My only complaint is that the zipper sticks mid zip and I needed help to get it up and down.  I can’t wait to wear it to a wedding Sunday!
4.0,"Just what I was looking for!  A loose formal dress for cruise.  The fabric isn’t as nice as I expected, but good for the price."
4.0,"Very pretty dress! Very see-through (ivory color) and quite short. I’m only 5’4, so it’s rare for dresses to be “too short” on me, but this one is pretty darn short. It’s just a tad tight around my 38DD chest. XL would probably fit better. Overall cute for the price, but not the highest quality (which I expected.)"
4.0,The size runs small. We got my 12 year old who is lean and 5 feet 4 inch a medium and fits good.
4.0,"Por ser de marca pensé que tenía mejor calidad ,pero está bueno ."
4.0,"Looks great but the screws are a bit delicate.  It fell apart on my face, but only after about 6 months of light use."
4.0,It was a gift. The child broke the chain the first day. But it did make her very happy before she broke it. Delivery and packaging was perfect.
4.0,"Nice basic tee. I wish the sleeves were a bit longer. It’s soft and has a bit of stretch. I normally wear a small or medium and felt the medium fit perfectly, the small would have been too snug. Great for lounging or for everyday wear."
4.0,Very cool to look at but it's so small and you can barely see the mosquito in it even with the little magnified box it comes in but my son loved it.
4.0,I like the shirt and it’s color. The smell of it was so bad I had to wash it twice!
4.0,I know alot of people dinged them cause they don't work well for touch screen but I don't care about that.  I was wanting them more for warmth and softness.  They hit both of those really well.  I like how they go totally over my wrists so it prevents any skin from showing below my coat sleeves.
4.0,"It's cute and I can fit into it, but one size does not fit all."
4.0,Lasted much longer than expected before turning my skin colors.
4.0,"beautiful tree , the amatista is very pretty and exactly as the photo"
4.0,"Solid ring, runs slightly smaller then sized, I have several other rings all in the same size and this one runs tighter. Order a half size bigger then what you normally wear.  Detailing is a little more muted then I'm the picture but still very nice"
4.0,Great. Wish the chain was longer.
4.0,Very well-made sweatshirt at a good price.  Fits loose compared to other size medium sweatshirts I own but feels great on an allows great freedom of movement.  Fabric nice and thick and soft.
4.0,It's not bad. It's not a sweater like I expected and it's a little longer than expected but it's not bad! I like it overall.
4.0,"My son has fat and wide feet, so finding a shoe that is stylish and doesn't compress his feet are hard to find. These shoes were at a reasonable price which I love. My husband even asked if they had any in his size! Lol"
4.0,"I purchased both an XL as well as a L. I typically wear a size medium in tops and a 6/8 in pants. The XL was a little big on top, but when I tried the L on, it seemed to make my unwanted fat stick out more, so I was okay with the larger size. Being able to tie the strap around my neck was enough to make sure it's tight. The underwire really doesn't do anything, but it's the same for both sizes. The XL was just more comfortable all around and seemed to lay nicer... The bottoms weren't really that different between both sizes, but the XL was definitely more comfortable.  The L was a little snug in the thigh area, but if the L top would have been a little larger, the L bottoms would have been doable. Overall, the suit is really cute, well-made, and seems to be pretty comfortable. The XL was the best fit for me, but like I said, I could have gone with the L, it was just a little snug. Maybe if I was a little more toned and lost a few pounds, the L would have worked, but I'd rather be comfortable :)"
4.0,"Bought this for my friend's wedding. It's very comfortable and stretches. The color is more of a cream, but exactly what my friend wanted. Will wear again, since it is so comfy"
4.0,I like that they fit my small head and stylish. Feel like they could break easy. But for the price they are worth it.
4.0,"I really like it, it is cheap and it really looks like the picture. The only reason Im not giving it 5 stars it's because one of the antennas of the butterfly was broken, which really pisses me off! Other than that, I love it!"
4.0,The color is beautiful! It just needs to be shorter..the length is too long.
4.0,"I bought an xs and I am 5'8. Although the fit and he material is gorgeous, I could use a little bit of length since it ends a tad awkwardly at my calfs. Not sure if that's how it is supposed to be."
4.0,"Grabbed a set of these off amazon after seeing them at a vendor during a convention who wanted more than double what you can get them for on here.  They are fun and cool looking and work great as safety glasses for nerf wars.  Only downside was there isnt a button for turning on and off.  You have to remove the batteries when your done, which can be tricky too.  All in all though, we are happy with these!"
4.0,"The description is very misleading. It uses plural words like &#34;item is a pair of&#34; and &#34;they are&#34;, the picture also shows 4 different shapes, however; it is only one shape that you are buying. It's the star. It is still really cute. I bought it as a nose ring, but I wish I would have read the whole description and known that it was only one."
4.0,Fits well and is a good material! I really Like it !
4.0,A little heavier than I expected. Overall nice look and quality.
4.0,"This is a nice cardigan.  The green color is a little lighter than the photos but the fit is as expected (true to size) and the material seems good quality.  It's not super soft, but not irritating either.  If they come up on deal again I might get other colors."
4.0,"My significant other is always sticking his tie in his food. This looked a little small, but he said they all are that size. He liked it. It matches his style well. I think it was a bit pricey, but I like to think I paid for quality."
4.0,"This web belt is exactly what I was looking for, an adjustable belt. It was easy to shorten the length. I have purchased 2 to them, silver and one black buckle and they are holding up fine and month of use. The only disappointment is the removable elastic belt loop. Both are getting frayed and starting to look a little ratty after 8 + month of use. I almost lost one when I had to remove the belt at airport security. I pulled of the belt and I didn't realize I had lost the loop until the lady behind me handed it to me.........After that experience I would suggest the seller include a spare instead of the plastic buckle. I highly recommend to anyone looking for an adjustable belt."
4.0,So cute. He loves them. Wish I'd gotten the next size up.
4.0,I like the size of this purse and the color.  The material is very soft and there are lots of compartments.  The only problem with this purse for me is the lack of structure.  It is very soft and so does not sit up on it's own at all which makes it hard to find items on the bottom of the purse.
4.0,Very nice shoes. Consider buying a sz up if you have wide feet.
4.0,I have just started wearing this at the computer to help me control my posture as I am recovering from some shoulder problems. The orthopedist wants me to pay much closer attention to my posture as I am at the computer several hours a day and I know I &#34;slouch&#34; a fair amount.  This Shirt really helps me stay &#34;upright&#34;. Will be interesting to see how long the shirt holds together as there seems to be a lot of strain on the zipper and hooks especially when I am putting the shirt on so I am giving this four stars until I see how it holds up.  I am 5'10&#34; inches and weigh 185.  I tried the medium size and found it too difficult to get on so moved up to the large and that is much better.
4.0,"Really like how they look, however I do not like the clasp."
4.0,"I am a fit, curvy size 36D. I ordered the large. It did not even come close to fitting. Sad because it looked like a nice bra and good quality. Gave it 4 stars for deisgn and quality only and because it shipped fast and was easy to return. I had to return it as Large was the largest size available."
4.0,The dress is beautiful but long but for me that is fine since I am in a wheelchair and sit all the time.
4.0,"I'm a busty size 14 and the XL fit me perfectly. My only complaint is the ruffles on the chest area, which were odd looking with a DD chest. I got several compliments on the mustard color and the fabric pattern, though everyone agreed the ruffles were awkward."
4.0,"They are very cute, but definitely for an older child and not a toddler. They dont turn the ear green or anything of the sort. Over all, I'm happy with the purchase. Worth the price"
4.0,Super cute little outfit! Mu daughter loves it and it keeps her warm and cozy!
4.0,These polarized aviators cost so little that you could easily replace them if they get lost or broken. The arms are a bit chintzy but the lenses are fine and they protect my eyes from bright FL sun rays.
4.0,Size down they stretch overtime
4.0,This little outfit is awesome. I just wish it made it to me when it was supposed to so my granddaughter could have warn it in her pictures we had professional done.
4.0,"Love them, wish they were polarized"
4.0,"Very cool bracelet. Stays closed well. It says it is unisex, but the 7 looks like a child's bracelet next to my husband's wrist. I'm keeping it for me and ordering his an inch bigger. Definitely a good value."
4.0,The Arm Sleeves from OXA arrived right on time and in perfect condition. I started using them within a few days. They work fairly well but tend to slide down my arms as I golf. It may be because of the amount of moisture on the arms especially during the very hot summer in the CA desert. They do seem to protect my arms fro getting too much sun which is what I intended them to do so I am fairly happy.
4.0,"Sin servicio estupendo, me conformo  con el ptoducto"
4.0,Bie comodos y cuando manejas bien
4.0,The lace mask and head band aren’t neatly glued or fused together. The price and arrival were excellent.
4.0,"This is a very beautiful ring. Does not look cheaply made, but unfortunately the band did not fit. The stone ring fit little snug but slid right in, however, the band didn't even go half way up my finger. Seems as if they are 2 different sizes."
4.0,"I was extremely suprised how much I liked this bag. The only thing I don't like about it is the smell that it gives off I am hoping with time that will go away. I love the bag purse though, I am one that carries alot and also can use this as a small overnight bag. It's perfect. And the color is so pretty."
4.0,"Great fitting socks. They're very comfortable,  I had a few pairs that I had for about 5 years that was still a great condition that I purchased from Macy's, but Macy's and Atlanta does not carry them anymore so I found them on Amazon and ordered some more."
4.0,Better than expected for the price
4.0,Awesome. Love these. Except for the small scratch that came with them. So much for being brand new in the box.
4.0,Just gotta figure out a way to get the wings to stay nicely behind my bow tie.  It's very comfortable and sturdier than I imagined.
4.0,"I bought for my father, he likes it. He says it will take time to get use to taking it off, he thought it was a little hard.<br />I say go up a little bit on size, because it was a tight fit for a 50&#34; and his last 50&#34; belt fit perfectly with room, but not this one."
4.0,Got these to wear while playing golf. The pockets will come in handy. I wish the legs where a little longer like in the picture.
4.0,"I like them, but the non slip part isn't where I need it for Pilates (but I have difficult feet). They fit great and work just fine."
4.0,Very satisfactory for travel.
4.0,I don't know if the pants suppose to be high water a little but I still love the outfit
4.0,"So cute, love it!"
4.0,My daughter is rather tiny<br />It for her well!
4.0,"I ordered this as a gift for my husband and he loved it. The size is perfect, and it is a numbered limited edition....the only thing I wish it had is actual player signatures instead of copies, but we are very pleased with this item."
4.0,Ordered up but still small. Order 2-3 sizes up!
4.0,"The card holder pockets are pretty deep, but other than that I like this and it works well."
4.0,"The food was good and as expected. It is very cute. However, I did not realize the amount of skin that was going to be exposed in the back. You really cannot wear a bra with it or, if you do you just have to be OK with that showing.  I wear a camisole top underneath."
4.0,"I'm a tiny woman and I get really cold and it makes me... angry. This hat makes me look nuttier than a squirrel turd but holy moley is my head and face WARM! I usually wear balaclavas when running in the winter, but when you try to wear a balaclava on a packed train you get some real funny looks. This hat screams &#34;slightly crazy lady&#34; and not &#34;scary threatening person&#34;; perfect for me. I'd give it 4 stars but I really was interested in using the face mask alone around the office when I got sick but the elastic ear hoops are really small and too tight - they pull my ears forward like I'm Dumbo on take off - no thanks. Clipped in the facemask might be my favorite part, your breath circulates warm air over your ears. Surprisingly nice!"
4.0,"It doesn't look as good as it does in the picture, as the pattern is a bit different. But I like it."
4.0,Not much too it . It does what it needs go do and good for the price.
4.0,"I bought this for my boudoir closet and definitely thought it was the shape of a skirt, it is infact a line. It is very good quality though"
4.0,Loved it only thing is is that is tended to slip (thank goodness I had pasties) I’m 5’3 and weigh 115 I wear a 32B and it was cute for a festival just take caution and wear pasties
4.0,Size of bloomers. Not too be worn just casually. I bought mine for a costume. Very stretchy. I got a small.
4.0,"It looks like the picture, fits comfortably and is what I was looking for for the price."
4.0,It is very nice bracelet it is so light that you will think it is not silver... The only bad thing is that the pieces are not too tight so it come apart easy
4.0,"The top is cute but it runs at least one size big. I do not understand any of the comments that say it runs small. I ordered a large, my normal size, and it's so big that the sleeves drop off my shoulder. I can't wear it. I'm a 36C, 165 lbs, 5'9&#34;."
4.0,"Very cute and great price. One of the flowers did fall off, but that was expected. Very easily fixable with hot glue. Would not recommend for people with especially large craniums."
4.0,"Love this bag, it's super cute and practical. I can fit a good amount of things in it, including my 13inch macbook air if needed. I read complaints that the body of the bag isn't real leather as advertised, but so far it's held up and it looks real enough to pass. My feedback would be that the design for the 'backpack' form definitely needs some work. I can't get it to hang comfortable on my back no matter how many different ways I try to clip the straps on. I think the idea is great, and I'm always in the market for an actual PURSE that can be worn as a backpack and doesn't look stupid when you use it as a purse. This one doesn't quite make the cut but I like the purse functionality enough that it's still one of my go-to bags. I use one of the backpack straps to make it a messenger bag if I need to, but there aren't enough hooks so I wind up clipping the strap to one of the buckles which doesn't look great but works at least."
4.0,Adorable and a real conversation piece
4.0,"Great looking, comfortable shoe. Unfortunately, had to return it because it runs large. I have a wide foot and this  shoe was too wide. I suggest order a size down."
4.0,Has a hole!!! Runs little small. But stretchy and flattering so cute!  and I'm usually medium sometimes a small. So I ordered a large. I'm sad there's a hole. I'm 150lb 5'8. I could do medium but did large because I have some tummy
4.0,It was small but v pretty
4.0,"I didn't get to wear this yet, but the first thing I noticed was how soft it was.  I washed it & even through it in the dryer & it came out perfect.<br />I'm 5'2 & 118lbs. I got a size small but I wish they offered it in a XS, but I'll make it work."
4.0,I’d give it 5 stars if it wasn’t for the annoying tag on the side that I thought would easily rip off but made a tiny hole.
4.0,Great product. Wish the buttons control was in a different spot but it isn't really a big deal. One thing that did bother with was that they kept coming undone. So this product is purely for Aesthetics not practicality. Very nice glow thoigh.
4.0,Quality not all that but they worked.
4.0,"It's a bit tight, but when my hair is shorter, it should fit better.  I love the suede.  It's beautiful."
4.0,"These weee great for my costume, but please note these run small. I was able to get my hands in, but it was very tight. Buy a size larger than you think you’ll need to fit properly."
4.0,"Mask is very pretty, but thought it was a hard mask."
4.0,Cute. Not the best quality but I do like the size and color. The post wasn't glued on accurately. Kinda crooked. But I'm OCD. Lol. Fast shipping though. No complaints.
4.0,Reading the reviews really helped me order. I got a 6XL and it fits perfect. Love the color and material. It's really long so works great with leggings. I'm about 5'4&#34; and about 175lbs. (heavier on top) If you normally wear and XL then I would guess 6XL would fit perfect for you as well. This one had a 5XL and it doesn't button across my chest. Not even close. 6XL was a little big around my middle but tight on my chest. So I'm guessing there is not a perfect size for me. This one fortunately looks super cute wide open. I like the way the material feels too.
4.0,Very nice print or rendering only problem was it was done upside down so the nose contour is on the bottom where the chin goes other than that very nice mask love the filters
4.0,I really like my piece - it helps to dress it up a bit when I have to go somewhere nice.
4.0,"Very comfortable. The pads shift around a bit too much and constantly need to be readjusted, but otherwise very happy with purchase."
4.0,"it was unique and looked good.<br /><br />The dress was comfortable. The fit was okay, albeit a little loose. It wasn't too hot, which for me is important since we live in Florida.<br /><br />It wasn't too hard to clean.  It felt durable and the fabric was relatively soft. It would work in a wide variety of settings.<br /><br />It was as described and I would recommend it."
4.0,"This dress is very tasteful but still with a bit of sexy thrown in. The first dress I got was a small (Im 5'4, 140lbs, and 34B) it fit over all but the top was was to tight across my bust, the seem went right across my bust, squished my boobs down making it uncomfortable and  funny looking. Went with a medium and was a much better fit."
4.0,They are not as thick as in picture but overall keeps on you well.
4.0,More boxy then pictured and a bit bigger then I needed I'm a 40c and have a tummy if that helps with picking a size.
4.0,"I bought one set in gold for my husband to wear on vacation trip and he liked it so much, I ordered another set in blue.  Very very nice material, style and fit's as expected.  Thank you, the price is just right as well."
4.0,convenient bag!
4.0,Love the material..cute!
4.0,"This dress is cute. It's soft and has some stretch to it. It wrinkles VERY easily, and teh waist line is no where near your waist. It fits much more like an A-line dress, within the waist coming up just under the breasts. I feel like a wide belt would finish it off well. I ordered a medium. I'm 5'5&#34;, 145 and usually wear a med/8-10."
4.0,"My husband liked the quality of this shirt, it looked more expensive than it is. A tad on the small size so if deciding between two sizes, I’d recommend sizing up."
4.0,Very beautiful and perfect for oc cosplay! Just a little on the big side but that's alright! My Instagram is @sasaina_cosplay btw
4.0,It's pretty and I like that it is made out of surgical steel. Not as bright as I thought it would be though!
4.0,Nice umbrella. Colors are true to picture. Very pleased with the ease of tilt mechanism.
4.0,This dress runs a little big and is a bit too long but very cute and comfy!
4.0,"The necklaces are darling. I've purchase two. My daughter (3) loves the snail. The little box it came in is probably her favorite. I gave it four stars because the box broke after she played with it for a while. However, I did not see what she did so it may be our fault. The necklace itself is darling and perfect for a little girl."
4.0,"It feels cheaply made but aside form that, I like this Shirt. Its a little on the small side but That's okay I ordered Up in size :D"
4.0,"Hello Kitty 😅 …haven’t really used them yet, but they are cute truly…& feels sturdy 🤷🏻‍♀️🤪"
4.0,I ordered an xl. I’m between a large and xl. It fits more like an xxl. Very loose. Material is very soft and I will keep it. Length is past my hips .
4.0,The glasses come with a protective case...perfect for the glove compartment. I haven't driven with them yet but have really liked using them with my computer monitor. If using these glasses is as expected while driving it will be a 5 Star rating.
4.0,I bought this to wear after surgery to avoid any constriction.  Works great and is very comfortable.  I really like the length as just covers my knees.  I have washed it a couple of times in the washing machine but do not put it in the dryer.  It comes out great.  I would buy this brand again.
4.0,"I CAN BREATH!! The only downside is it's a bit uncomfortable but after the first use, you don't notice it."
4.0,"I am 5’8 1/2, I wear between a 10 and a 12 depending on the material and cut. I purchased a medium and it’s a nice fit. The slip inside the dress is a little short and some of the sequence have fallen off (a few) and the dress is itchy but overall it’s pretty and I can’t wait to wear it out."
4.0,"Fits like a dream (Medium, 5'10, 125-145lbs) out of the box, but may shrink upon drying-- DO NOT TUMBLE DRY if you want it to stay the same size.  In my photo, it shows as orange, but I can assure it that it's HOT pink.  (Unlike another jumpsuit I bought that was Pink Salmon in the photo but turned out to be Tangerine Orange--Espiral brand).  The fabric is a bit scratchy/itchy at the seams, but breathable.  The included belt is OK.  I'm a bit busty, so with or without bra, I leave the top button undone. No bra in photo."
4.0,"I must admit I really bought this just to see.  It says &#34;Pandora&#34; on the product and at the price I did not believe it.  I seriously doubt it is Pandora.  But, it does come in a nice pandora box.  The silver color is closer to the look of aluminum foil not silver.  But it is pretty. It is very light weight.  I have worn it and it is really inexpensive.  Just a heads up - husband's don't buy this for your wife thinking it is a real pandora product.  But, it is great for a little gift for the nieces or if you have an outfit that matches it and you don't care if it is cheap costume jewelry."
4.0,Love the shirt just wasnt as dark red as the picture shows it is a bit brighter
4.0,"I like the shape on pure aesthetics but it would be nice if there was the slight curve to the face. These are straight so LOTS of light comes in from the side. The other disappointment was the color of the frame. The picture must have a bit of back lighting to brighten up the variation in the color. It is much darker overall. If that’s your thing, great, but I was looking for that distinct contrast as it was shown. I’ll keep them as I stated in the title, for polarized sunglasses, the price is great."
4.0,"I ordered this sweater because I liked the details on the sleeves...just something different from a plain cardigan.  I was very surprised at how nice the quality is when it arrived.  I've ordered similar sweaters before and they are thin and disappointing when they arrive.  This sweater is nice and thick and the pom pom details are nicely sewn on to the sweater.  My only complaint and the reason I took off a star is that the details on the sleeve are very tight around the forearm area, kind of like a rubberband going over your arm.  I ordered the largest size and I don't consider my arms to be thick.  If you don't mind the sweater itself being a little baggy, I would order a size up so that your arms are squeezed when you put it on.  I still really like this sweater and will continue to wear it and hope it stretches in the arm area.  I get so many compliments when I do wear it!"
4.0,I recently bought a hat online that was a little big this worked pretty good to adjust it. Comfortable as well
4.0,I brought the one buckle very classy look absolutely great on my feet absolutely love my shoes looks and feels great if you're not used to wearing heels definitely wear some slippers if you're planning on Dancing but the look is so classy and tasteful and elegant absolutely loved it smashing brought my New Year's in great with these shoes❤ also I normally wear a size 10 and I got a size 10 Perfect Fit exactly sorry I didn't get a better picture
4.0,Fine but breaks easy
4.0,Nice style and comfortable but had to order the next size up
4.0,"Comfy, light weight, flattering and stretchy great for the price. I would bug it again. Rated it 4 instead of 5 star because I’ve washed it about a dozen times now and the color as faded quite a bit but I’d still but it again."
4.0,La calidad es buenísima. El tamaño un poco grande
4.0,"I ordered a size M and it fit very very true to size. Good stretch, a little compressive at the waist, and hit on my about at a 7/8 length, but I’m 5’7” and most leggings tend to. The color is very pretty and exactly as expected from the pictures. This color was a little bit not squat proof (pictured), but not bad enough to stop me from wearing them on a leg day. Definitely not sweat proof and got a tiny bit of a ct, but not enough of either to not like the legging. My only hesitation is the material. It’s not bad at all! But it is the kind of material that gets a little shiny as it stretches and it snagged on something a little the first time I wore them, but I just took a lighter to the little piece sticking out lol.<br /><br />Overall, solid legging. It has its things, but better than you’d expect for the price! Not what I would go to if I wanted high high quality, but if you’re looking for leggings and don’t wanna pay $50 pair, these are an awesome choice. Will eventually be ordering more colors to try!"
4.0,"Nice quality briefs! They are not thin like other brands and they have a soft feel to them. 5 packs of the bikini brief underwear come in this pack with different colors: gray with yellow color design, white with green color design, black with red color, blue with orange and gray with blue color. They run a little on the small side. I ordered large and hubby is usually a medium and they fit. I think it depends on hip size (hubby 38in and they fit him perfect).On the front, there is some extra room, but if you think you'll need a bigger size down in that area, I'd order up a size to be safe. The front area is thicker than the rest of the underwear. The waist is stretchy allowing for extra room for comfort. They are a mixture of cotton 95% and spandex 5% this is why I say order up a size in case. Inside each brief has a small white tag on the left side explaining material and size. This can be irritating to the skin, so my hubby ripped them out. The stitching on these were great. No loose threads or seams. These briefs are nicer than some other brands I have got for my partner. My personal opinion, I'd order up a size.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I received these at no cost in exchange for an honest and unbiased opinion."
4.0,"I ordered this dress in small, med and large just because of the reviews. My daughter kept the medium. The small was too tight under the one arm and the fabric is thin so if there’s too much stretch then you can see through it. The large was probably okay but she wanted it a little tighter around the bottom, and a bit shorter so she kept the medium. She is 5’2” and 135 lbs."
4.0,these are so cute but very heavy.
4.0,La tela es pesada pero elástica. Me gustó mucho y me sirvió para lactar perfectamente. Un poco largo para mí.
4.0,Little bigger than expected.  But nice.
4.0,I am 5’2 and 132 pounds. Got the medium. Good combo fabric and fit me snug. Love it for the look and price!
4.0,Easy to pack. Good  inexpensive travel raincoat
4.0,"Honestly it's cute and warm, but you have to size up for sure"
4.0,"The watch was delivered very promptly and met the specifications.  It is the low end of Casio's watches of this type and that suits me.  Make sure that you read the specifications, as this watch does not have ""dual time"" (for travelers) nor does it display the month, only the day of the week and the day (number) of the month. I am quite satisfied."
4.0,"I just can't wear fit & flare dresses, they look terrible on me. Drop waist dresses are great but are hard to find. This is super cute, the hem detail makes this a really nice LBD. I was expecting more of a cotton material but I don't mind the heavy weight synthetic. It has some stretch to it, drapes nicely and won't wrinkle. I also have long arms, the sleeves are actually the right length instead of being a hair too short. Really like it!"
4.0,"I like the material quite a bit, its a nice stretchy thick denim. The style is also great, nice coloring and tapering on the legs. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I think the sizing is off by quite a bit, these jeans were at least one size larger than listed. When comparing them to other varying brands of jeans these were consistently a lot larger. Consider ordering a size down or just slap on a belt because these are some pretty decent jeans."
4.0,"Great detail, only had for 2 days, hope the bad reviews don't happen as this ring is Bad ass"
4.0,"It is a very good option for summer... so comfortable. The fabric concerns me a little: it is very thin. I hope it does not impact durability, because i plan on wear it a lot."
4.0,Cute but ran big.
4.0,Unique Style.  Very Cool for Summer.
4.0,The colors are so vibrant!!!
4.0,"the outfit was adorable and exactly as pictured, but runs very small in terms of height. I'm 5'6"" and can usually buy right off the rack. this was extremely short in the torso and the leg length, so order accordingly."
4.0,These are great - they stick much better then the prevues batch I bought. I had to get a new phone so I needed a new set and I always get compliments on these.
4.0,It is okay look different from the picture.
4.0,"Names are pretty tiny, but good for the price!"
4.0,Cute top. The neck is larger than expected but the rest of it fits well.
4.0,"I bought the necklace with the 9"" length black cord ending in silver 2.25"" metal circles.  Like the size and modern look.  However the silver is shinier than expected from the photo."
4.0,"Cute case and good quality, but the height is too small for all of my sunglasses. Seems more for smaller sizes (ie: reading) or children's glasses."
4.0,I got this for my nephew  and he loves it!
4.0,"Great for gift, light material and will last for a little while but I will wear on occasion"
4.0,These are nice and fit as expected but are a little sheer.
4.0,wasnt the right size for the ring finger but he like it anyway.
4.0,"Great color and soft material, but you will need to wear a belt with it."
4.0,"I originally purchased this dress in a medium since others have said it runs small, but I ended up exchanging for a small (my normal size) because it felt just slightly too big. I’m 5’3 & 125 lbs for reference! The color is definitely more of a bright red in person, and while I was hoping for it to be exactly as shown here, the color is still nice. I will only be wearing 1 inch heels and the length is perfect, I don’t need to have it hemmed!"
4.0,"Necklaces are ok.  Arrived in a tangled mess.  I don't expect these will last forever, but I knew that buying a fed item"
4.0,"Nice, but small"
4.0,"Here is a good review for these. I first thought they were too big but washed them and dried them on hot and they were perfect. I got an XL. My waist is 36&#34;. If you have a 38&#34; waist, you will need a XXL. If you have a 33&#34; waistor less, you need a large. If you have huge thighs or legs, these are not for you. They are really comfortable and it's hard to find solid color boxers anymore. They are seconds because the Joseph Abboud patch is on the back, not the front. They come in 6 two packs, each marked $29.99. I wish they were thicker but for 12 pair, If I can get 2 years or more out of them, it's a heck of a deal. I highly recommend you buy these for the price. I also wish they had a button on the fly but not a big deal. If you are hard on boxers, buy 24 pair while they last. I have a bunch of other nice boxers so I am using 6 and saving six for later."
4.0,"I really like the patterns, but the top band was super tight on my thighs (15.25&#34; around).  I stretched it out with my hands as suggested on the packaging, but it only helped a little bit."
4.0,Fabric feels great but is kind of ugly. it looks great on though
4.0,Working with them
4.0,Smart and elegance was my first thought 3 different styles. Can go with JUST about everything i wear.
4.0,very good~~
4.0,Wearing these made me feel like I was enveloped in a cloud and I couldn't believe how well they fit!
4.0,It says selenite in the name of the product but there wasn’t any included. Otherwise decent box for $10. The tumbled quartz is yellowish but everything else is absolutely beautiful.
4.0,"The Chrome is cool.  They are very cheap though. They fell off my motorcycle<br />seat and the lenses scratched. Big bummer. But the chrome is like silver<br />mirrors. Love it.  If the lenses were scratch free, I'd pay more. Cuz, they look cool."
4.0,Smaller than depicted in the picture but nonetheless pretty cool and functional.
4.0,"I am pretty sure I just failed to see the dimensions, but these little parasols were party favors and a decor activity at my daughter's tea party themed birthday. They worked perfectly for the girls and allowed them to play with them inside with ease, due to the size being smaller than a traditional parasol - think American girl doll sized. Very sturdy and well made."
4.0,Very beautiful corset and well made. The only thing I wish was that it was better fitted. I first ordered a medium because the reviews said it ran large but the medium was to small. I returned it and ordered a large. The large fits but it's a little to large. With some slight alterations it will be perfect.
4.0,"Absolutely love the shirt. I am 5'9&#34;, 170 pounds. I ordered a large. The sleeves are a little short, and it fit in the bust as I am very flat chested, but right below the bit came out WAY too much. It is such a cool look, but I went to take it to a Taylor to get a few inches taken in. I like a very snug fit, to show my waist, so it originally came from being a little snug in the bus bust to HUGE below on. I want to order a few more, but I'm afraid if I get a medium the sleeves would be too short. Can anyone make any suggestions? Thank you"
4.0,"I’ve purchased two pairs of these sunglasses now, as I’m prone to losing them (oops). They’re pretty unbeatable for the price, however, I have had a repeatedly issue. The “K” on the side can come off, and tends to do so. I had it pop off after one small drop. Losing that is a bummer, especially since it’s a decent size and white. If I paid more for these glasses I would have reason to be upset, but since they’re so cheap you should expect they aren’t built to last. Worth the price, just be careful how much you actually knock them around."
4.0,nice and arrived fast
4.0,"This swimsuit is absolutely beautiful, and the material is nice quality! The reason I only gave this 4 stars is because the suit does run a bit small. I am 5’6 189lbs with a short torso, and the suit is cut too short. It still looks nice on imo."
4.0,I really like the looks of this ring!  I have large hands for a woman and this ring is large enough to look proportionate.  Love the skulls!  I have always had dreams of being a biker babe and this ring will be perfect when that happens!!!  LOL!!  The only thing I don't like is the back of the skulls that rest against my finger are kind of sharp.  If i ever catch the ring on anything it could cut my finger.....  I plan on being careful!  : )
4.0,"Very comfortable, extremely baggy and crotch hangs really low. 5'6 130 pds small"
4.0,"Comfy & warm! Does get bally after a few wears which I didn't expect for DKNY, but still cozy! Nice and long too - but not too long!"
4.0,"Its cute, extreamly warm and well made. The mittens seem to annoy my daughter though. They need buttons or velcro or something to hold them back bi might just cut them off because they seem to make her not want to wear the sweater."
4.0,"such a pretty dress, but as always, a little big and doesn’t fit exaaaactly how i’d like, is long i need heels for it, but i love it, i always struggle finding things that fit me because of my shape not much can flatter my body, most makes me look like a box. i’m 5’0 and 106 lbs, i wear xs/s, and my bra size is 34b. i am small but have a shape so it’s hard for me to fit many clothes properly. this is nice tho, it still fits well enough for me to wear and be pretty comfortable in 😌"
4.0,Only wish it wasn’t pleated.
4.0,These were big cute and trendy. Will not hurt your ears as they are light weight.
4.0,"I wear a 14 and I was right on the line between L and XL on the fit chart.  I am 5'4"" and the XL goes all the way to my knee and move around a bit when I work out.  I have other 8"" shorts and these are definitely longer.  They are SO soft and haven't lost that feel even though I have washed them.  They do look good on and I really like the blue camo.  I am bigger in the tummy area and they do NOT roll under so that is nice."
4.0,I love this dress... the middle is a little odd... but no one really notices
4.0,Love it except it didn't have pockets on pants. Every man would like them to put wallet and keys and money in them wearing out
4.0,I'm wearing this dress right now. I've worn it several times since I purchased it. I've not put it in the dryer. The waist is a bit higher on me than I would REALLY like but it's not bad enough of a difference to make it look ill fitting.
4.0,"Loved these, only 4 stars because one of the nose pieces fell off after only about 4 weeks of having them"
4.0,"I am 5""2"", 191lbs and a little curvy.  Based off the reviews, I originally ordered the Large but the pants were way too tight but the top fit good.  I exchanged for the XXL.  The XXL pants fit perfectly but the top feels too big for the pants.  I understand that the top is supposed to be bigger but these tops don't seem to be proportionate to the pants size.  The Large or XL top would have been perfect with the XXL pants.  I decided to keep the XXL set though.  It is of good quality, material feels great and the pants cling in all of the right places."
4.0,Beautiful and fun! New it was large but wow bigger than I expected.
4.0,"Love the feeling of the sweater, great quality. Super cute but the color was definitely more of an orange than a beige or brown. Would order in more colors !"
4.0,Bright color and decent material!
4.0,Liked them but not happy with fit.
4.0,bought these for my husband likes them they are warm and soft. wears them everyday.
4.0,"This sweater is very flattering.  However, by no stretch of the imagination is this navy in color.  it is a very pretty dark blue/green.  Although I specifically  wanted a navy sweater, I am going to keep it as this color is great."
4.0,Very nice. Perfectly fits me with size xs.
4.0,It could fit better or be adjustable.
4.0,This is perfect and I get a lot of compliments on it. I just wish it had a small space for coins.
4.0,I've been needing a new set of these and they are just perfect. Size is small in comparison to my other earrings and provides a much needed shift from my norm.
4.0,"Overall- for $26 these are comfy and the material seems to be quality especially compared to the name brand for $60. However, extremeeeely see through (like you cant wear underwear at all even the seamless show through) and the waist folds over and scrunches which is really annoying. The color was a little more washed out in the pink than I expected but like I said for $26 I am content and they shipped fast. I usually would get medium, 5ft 135 lb but small fits perfectly except for the material folding over. If it weren't quarantine I would maybe return or exchange for a different color because I definitely can't wear these out of the house. So just adjust your expectations for the low price otherwise splurge on the name brand."
4.0,The product was OK and it's looks elegant I like it..
4.0,"They are so very cute!  He and his parents love them but they don't squeak his every move.  Maybe the second or third.  He is a big boy for his age and was walking early (6-1/2) months, so he has a heavy tread.  His feet are growing fast so I am going to buy him the next size up in the same style so he'll have them through the summer months.  A proud Aunt."
4.0,"Bought for college students and they loved them, they are using them to hold hair ties on wrist. They loved them."
4.0,"Order 1-2 sizes up! well made and super cute, however."
4.0,Bought this for my fiance so she can carry her gun with her. Bag is made very well and has been holoding up for some time now. She loves it. Is not built like a cheap purse. Highly reccomend it.
4.0,Too bad we didn't get that much snow.....
4.0,funny product.
4.0,I purchased this wallet in red in case I drop it...I like the open facing ID instead of having to take my DL out everytime...
4.0,These are very pretty and look just like their pictures. I have sensitive ears so I can only wear them for a few hours or so but they are great for a party. Wish the back wasn't plastic. I recieved this at a discounted price for reviewing it.
4.0,Fits as expected and I'm overall happy with the purchase. It got a little weird after I washed it. I washed in cold and didn't dry it but the fabric got quite stiff and hangs funny now. Not sure if that could be remedied by washing differently but I'll still continue to wear it.
4.0,"This dress fit me perfectly. I’m 5”3” and fluctuate between 105-110lbs. The dress was just right. I specifically purchased it because I’m breast feeding and the front zipper made it very easy to do that, without being an obvious and specific breast feeding dress. The only reason I gave it four stars and not five, is because it’s not the greatest quality made item."
4.0,These are beautiful earrings! Super light! My only complaint is that they do not come with backs and you need them or they will fall out. I've experienced that.  Thankfully I didn't lose the earring!  Thank you!
4.0,"A bit too shiny for my liking, but great length and good quality"
4.0,"Soft, light and beautiful.  Wish the arm straps were a bit longer to fit over a winter coat sleeve, but otherwise it's great.  Lots of compliments."
4.0,Cute and the length is nice and long
4.0,I got 25 pink butterflies! I also received a yellow one and one of the pink ones came broken. The color of pink is a little different than the picture. More salmon pink than the soft pink I expected.
4.0,The sizing was good but the hole that you put your head through seem to be a bit small. I do like that the shirt is sheer but with good quality. Also a major plus is that it’s only half a shirt or a midriff shirt so at least whatever you’re wearing it’s not bulky under your clothes if you’re wearing it under a dress or a shirt
4.0,I love the style of the dress and fit. It is a little thin. But I love the blue color it came in. The thinner material will make it easier to wear in more than one season.
4.0,Purse larger than described in the ad. But it was a beautiful good quality purse.
4.0,"Cute alone or with leggings, this is the perfect look-cute-but-stay-comfortable dress!"
4.0,It fits and feels nice. Seams are straight and tight. The material is a little thinner than I expected. That makes it light and cool but time will tell if it holds up.
4.0,"I love hummingbirds, so when I saw this I wanted to get it, very cute set"
4.0,Feels good to wear! Good product!
4.0,Like the wallet n color. But I keep dropping my change.
4.0,Very good looking shoes. The pair I got is slightly too tight but I'm wearing them to hopefully stretch them out.  The left is tighter than the right. Classy!
4.0,"I needed about 4 Triglide buckles to mount a travel bag on the back of my motorcycle. I purchased a 100 count for close to the same price a purchasing a dozen. Shipping was fast, the items were packaged nicely. The only problem with Triglide buckles is they are difficult to tighten firmly just pulling on the synch strap. I was able to overcome but is my only reason for not giving 5 stars."
4.0,"This is the second time I have purchased this dress from two different sellers.  I use them as a bathing suit cover up and they stand up to regular washing. I recommend machine washing in cold water to maintain the color and air dry to maintain the size. They are both the same and both wear well. The fit is as expected, I am a size 8-10 and weigh 125lbs and I bought a medium."
4.0,"I love these, I purchased as quick slip-ins for school drop off in the AM. They are warm and comfortable, On really cold and snowy days I had to wear with socks/thicker socks because my toes were a little cold. My only dislike and reason for knocking a star is because they are a bit bulky looking. Definitely not the most attractive looking shoe but I still wear them all the time and the warm slip in convenience makes it worth it"
4.0,Got this wig for my eventual princess tutu cosplay. be warned that when they say that this wig is orange it is FLAMBOYANTLY SO. It also looks nothing like the one in the picture (as it is a sprightly shade of Neon versus this nice carrot orange in the picture) of course i assume it has to be styled to be similar shaped to the one in the picture so that is not too bad i suppose.<br /><br />It did come with a wig cap so that was nice. The wig feels really nice and soft so I can certainly appreciate that.<br /><br />Would have been five stars had the color not been Neon Rainbow Orange.
4.0,"I absolutely loved this watch band, I could wait to wear it but unfortunately it is to big for my wrist but I would recommend anyone with bigger wrist to get this product. It is amazing quality and very easy to put on the watch."
4.0,"I LOVE THE COLOR! I ordered this in XL and it fits pretty nice. I'm a size 14 and typically wear 1X/XL. The material of the dress is pretty thin, but it covers everything for me, haha."
4.0,"If had this keychain for 6 months as of now. Functionality is superb as stated in description. My remote fits perfect and is secure, no need to worry about losing it. I was able to place my house key along with it. The only issue I have is the finish didn't hold up as illustrated. Overall it's a great looking keychain and I would definitely recommend this product."
4.0,It’s an okay pair of pants! Runs small. Material so so.
4.0,My daughter wanted to give it to a friend.  She really loved it!!
4.0,"Dress fit perfectly, well worth for the money"
4.0,Love the colors and very soft fabric.
4.0,The dress came in a very timely manner and vey beautiful design it was just a little bit snug fitting. I will order from this company again!!!!!👌😊<br />Thanks<br />Kathleen
4.0,great for decorating onesies for a baby shower
4.0,"I love that it's reversible.  It looks good on both sides. The only thing that would make it better would be at least one outside pocket for keys, phone, sunglasses."
4.0,This is a really nice watch. It is made a little thinner than my husband would like to work in but would be perfect for just dress or anything not job related.
4.0,"Not too heavy, not too light. Just right!"
4.0,Le encanto a mi esposa
4.0,"The sound quality isn’t as good as I thought it would be. The bass of most songs isn’t entirely audible, but eh.. I’m not complaining. It made me the coolest person in school and at work when I wear it. Plus it’s a nice looking accessory, so.. I can’t complain :D"
4.0,"A cute, funky, and unexpected accessory that gets me a compliment guaranteed every time I wear it. I like wearing it with jeans and a plain shirt, in a 'I woke up like this' way :)"
4.0,Great tie...I wear  it all the time.  Nice quality.
4.0,Everything about the color was awesome 👏
4.0,"I bought this as a Christmas gift so I can't say yet how it fits.  It looks a bit short, but we'll see.  The fabric is nice, soft and comfy, and it looks as though it will flow nicely when worn.  I find the pattern does not pop as much as I expected it would (probably because the grey background is somewhat darker than it appears in the pictures on the website), but overall the dress looks cute and if it fits well, it will become a go-to dress for playdates, I would think. if there is any issue with washing and drying or the fit, I will update this review."
4.0,"I was wearing Thor's helmet with the CZ studs every day and after a couple weeks, the post on one of the helmets is coming loose. while I know it's more of a costume jewelry type thing, I was hoping they would hold up longer than a few weeks. Loki's daggers are so big they don't work very well if you have your ears double pierced like myself, although with some fidgeting you can make them work with the small studs. all in all it's a pretty awesome set, just wish it was more durable"
4.0,"It's a one size, high quality hat that I haven't seen in the stores. The raised embroidered M on the front is outlined in bright colors and looks great. I'd definitely buy it again."
4.0,"I’ve had this dress for a month. I have worn it twice and washed it three times. It has been washed on the gentle cycle on been dried flat, but this material isn’t going to last. It’s already fading. From a distance, it looks great, but when I look down on it as I am wearing it, the top looks like the black lines are fuzzing into the white. The bottom portion of the dress, looks great from a distance, but again, when I look down upon it it looks grayish and fuzzy when it should look black. The bust fits good, but the wait is wide. I like the dress but have no plans to reorder because of the fuzzy/fading fabric. I will wear it until it’s too faded, because it’s too late return. Overall, while the dress is cute and flattering, but the material is a big disappointment."
4.0,It wasn’t as vibrant as the color detected in the pictures.  It is definitely something to wear around the house for comfy.  The length runs short.  I purchased a large.
4.0,"I like them. They're made well and fit perfectly, but I didn't realize they were going to be fake coach.. Almost identical to the real ones though, so I'm gonna keep them."
4.0,These are well made and seem comfortable.
4.0,The  cell phone case is very nice perfect for what I needed. The color matches a hand bag I have.
4.0,"It fits as expected but slightly snug, you wouldn't need to order a size up unless you want it a little baggy.<br />It's really cute casual or dressed up but the fabric makes it feel like you could totally wear it as a normal day dress or business dress, very versatile.<br />She loves the scoop neck and it feels perfectly where it's not too revealing.<br />The sleeve length is great as well.<br /><br />The color is a little darker than the product picture shows but it's pretty close."
4.0,still working well.
4.0,"The products look cheaper than they are in the picture, but I guess thats what you get for the price, and the earrings had a really bad smell at first.  I had to leave them out for a few days before I could wear them.  They look pretty though."
4.0,"I love it! It's flexible. It's not too big as I had feared it would be, and it goes great with my skin tone! I haven't worn it yet so until I receive compliments I'll give it four stars."
4.0,"Snug fit but very comfortable, wish they were available in 1/2 sizes"
4.0,"My almost 8 year old daughter recently had a major growth spurt and grew out of all her leggings.<br />She's tall and thin; most leggings are the right length, but too wide at the top making them loose around her hips. These are both smaller around the hips AND the right length. They are a thicker material than other leggings, but still soft and stretchy with quality stitching and cute prints.  I would recommend and buy these again."
4.0,Fits good. I'm normally an XL in dresses and ordered XL so pretty true to size. Wasnt expecting the kinda shiny material though. I'm 5'2.5 so I have to wear something with a little heal or it's too long.
4.0,Don’t use for work gets dirty quick
4.0,"Nice sweatshirt, love the colors, soft material. But it runs a little small. I ordered a Large and it fits like a Medium. It’s snug. I’m 5’9” 135. Should’ve gotten an XL but don’t plan on returning."
4.0,"Read a comment here that they run large, so  I bought a medium instead of large. The medium is a bit snug on me and I can't wear it as a second layer comfortably. The sweatshirt itself is good quality and a nice weight material. I'll buy a couple of large sizes next fall."
4.0,Looks good and fits well. Missing an inside pocket though.
4.0,"I received this item in a size large for my boyfriend who weighs around 210 lbs and wears a 34 in pants.<br />They are your basic, cotton boxer briefs with a nice stretchy waistband. The only issue he has is they sit pretty low in the backside. If you're a guy who is really into low rise jeans/pants then these are very much up your alley. For those who prefer a slightly higher rise, these can be annoying in that you constantly feel the need to pull them up. Plus, any sort of bending is going to lead to a major case of plumber's crack.<br />Other than that, this is a good quality product and a terrific value."
4.0,"was exactly what i ordered, and i got it in a timely manner, unfortunately the pair are one size tooo small.  i need to get the xxl size and i cant find them on the sellers website."
4.0,"I have 4 JollieLovin tops. I love them all.  The fabric is very nice and the quality is good.  I am going to have to fix this one though.  Fabric got caught in the sleeve seam but since I sew, I can easily fix it.  Would like to have more pretty, smaller print choices."
4.0,I bought this for my daughter.  It is so cute.  She loves it.  A new purchase so hasn't been washed yet.
4.0,"Consistency on sizing and garment quality has become a problem. Jetlag has been in my closet for years. I purchase 3-4 pair of shorts yearly. This year so far 1 pair.  Why ?  Don't know what I'm getting -- Fit - quality - or actual product..  I believe maybe even closeouts or 2nd knock offs.. Don't return goods just don't buy brand much.. Shorts, pullovers, long pants were my main purchases."
4.0,Very impressed.  The sound quality is good not overly load but load enough that I don't have it on full volume all the time.  Very warm hat. To warm to wear inside. Will be ordering more of them.
4.0,"I usually wear a medium, sometimes a small.  I could not even zip the medium all the way up.  Reordered in a large and it fits perfectly.  The band at the empire waist has no stretch so this may be why I needed to size up.  I got the dress in white and it is pretty but I definitely need to wear a nude bra and nude shape wear on the bottom.  Overall good for the price."
4.0,"Very sparklie and just the right size so I can wear them year round, not just at Christmas."
4.0,[[ASIN:B00VDSINO8 S925 Sterling Silver &#34;My Sister My Friend&#34; Open Circle Pendant 18&#34; Necklace]]<br />Got this for my sister for a gift. It is nice but the words are just a  a little difficult to read. She loves it.
4.0,These are very nice! I'm very happy.<br /><br />I do recommend this product!
4.0,Not fuzzy inside though
4.0,Little bigger than i expected but thats ok.  I still like it.
4.0,They look good and feel good
4.0,"These are very nice panties and I bought a size up as recommended. I wear size 6 but ordered a Large. It's okay, but a size XL would probably be better."
4.0,"Fits likes a junior dress, not a women's so order big! Super cozy, a little thin, but can't complain too much for the price. I am 5 ft 8 in tall and it is a little short."
4.0,It was a Christmas gift for one of the family Softballer's.  She really enjoyed it.
4.0,"Well made shirt, very nice fabric"
4.0,From the picture it’s not noticeable that the arms are sheer and polka dot. I’m not a polka dot fan but the shirt fit very nicely otherwise. A great value especially if you’re okay with polka dots
4.0,"Was so pleased with them, I ordered a second time.  Ease of use and storage."
4.0,Super comfy and cute. Better than I expected but the cups are a little smaller than I'd like them to be. Other than that the rest of it fits as I expected.
4.0,"I like this apron but it’s considerably longer than the photo, midcalf on me (5’3”)."
4.0,really like these shoes they are super comfy. the bonus is that they don't fall off.
4.0,"Loved the bathing suit.  I bought a size larger and glad I did.  However, the top was a little big.  I had to  use some inserts and worked fine."
4.0,Fits a little big but it’s really cute and professional
4.0,"We ordered a 5 pack of Mater and Lightening McQueen socks (2 Mater, 3 Lightening McQueen) like in the picture posted for the product. Instead, we received a 6 pack of mixed Cars socks - 1 Lightening McQueen, 1 Piston Cup, 1 yellow racecar, 1 checkered flag, 1 grey racecar, and 1 Mater. Thankfully there was at least 1 Mater and 1 Lightening McQueen since that was all my son wanted, but we could have done without the others. There were no sizes listed on the tag, so I had to measure the socks with a tape measure prior to cutting the tag off to make sure that we received the correct size. My sons feet are 6"" length and there's a little extra room for expansion, so hopefully they'll still fit after washing them. For now, they are soft and appear to fit well. There is 1 sock (navy sock with yellow racecar) that has a bunch of strings around the ankle of the sock, but otherwise they appear to be a decent product."
4.0,Comfy and cute! The pockets are awesome and vwry functional. It is pretty short...just under your tush. Has had a little wear from washing after only a couple Washes which is why only four stars.
4.0,Great shoes but run a full size too small for my son's feet.
4.0,"Nice fit, I purchased a small size, I'm 5'1"", 114lb. I made the mistake to put it in the washer and dryer and it shrunk. Still fits, but it is shorter in length now. I wore it to work with a cardigan on."
4.0,"Overall I’d get this again and size up for a baggy fit. It’s thinner than I would have expected but it’s still pretty soft and cozy. I love the green tie dye; it looks darker in person than it does on amazon. The fit is a bit small in my opinion. I ordered my normal size , Medium and it fits me a bit tighter and shorter than on the model. I’m 5’5 and have a 36D bust for reference."
4.0,I liked the top. Good quality. I'm just returning it for the next size up.
4.0,Nice backpack. Well made. Lots of pockets. Only problem was I ordered black but they sent a green one.
4.0,Dress was purchased for my daughter who is quite small.  It fit well except was extremely narrow in the hips and doesn't give her room to move much.
4.0,"Hi, great quality!  I bought this for the color and the design.  Design is excellent, quality, was going to use it every day!  I may be a woman but I believe this bag is unisex.  However, I have to return it because I spent $350 on a wallet, purse and shoes to match the color.  Had the color been anything like the picture I would have jumped for joy!  The first picture is what I ordered, the second is what I received.  Can't do it...won't match anything I own.  Contacting the owners. If I can get the correct color, I'll be back raving about the company and the product!"
4.0,"The dress fit perfectly. I have worn it for some time, and it has held up well. It does pill, but overall, it is a nice dress for the price. Would buy again."
4.0,"Wore this to a Halloween party and then with a group of adults with similar costumes while trick-or-treating with the children..  Mine had two blower motors, versus one, like some of the others.  Grandchildren loved that Mimi had her own costume.  Carry backup batteries if you plan to wear over 2 hours."
4.0,"Wonderful sweatshirt, just not my son's absolute favorite."
4.0,"The dress is a nice, thick stretch fabric, so it's very forgiving! My issue (like several others) is the neckline is very deep and not overly kind to those of us without a large chest. I'm a D cup and feel overly exposed and like I don't fill it out enough! That being said, I would buy this again in another color if I can figure out how to cover.<br />Dress is about knee-length on me at 5' 7&#34;."
4.0,Seems to be warm.
4.0,"I bought these to replace broken overall hooks. I knew I'd probably need some more in the future so I bought this pack. They came loose in a plastic pouch. The hooks feel lighter weight compared to the original hardware I had, they're also slighlty narrower than I expected. I was able to use them as replacements just fine and they actually hold onto the buttons better than my original hooks. I'm hoping they hold up well through the washer and dryer. Overall I'm happy with the product and would recommend them. I would give 5 stars if the metal felt more heavy duty."
4.0,"Fast shipping and very cute!  Problem, it does not say that the band is NOT connected when you get it!  It is not hard to put together but......"
4.0,Fit right. Good color
4.0,"These are nice yoga/exercise pants. The material is stretchy, but comfortable and I love the little pocket, perfect to hold your keys. Unfortunately the cut is very strange. They are tightest around the calves (my calves are not large) looser around the thighs and hips (my thighs are large) and basically the same width around the waist as around the hips, which not a common body type at all, so the waist is super big. I think in general they are cut large for exercise clothes. I normally wore a medium (occasionally a small in exercise gear) at 5'7"" 145 lbs, but I've gained quite a bit of weight and at 165 I figured I should move up to a large. Well, that was not a great idea because these larges are just so large in the waist that I can't wear them without them falling down. I wish there were a drawstring on the waist. If I could tighten the waist, I would totally wear them for light exercise. But I can't.. they will literally fall off of me.<br /><br />So overall, I do like these pants. I'm just disappointed I can't wear them. I highly recommend buying down a size. The material is such that I think something too small wouldn't be terribly uncomfortable and it seems more likely that a size lower than your typical size will fit just right."
4.0,"I read all the reviews before ordering a size up than I usually would. I've ordered beach cocos regular dresses before and they do tend to be a little smaller but nothing like what some of the reviews said. I am usually a 12 on bottom and a 10 on top, I'm 5'7 and do not have a large chest as some people were saying. I ordered an extra large and it's actually a little large in the boobs, but I put a strapless bra on and it's fine. I also do not find the material to be that thin. The description says it's jersey/rayon and it is as I expected. For the price especially, this is perfect for the wedding I am attending this month. It is very flattering for the belly too. I got this in olive. Hope this helps as I had a hard time determining what to get based on a lot of people's complaints of the chest size."
4.0,Like the product but not what I expected.<br />I thought this needed to be put together but there'll ready together. Had one post broken and one earring was missing and another was  blank with nothing on it.
4.0,"So far I’ve only used two of the septum rings. They fit well on me, not too big, not too smal, but great. Only thing after a while color will change from it’s pretty state 😞. Especially on the first model with the opal. The top part changed color to dull after two months. I’ve used alcohol to clean irregardless, but didn’t make a difference. No allergic reaction, redness or itching from it, so that’s good. The second model is what I’m currently using, so far so good!"
4.0,This made for a quick costume for a party. It came with all the essentials. Everything was pretty cheaply made but that's a given for the low cost. Pretty basic but comes in handy if you really need it!
4.0,The wife loves it when I show my long legs and these 6&#34; shorts show lots. If you ladies like my comment I'll post some pics ;).<br /><br />Waist is snug for a 33&#34;. Fabric and color are nice.
4.0,Lightweight material.  But definitely wide leg pants.  I'm only 5'1&#34;. I think they'd look better on someone taller.  I ended up returning them.
4.0,My 9 year old surprised me with this sweet necklace.  Decent quality for the price!
4.0,I am 5’8 weigh 131 usually I am between a small/medium. Ordered a large & very pleased by the fit. For the price I am very pleased with this purchase.
4.0,"Love them make me look cute, i workout so I have big thighs, but these hug my thighs and waist snugly"
4.0,"Nice, stylish case, very sturdy and well built.  It's just a touch narrow and the glasses I intended it for don't quite fit. the interior width is *just* 2 inches. Seems like the temples of my glasses are a bit longer than normal and while they are flexible I don't want to force them into the case.  I will keep it for another pair of glasses that I have that fit in there - just a little rearranging and all is well."
4.0,I like it for the most part the only problem is that it feels weird when you rub it. I don’t know how to explain it but the material feels weird when you rub your hand up and down kinda like going against the grain if that makes sense. Feels like a cats tongue. If that makes sense
4.0,Its going to be a good addition to my 8 year old's Halloween costume this year.  It worked right away and was very full and bouncy.
4.0,"could've been longer, I'm 5'6&#34; but long legs, therefore that's my problem, but great product overall, above my ankle length on me."
4.0,"The gloves are of a nice quality and are warm. The stitching for the touch screen works, but is imprecise. It is a glove after all. I bought them for a driving glove and they do a good job of gripping the steering wheel. I bumped one star off because they have tags inside the glove that stratch the side of my hand. I cut them out, but the rements still stratch."
4.0,There are only 5 belt loops on the size 40 shorts. this is common on a lot of inexpensive men's pants. I would give these these 5 stars if they had 2 more loops.
4.0,"Very cute , although one had a lot of visible glue on it . Otherwise , nice earrings for price"
4.0,This was bought as a Halloween costume add on. Also bought hoping it would be a nice quality vest for the rest of the year. The material is thick and warm feeling. Overall satisfied with purchase.
4.0,I really loved this dress. It looked beautiful all night. I think it fit me really well. My only issue was the shoulders kept sliding up since it’s an off the shoulder Dress but I looked up a hack and it worked well. I took off 1 star because I wore this dress ONE TIME and it ripped in the back towards the end of my night. It did not snag on Anything it was from bending down once. Very disappointed I can’t wear this again.
4.0,Taller than 171/2 inches. Runs quietly but a bit too tall for my countertop.. Cooling well.
4.0,The necklace served its purpose for family photos
4.0,"I love this style and am wearing this sweatshirt a lot! The zipper is cheap, harder to use, and I fear it will break…so i intentional don’t unzip and simply take out off over my head most of the time.  A minor inconvenience to hopefully keep the sweatshirt longer!"
4.0,Although it barely fits I LOVE IT! Super sexy coverup. I'm only 5ft 4in and it JUST COVERS
4.0,"This is somewhat expensive for a tiny charm, but it's cute and made a good gift."
4.0,"So funny, one day I was struggling with those no-show socks in my dress shoes and thought if there were only a way to just cover my toes I wouldn't have to worry about these slipping down and bunching up under my arches. Then I thought, let me check Amazon! They have everything. Low and behold...I found them! Thank you! I love them. They stay in place. They seem to hold up pretty well. Been using them for a few months now. The only thing is they are a little tight around my heel but not intolerable. I wear and 8 1/2 wide. Not sure I would like them if my foot was much bigger. My daughter wears a 6 and fit her just fine."
4.0,"Very nice pendants, but the description does not show exactly how small the are . They are just slightly bigger than a nickel, appears to much larger than that."
4.0,Not super comfortable right away but that is to be expected.  Looking at the construction I am sure they will break in nice.
4.0,"Costume was super cute, but the headband was broken 😕"
4.0,Doesn’t fit as loose as it looks in the pic<br />Great color good quality - might buy a size up
4.0,"I'm pretty pleased with this pj set! I'm a pretty solid in-between-sizes lady (medium and large) so I'm very glad I read the other reviews and went with the large. I'm usually a medium on top but large on bottom, so more times than not I have to opt for the large size if I'm buying shorts, a dress, or pj set. If I wanted a baggier fit I could've even gone with the XL. The shorts accommodate someone with big thighs like me so I'm pretty happy about that, but if you do have bigger thighs please note that there won't be as much room like there is on the model once they're on."
4.0,"these earrings were alright for the price, although obviously cheaper build upon closer inspection.<br />good enough shine, everything was straight and clear.<br />I did not like the size however, I returned this size and got the next size down."
4.0,"I like how thin it is. However, I am unable to wear it because it is too small."
4.0,Very cute dress. It just wasn't for my body type so I returned.
4.0,"I want to be clear - if you read the description, you're getting what you are expecting.  It looks like genitalia wedged inside a mollusk, and you look out through a vertical slit where you expect genitalia to have a slit.<br /><br />In fact, the product looks more horrible than you expect for the reasons you wanted.<br />I felt guilty about wearing around my friends, which is saying much."
4.0,The color showing on my phone and what arrived but I can't blame them for my phone. Soft shirt but thinner than I'd like.
4.0,"I like the bathing suit, it's really cute. I am usually a medium but that turned out to be too tight (5'2, 125 lbs). I plan to re-order a large. But the suit is still nice and the design is so cute!"
4.0,Love this hoodie but it somewhat gets dirty easily. Probably cause it's yellow. But still worth the buy!
4.0,"I like the concept!  This one is a little bulky for my wrist.  It doesn't conform to my wrist because the zipper and material are too stiff.  The zipper pull also sticks out and is very annoying.  I will still use it, however I was hoping for better quality."
4.0,"Me gusta el diseño, pero el material parece de buzo de colegio , pensé que sería un material mejor. Pero fuera de eso esga hermoso"
4.0,I liked the fit for the most part but the bust was a bit lose and I felt very exposed. Just FYI for those not looking for their boobs to be served as well as diner. 🙂
4.0,"Really cute, especially for the price. A little dress up for the shelter-at-home."
4.0,"Se ve elegante sin embargo no es cuero original, además la imagen que muestran en la venta realmente no corresponde al producto que al final te envían, tanto en calidad como en Color.<br />Realmente me esperaba algo mejor ya que eso es lo que dice el producto “cuero original” pero no lo es.<br /><br />Estoy editando mi comentario anterior, pues tengo 2 años con esta correa y si es cuero original, envejece muy bien!! Recomendado 100%"
4.0,Didn’t love the fit on this one- I’m a little curvier and it definitely hugged all the wrong places. I kept it in hopes of being to wear it with leggings or something for the holidays. If you’re secure with your body shape I’d say go for it!
4.0,"Pro: The silver box packaging was excellent! It's ready to be given as a gift right out of the Amazon box.<br />Con: The detail work on the crucifix is pretty decent, but the metal used is very lightweight and doesn't feel like it is very high quality. Also the space in between decades could be a bit longer; sometimes it's difficult to feel when a decade ends and I have to open my eyes to check.<br />I would gladly play $12-15 USD for this rosary and use it as a backup. It's very very nice but now that I have held it in my hands I don't plan on using it as my primary rosary.<br />It's a great option, but even better options exist at this price point."
4.0,"I was hoping shirt was a little bit bigger so my grandson will grow into it, my daughter is scared to wash and dry it because she knows it will shrink up. But it has to be washed soooo oh well. It is a really cute shirt though."
4.0,Good enough i love them
4.0,Great fit meet my expectation
4.0,"I love having shorts under my skirt. The pockets are a BIG plus! One thing I added was a clasp to hold the elastic waste part.l, as it had no way to stay tighter on my waste without it."
4.0,Love both so much!! The choker is a little bit tighter than expected but luckily I have a small neck so it sits right above my collarbone. The pearls are quite big but do not look excessively big. In love with this set would totally recommend!
4.0,It's short but it's sexy as hell!
4.0,"I'm 5'3"", 138 pounds, 36F, short torso with longer legs, apple-shaped so I carry all my weight from my stomach and above, no hips, thighs, backside, with slim legs and ankles. I ordered an XL and it fits just right, form-fitting without showing bulges from my bra band. The material hangs nicely and I have room in the sleeves, but I have smaller arms and shoulders. The length of the dress hits me mid-knee. If you're pear-shaped, then you could probably go with your true size, if you're apple-shaped then I'd say order a size up unless you like the look of your bra band bulging out on your back and sides."
4.0,Me agrado la tela bonito lastima que muy pequeño para la talla pedida .. hay que pedir una extra ala que es uno ..
4.0,"Socks were as described. Super soft and fuzzy, with cute Christmas designs!"
4.0,"Loved the colors of this dress! It’s very comfortable and I used it during my pregnancy. It made for great maternity pics, the only negative is the length but I’m also a short girl."
4.0,"I like this bra. It's not perfect but it fits okay and does the job. I think a bra makes an outfit, if you don't feel good in your bra, you're not going to feel good about what you're wearing. This doesn't have much lift, doesn't give a lot of shape. It's just a nice bra. Nice --- not great, wonderful, perfect--- just nice."
4.0,"Very soft with stretchy material. Pick a size up, because they are a smaller fit."
4.0,"These boots are more comfortable then I thought they would be.  I got the leathery looking ones and am happy with how they look.  They have a little stretchy area hiding behind a seam making it easy for you to slip on and off.  I thought the hidden seam was for a zipper but it’s  not.  I have super skinny legs so they are wide for me so I do have to wear thick socks but that’s just skinny leg problems.  The boots run about a 3rd of the way up to my knees (a little higher than I thought they would but I’m not complaining).  They are the kind of boots that make noise against hard surfaces when you walk but it’s not super loud.  Overall, I’m pleased with the boots."
4.0,They suit the purpose.
4.0,Wish I could wear the dress on both shoulders and have it look as cute.  It’s very flattering and made of a nice weight fabric!
4.0,Be aware that this doesn’t come with an underskirt or the side material that gives the skirt that shape. It’s common for sellers to not include these but I thought I’d mention it just in case.<br /><br />The material looked cheap and not as pretty as in the picture. That’s my only complaint and why I removed one star. It’s ok for theater (or anyone not looking at it up-close) but not for film.
4.0,"Quality shirt, have owned others the same previously. Got a large this time as the size I had before was LT and was a tad big. The large seems bigger yet. I haven’t washed it yet so might shrink a bit"
4.0,"I am 5'3, 130lbs, 34D, 27 in waist and 38 in hips and ordered a Large, I typically wear a medium. Its soft and fits well. I'm including some photos to show the fit on my body style. I have a white tank on underneath so you can see where the holes are. The photo of my back, I rounded my back so you can see the holes a little better. You can also see how long it is and how it lays. I personally would have liked it to be a little longer. The holes are not distressed, they are clean cut. Overall, I am pleased with the shirt."
4.0,These are great for my daughter to wear during basketball games. It keeps her long hair (and sweat) out of her face & you get to control the tightness of the headband.
4.0,Worked great my daughter liked them.
4.0,I bought this for my boyo and aired on the side of caution and bought an XXL. He's 140 lbs and it fit him perfectly. I'm about 170 and it fits so so. A bit tight in the arms.<br />The colors are fantastic and it's held up so far through a few washes. I recommend
4.0,Very cute. Thinner material than I expected but still like the top
4.0,"It was a solid, good quality watch.  I had to return it because I didn't read the description close enough and didn't notice how big it is.  It's about the size of a silver dollar (or an oreo cookie :-)  I needed something smaller.  But, that was my mistake not theirs and if I needed a larger clip watch I would have kept it."
4.0,"I've worn this dress multiple times now. I've gotten a lot of compliments when I've worn it to work and from family and friends.<br />Positive:<br />It has not had any loose threads or color fading after multiple washings.<br />It's true to color.<br />Fits well and is very cute.<br />Stitching is solid.<br />The dress is extremely soft.<br /><br />Cons:<br />The dress wrinkles easily.<br />If you wear black underneath it, it is visible."
4.0,These shorts are a good deal for the money. I would have liked if the waist was a bit higher. I have to pull them up frequently.
4.0,"Comfy, well-made, sturdy"
4.0,Very light weight. Comfortable and loose
4.0,Great size and functionality however the material smells strongly of chemical smell. I have several fresheners in it now to remove the dye or chemical smell. I really like the space however and everything else about it.
4.0,"I was going to return them, but kept it...They look big and nice on me."
4.0,"very light in weight, but nice"
4.0,"Note for seller first option fits up to 38 to 40 size, anything above that opt for the 54 inch"
4.0,"Very roomy for the size, but it is very plastic looking"
4.0,"Better than I thought it would be! It works and the band is better quality than anticipated. The background is more just glitter than galaxy patterned, but still pretty."
4.0,It makes me look bigger
4.0,Fuzzy and cute but not as nice of fabric as I had hoped. Bought for family photo so not a huge deal. Dollar store carries some that are better quality cheaper
4.0,"Casual polyester dress. Fairly structured, warm fabric. It has a ruched/stretchy back panel, and I would recommend ordering your normal size or a size smaller for a better fit. Has pockets on the front."
4.0,Its great...  and stylish . Will buy again
4.0,"I am short (5'4&#34;) with thick calves. Since the shaft of the boot goes very high (good for deep snow), the top is pretty snug on my calves, but not too snug to wear. Someone with smaller calves or someone very short might find the boots to be too bulky. However, the boot has a cinchable gaiter and compression straps, which could mitigate that bulk. I don't personally need to adjust those in my everyday wear.<br /><br />I use these boots primarily when spending a lot of time standing outside at our outdoor hockey rink. My previous boots would leave my feet too cold. These boots definitely insulate me from the frozen ground when I'm standing around and not being very active.<br /><br />I haven't yet tried heavy activity (sledding or snow shoeing), but I would definitely wear these in those activities."
4.0,Comfortable and look good... well as good  as a damn mask anyway.
4.0,"I thought these were leggings, but they are more of a fleece-lined sweat pant. Still cute though."
4.0,"I have had this attached to  my cell phone since I received it, it looks so much like my black and tan chihuahua!  Its nicely made and has held together. Perhaps a little larger would show off better if the redo it."
4.0,Great Bag! It's all I thought it would be and more. It holds the extra sweater nicely as well. Hope to get another one soon!!!
4.0,"Overall really good, wish it was just a tiny bit larger inside to accommodate a 8.5x11 day timer comfortably.  It will fit but curls edges."
4.0,"I ordered this for my husband, yes I’m the wife who picks out clothing.🤭🙄<br /><br />Let me just say that this shirt gave me mixed emotions.<br />While I like the material and the way it looked on the model, it has some good and bad points.<br /><br />Good:<br />Material is nice and sturdy linen cotton blend.<br />Has a nice pattern that is subtle.<br />This type of shirt fits my husband body type,short and stocky.<br />The fit,  well…<br /><br />It isn’t bad just not sure about the intended body type.<br />While I like the fit, it is awkwardly tight in certain areas.<br /> The bicep area is a little restrictive, then it tapers by the waist giving a slimming effect. (We like)<br /><br />However, the bottom of the shirt is loose and I’m not too fond of the buttons and the pattern at the bottom.<br /><br />If you’re tall and lengthy this shirt will be short. My husband is 5ft7 so it fits him ok.<br /><br />May want to size up if taller and bigger biceps.<br /><br />Overall, it’s an ok shirt. 5the value kind of reflects the quality. That’s why the four stars."
4.0,"These Dansko Boots run a tiny bit shorter compared to the Dansko Cynthias I bought earlier this winter.<br />I so wanted to love these boots.  The quality is unbelievable. The leather is so soft.  The calf area fit with plenty of room to spare (unlike what other reviewers said).<br />But as another person reviewed, the ankle segment is not narrow enough, so these look more like rainboots than stylish ones."
4.0,"The overall fit was as expected. Material isn't flimsy, it's flattering and hugs/holds all my curves. I'm 5'4"" 142lbs for reference, curvy on the bottom. The only issue i had was the straps slide down and it would be nice if they were adjustable. Otherwise for the price you can't beat it."
4.0,Very cute style but didn't like the color.
4.0,Odd rope holding it all together that may be a hand hold or something that is not gonna look good with anything.
4.0,Softest I’ve ever had. I wear them on my head when working. Most comfortable ever!
4.0,There are many things that I see when I look at this purse. The outer shell feels like a nice leather (I couldn't find a material listing on the purse). The inside is lined with a satin feeling flowered design material that really doesn't go with the southwestern outer shell. The color that shows in the picture (which looks the same when I took a picture) is not true life the purse actually has a more greenish blue that is very pretty. The outer side pockets and top clasp are magnetic closures. The back zipper closure does hold a 9mm Ruger with no problems. The inside has a center zippered pouch and side zippered pouch with good amount of room on each side of the center pouch. The top zipper closure for the purse was a negative for me because it leaves either end open (I will provide a picture). The purse itself feels heavier than what I'm use to but really isn't an issue as I wanted the purse because of the back zippered pocket.<br />Disclosure: I received this product at a discount for my honest review. I am not affiliated with the seller or the company that made this product.
4.0,"Cute dress for a good price. Got a lot of compliments on it (wore to a wedding).  Was a bit loose around the shoulders/arms, but it fit well enough to not need a tailor."
4.0,Perfect for my son glad I went up a size!
4.0,I really like the shirt....quality garment and delivery was speedy!
4.0,They feel great. Just right for my 8M feet. Only I wish the&#34;SB SOX&#34; logo was not so visible when I wear my flats.
4.0,"They was a bit small, very pretty though"
4.0,I bit too long
4.0,"I got tired of my four y/o taking his swim suit off in the pool so I got this one because it zips in the back. He is big for a 4 year old so I chose the 5/6, boy am I glad I did.  It's barely long enough for him.  It works good for me."
4.0,I wish if turtle neck was little more close to my neck
4.0,Arrived promptly. Nice quality shirt. Nicely done embroidery! I’m impressed! My son is going to love it!
4.0,Has a soft and a quality look to it.  Works as advertised.  Will buy again for my other guitar
4.0,Super cute but fits too wide for my little one. Even if I wrap it tight it is still too loose.
4.0,Nice fits as expected<br />Not very high quality<br /><br />Good enough for a party use
4.0,"When the reviews suggested ordering a size down I took that advice; however, I should’ve ordered two sizes down."
4.0,Looks nice but the elastic slips off easily.
4.0,"A very comfortable fit, decent quality, definitely photochromatic."
4.0,"I love the material, coral color is not see through at all. Very bright and beautiful. The problem is this item fits way too small!!  Length was great too but again waist & butt area are way too small. The legs were super tight too. Sadly will have to return since there is not a bigger size. Shame!"
4.0,"I got these for a granddaughter's 7th birthday, and she loves them. They are so pretty! However, she has asked me (twice) to write to the people and let them know that the flexible rubber back of the earring, got stuck in the back of her ear. It must have been a bit stressful because 3-1/2 months later, she is still talking about it. Her mom had to replace the earring backs with another pair of metal backs. She says the rubber caused the back to get stuck and they had to work at it to get it out. Her jaw dropped when I said I gave them 5 stars anyway. She asked me to take off a star for the backs."
4.0,They're a little bit looser than I thought and the waist is too large but I really like them and they are a good length and good quality material very thin and crispy though.<br />The waist is kinda loose for the weight the pants have to keep up. Aka they kept sliding off me!
4.0,it is a really nice shirt but for me it did not work as well because I have a large stomach when worn long it really shows it off.
4.0,"Bought these for 2 granddaughters, 12 and 8, 8 yr. Loves it, 12 yr old? Older sister teased her, so? They are very lightweight, little hard to push up and take down, they work tho. I needed them for them to use from school to car, and to fit on backpacks, do exactly what we needed for now."
4.0,Great quality. Just took a really long time to get to me. Longer than it said it would.
4.0,I would have kept this cute tee if it had been a bit wider.
4.0,"I ordered this item in Navy 3X and Black 4X. My issue was the 3X pant was great as I normally wear a 3X, however, the top was a bit snug. With the 4X top was good and the pants were a bit too big. I am barrel-shaped.  The material was good nice and light, which makes for a good summer pj."
4.0,The leggings arrived as pictured. The material is a little too thin than I expected but not transparent. Has a good stretch to it and comfortable.
4.0,Pants just do mot fit my body type but I like them and can wear them.
4.0,"The neckline looks out of place and I didn't notice the slits on the shoulders when I looked at the original pictures, but I like the shirt regardless.  Very excited to wear this."
4.0,The material & quality were very good but I'm 5'6 & have hips/butt at 160 lbs it was too short showed the bottom of my butt cheeks & gave me the ever dreaded camel toe. LOL just not for a taller girl I guess unless you're more slender.
4.0,"Good quality leather, liked it."
4.0,"We ordered this for a teenager who loves Prince, since the symbol is very similar. It arrived promptly and looks amazing. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because the pendant made out of soapstone and cut thinly which makes it’s more fragile than I realized it would be. Luckily, this was for an older teen, but a younger child might accidentally break it. If it’s worn and treated as a piece of jewelry, it should hold up just fine. I liked how quickly it arrived and the reasonable price! Thank you!"
4.0,These were comfortable to wear however they were very long for me as well as I am 5ft 2 And had to cut them at least 4 inches or more and so them. I am short wasted so my legs are the longest part of my body just in case for the other women that are petite. But they were perfect with my mad hatter costume.
4.0,"So I got this beanie thinking it would be for my husband...but I'm pretty sure I'm keeping it for myself! It is very thick, good quality and looks really cute on! I can't speak on how it will hold up to washing but based on how nice it is, I think it will last me a long time. I ordered this in black, and wish I had gotten a couple of other colors! I did get this beanie at a discounted price in exchange for my review-my opinion of the beanie is honest and unbiased however and I would for sure recommend it as the ones in the stores here are much thinner and more expensive!"
4.0,Love the design but hard to get to start working. Once it started though it was great! Nice slim design! Recommended.
4.0,"I love the necklace, very nice for the price, u can't. Beat the price less then five bucks, Hot pink in color,,"
4.0,Super cute pair of suspenders for my teenage son to wear to his homecoming dance!
4.0,"Nice fabric, washes well, but needs air dried.  Received lots of compliments"
4.0,Have had this strap for 3wks now on my gear fit2 pro. Black colour looks great and blends well with the watch. Came with an easy to use link removal tool. Didnt need a manual to use it! Now have had several workouts with no issues. Will wait to see how the colour and joints fair with the sweat of marathons! Watch the charging as the strap tends to get in the way with the magnet on the charger
4.0,"I loved the look of this purse and it’s size…. But the leather side strap that holds the guitar strap broke. I thought it was just a fluke so I purchased another. Nope, second purse broke in the same place as the first.<br />Follow up- they sent me a third purse and it hasn’t had a single issue. I have used it daily for almost a month now."
4.0,"I had been warned the sizing was off a bit from a friend who was wearing these pants.  I am small in USA sizes.  Here I bought a large.  The waist is big, but it’s stretchy, a belt will do.  The leg length and width are good."
4.0,"Great watch, tough as nails. The white seems to show wear a little more perhaps than another color, the only thing keeping me from giving it a 5."
4.0,Very cute and she loved it.  Just fits weird in the butt.  (Maybe she just don’t have one lol) it is  cute though
4.0,I'M A LADY. IT IS SOME WHAT LARGE.
4.0,Almost too small. I can wear it but it’s skin tight.  Good thing it’s under a blouse or it wouldn’t work for me.
4.0,This swimsuit it's perfect the material does not feels cheap it's great quality and nice looking. I ordered a xl because according to the size tab because of my weight and height that one will fitted better but a L would have been better actually.
4.0,"It's a cute dress, more on the thinner type of material. I  have a big butt and thick legs so it tends to rise up when I would walk. For the price it was an okay purchase."
4.0,The bracelet is long enough to use for several different sized wrist. The tag is neat for the price. It is nice to hang off a jewelry box or dresser but I wouldn't recommend it for a necklace. I would suggest this product to others.
4.0,Its weird that most of these products are smaller than expected but mine was actually longer than expected.
4.0,Not bad. I’ve attached photos here of it tucked in and not tucked in and with sleeves scrunched up and rolled up. A little bit itchy. Not see through. Found a couple of random colored threads woven in. I may just try to cut out. There is no indicator of front or back. It’s very baggy. I wish they sold in xsmall. I am 5’5 130lb and bought the small
4.0,GREAT SHIRT but runs small. Defiantly order a size up. Really love the shirt! Thank you Amazon!
4.0,"Beautiful, size and design is as shown, but shows a lot of cleavage."
4.0,"Nice dress, but runs very small"
4.0,May want to order one size down
4.0,"Can't give these a full five star because I just got them in the mail but wanted to try the fit. I love these because I'm in construction and it's difficult to feel sexy when I'm in jeans and a tee-shirt all the time, but with the little bit of lace and bling I feel sexier. Also, because I'm in construction, I needed something comfortable and the cotton with the full back does just the trick. I'm very happy with my purchase, well worth the money."
4.0,Great stocking stuffers! Very bright and pretty colors. Only holds a regular size chapstick. Doesnt really hold a tube of carmex type. But they still work great.
4.0,Shorter than I thought but cute.
4.0,this watch winder is very nice looking and displays watches beautifully.  wish it were a little easier to get in but since this is my first one maybe it's the way they all are.
4.0,Great value for a good product
4.0,Comfortable shoe but seems to run half a size too small.
4.0,This oversized sweatshirt is huge and very comfortable. It’s nice for snuggling up with and relaxing. It even has a phone pocket and a sweatshirt pocket for bigger items. It’s very soft and it definitely will you warm.
4.0,"This is very thick and comfortable.  I really like the weight of the fabric, and it is cozy.  The only negative thing I have found in the garment is that the facing on both sides of the zipper is not secured to the front, so it flaps open when the coat is not zipped."
4.0,"The bras are very nice, but I couldnt fit them. So, I give them away to save the hassle of paying to return them."
4.0,I have smallish fingers so it’s too big for me I rapped a string around it a few times and now it fits but other than that it’s good quality.
4.0,awesome lenses! the fit is really snug on your face
4.0,"The glasses were nicer than expected.  They have spring action arms and actually have polarized lenses.  They are no Costa but they are great for the money. I was on vacation and needed a pair I wasnt going to be mad if I broke, they fit they fit the bill!  They took a beating and I still have them.  Cannot beat for $7 and I would buy them again."
4.0,"A little small, but good overall.  Love the soft material and the length is good."
4.0,Very cute hat and soft which I liked for my 6 month old but it is too big for him which is fine bc he will grow into it
4.0,Very light flexible and comfortable.  Everything I expected. Good footwear for tactile sensation and in and out of water and for shorter walks.
4.0,"It is a shame, isn't it, that a US company cannot make shirts like these instead of having to import them? The ""40 Grit"" by Duluth Trading Co, is a nice fitting short sleeved T-shirt that is a bit thicker than some cotton shirts. The flame red color should not be confused to have any significance other than its being a bright, stand-out-in-the-crowd hue. Design and dyeing seem like they are well done, and the shirt holds its shape and size if laundered per instructions. I would not suggest using hot water to wash it or high heat to dry it.<br /><br />The lenght and overall sizing are pretty much spoty on for a large shirt. I'll keep a star back simply because the price is higher than it needs to be but everyone has his/her price point. This one about $5 higher than it merits in my view."
4.0,would have liked it to be a little thicker. all in all. it is fine
4.0,Love this dress. Get compliments all the time
4.0,"One of the pearls had broke off the necklace when I received it in the mail, so I'll have to try and put it back on, but otherwise very pretty and love my purchase!"
4.0,Love the idea and quality of this sock but you need to order down a size and if any amount of bunching bothers you then forget it.
4.0,Love the darkness level and glare reduction they offer.  Have noticed a significant decrease in headaches when driving home.  One minor thing; I wish they wrapped around the corners of my eyes to block the light there too.
4.0,Great and feel great. They ware quickly but are still good
4.0,Beautiful dress and very well made. I got this for my daughter for homecoming and ordered a small because she is very petite. It fits very well every were but the bust. She is an A cup and it does not quite fit right in that area not even with a push up bra.
4.0,"Back strap is thin, but generally happy."
4.0,so soft and feels good but it takes so long for delivery schedule.
4.0,So far it's been good for the summer.  I can't wear bra straps when I'm sweating!
4.0,"i love this shirt.  It is so trendy and the size was just right.

4.0,It's pretty awesome for the price. It's slim and it works.
4.0,I ABSOLUTELY LOVE this bag. It was everything that I wanted. Perfect! So much room! 5/5!!! But...the stitching started falling apart within a couple months. 4/5... I plan on buying another and reenforcing it in the weak points.
4.0,I love the ethnic look of these earrings but I wish I could shrink them down a bit and lightened them up a bit.
4.0,"runs big, love the pockets...."
4.0,"I got this sweatshirt in army green and it is exactly as pictured. It’s completely adorable! However, using the size chart provided I chose XL because it said the bust was 50” and mine is 48”. But, it was *very* tight and I was completely unable to wear it. Maybe I got one made incorrectly, but I suggest sizing up because it appears their size chart could be incorrect. For reference, I am 5‘6“ tall, 205 pounds, and typically wear a size 1X/2X or 14W/16W size tops."
4.0,"These socks were just what I was looking for as far as a breathable merino dress sock is concerned.  The only reason I did not rate them a 5 is that they are not machine dryable.  Since I couldn’t find any that were, I am still happy with them and take care to keep them out of the regular laundry.  I love everything else about them."
4.0,The pink color is a bit lighter than the photo. The faux leather looks real and could pass for a high end bag. The only downside is the corners seem to show a little bit of a collapse.
4.0,"I bought these for my almost 6 month old because he has a rather large head, and I live in a small town, we have gotten quite a bit of anow this year, and its been quite cold. and I couldn't find any beanies for him besides the same ones I already have that don't really fit him well. They are too big, but at least I will have them for next year. They are soft, and from feeling them I don't think they will be itchy. Seem to be good quality. Made well. And they are super cute"
4.0,"The insole quality is excellent and for the money an exceptional value. But the reason for not giving five stars is the size 12-13 run small. The only reason I will not return them is the sole just fit my size 12 shoes. After getting out my scissors expecting to do a little trimming I was surprised when the soles required no trimming. If you are a size 13, I would not recommend buying these insoles. Again I want reiterate the quality and price are an exceptional value!"
4.0,"I usually wear A 16/xlg. This Lg/xlg fits ok but I wish it was bigger and more flowy. I’m 5’8” and it doesn’t quite hit my ankles. About 1 1/2” too short for the way I’d prefer...I like the fabric, the crochet and the colors are beautiful. Pockets would have been a great addition. I bought this for a dress but think I’ll use it as a nightgown or loungewear instead"
4.0,"Fits well, very comfortable and despite how easily it wrinkles happy with my overall appearance. Wears well as daily wear or for date night"
4.0,Fit well<br />Decent material<br />Good for the price
4.0,To be used  outdoors in the extreme cold temps
4.0,"If you want cheap Mickey ears, look no further but...just know that the ears are much closer together than the real thing. Either way, had fun at Disney with them."
4.0,where them alot
4.0,My husband received free nascar tickets through work and our 5-year-old really wanted to go and see &#34;Lightning McQueen&#34;.  So they went.  The head phones did a great job dampening the noise but we were still concerned about the volume so he wore ear plugs also. That's the reason why I gave them 4 stars.  They didn't quiet the noise as much as I would have liked but they probably would have been perfect for a concert or something not as loud. They also did fit him very well which was also important.  He had a great time watching the cars.
4.0,a little bit big for the medium wrist
4.0,"It is quite lovely once I figured out how to put it on. The chain between the ring and bracelet is almost too short, so it was a little tricky trying to make it work. I do have “piano hands” that are very long and slender so I can only fit it on my pinky comfortably. By stretching the spiral in the ring, I can fit it onto my ring finger. I bought the butterfly design. I like it a lot, but I do wish it had more wiggle room."
4.0,I love the comfort level and roomy feel to these. They allow airflow and stretch for movement. The only thing that would make these better is if they were more moisture wicking. I get these are mens underwear but I bought them because they were a great price and came in my size. Surprisingly they are cute and more unisex then I expected. It would be amazing if this company had womens underwear I would buy them. Especially if they were moisture wicking and had a way to secure femine products to them. Just giving some feedback these are great underwear and sadly sometimes we break the norm and but something on sale because other options are just to much.
4.0,worth the money. be careful with it don't drop!
4.0,Good quality for the low price you are paying. I bought this for my dad because he loves barbecuing food and is a huge fan of star wars.
4.0,"Beautiful, but I ordered the wrong size.  I was going by US sizing and this product is sized completely different.  An XL is like a size 10 US so be careful and make sure you are ordering what you need."
4.0,Great light weight hoodie. Fits as expected
4.0,Missing a strap. Please send a strap to complete the outfit.
4.0,Perfect small crossbody purse for vacation. I like the different compartments. Passports fit in perfect to keep them on hand.
4.0,"This dress was way to long on me even with 4 inch heel it drags, it looks nice on, if I am standing on something"
4.0,"I got this shirt because I loved the design and the bright colors for my Hogwarts house. The shipping time was great. I received it very promptly after ordering it and it was in wonderful condition. The only downside, is that I wear a 2X to a size 3X. I ordered a 2X thinking I should be fine, but it fits like a large or an extra large. Very disappointed with the size, I'll have to cut it up and sew in some side panels for it to be able to work. Hopefully I'll be able to use it in the future somehow."
4.0,I liked everything about this dress . Look forward to wearing this summer . I have in mind of getting a slip dress to wear under neath . The dress is very sheer . Love the length . Even though I’m petite looks great on  with flat sandals . C
4.0,"If these were for adults, I'd give them 1 star. They're super cheap and were a little crooked, but they're perfect for the price for small kids. Doesn't matter if they get lost or broken since they're so cheap."
4.0,"Overall very happy with this purchase. I'm 5'6"" & the medium is just above floor length but perfect for flats or sandals. The chest area is a little see through if you're big busted so I'd suggest a tank underneath. Love the pockets feature , though 1 of mine came with a large hole that I have to sew up. You can do a lot with this dress and I jazz mine up with a wide fitted belt. Very comfortable dress"
4.0,I love this T-shirt! The fabric is great and it’s very comfortable. It was little bigger fit than expected but I’m glad it was.
4.0,"Ok honest review it’s a cute store run fit or AirPort run. I am thicker at the bottom , 34D -31-47 hips. They make my underwear show as you can see so i would have to go pantie less orrr A cute thong because when i sit down people willl see it!<br />Now I ordered a XL , I have never been a XXL but if you have hips and booty definitely get it because it gets tight around the thigh area ( I hate that😩)  Either way it’s cute , I don’t think it’s worth $30 plus but it’s ok."
4.0,"My aunt ordered a small and it didn't fit her, she forgot to return it so she gave it to me. The bottoms fit perfectly and the swimsuit is cute and true to the color pictured (I have the pink one). The only issue I have is with the top. I'm a 34B so I probably could have done an XS, but I noticed they didn't offer that. The pads will sometimes rise up too far where it offers less support and I'm guessing it's because I'm small-breasted so it's slightly more loose. Overall it's a good swimsuit."
4.0,My daughter won't take it off even to wash it before she goes trick or treating. You
4.0,"These underwear run really large. I bought them for my 2.5 year old and they would fit my 5 year old. They are also definitely a boy short cut not a boxer brief. They are well made with nice thick cotton and a cute print, just order a couple sizes down if you want them to fit. At least they are too big rather than too small so my son can grow into them eventually."
4.0,"We had a Cobra Kai party so these were a great addition to our gift goodie bags. I gave them only 4 stars because they are way over priced. You can get other bracelets in larger quantities for much, much less. It's just popular now, so your really just paying for the newness of it. But otherwise they are great."
4.0,"The good:  The feathers are just like pictured.<br />The bad:  The clip is not great.  Does not hold well and I need extra hair pins to hold it in place. (The reason for 4-stars)<br />The even better:  For you DIYers, it's easy to modify/customize to match your costume if you don't like the round center piece.  The center piece pulled off with little force (don't think it would come off on its own, btw) and the feathers did not fall apart.  What was left was a surface that I could glue a different hair clip top to.  Perfect!  The pictures I shared shows the surface you can glue to and my finished product (more Art Deco and matches my 1920s Gatsby outfit better than the original)."
4.0,Feet and legs felt very well wearing them. I bit hard to get on because of arthritis in hip but managed it. I did get the argyle and had the pattern on my legs for a bit after taking off so next pair will be plain!
4.0,"Comfy, cozy and flattering"
4.0,I keep these in my vehicle and use some times not a big fan of sun glasses but when you need them so the price was right
4.0,I got it for my daughter (12) and I ended giving it to my son (9) because it was too small..  Very warm (which I appreciate for the low temperatures) and nice design.
4.0,I like this jacket. Only the lining is smaller than the outside jacket. Its not awful. I just ware a short sleeve shirt under it and its fine. My mom sews and she is going to fix it for me. I dont think getting a bigger size would help much.
4.0,"Finally a great pair of glasses that I look good in.They are a bit dark when wearing them, but thats ok with me. Great product, great price. Would recommend to anyone."
4.0,Very nice dress same to the picture
4.0,"I love how these look but be careful, your eyes are visible through these so people try to make eye contact. My only complaint is that on longer drives the nosepads can leave marks if you leave the glasses in one spot."
4.0,"True to size, maybe slightly smaller. Light weight with decent stitching. Overall worth the money"
4.0,Good quality and the picture on the masks were not blurry. It was not to have the adjustable ear piece. Brought these as Christmas gift.
4.0,"This dress is very pretty, flattering,  and is a good value for the price. It looks like it would cost a lot more! I got the navy color to wear to a baby shower for my friend. The rayon fabric is soft and comfortable (no stretch). I love the belt and ruffled detail on the skirt. As with many international brands, the sizing seems different than US sizing. I currently wear a Small or Medium in dresses at US stores, so I ordered a Medium, Large, and XL to cover my bases. The large fit well while the XL was very big on me. The difference in fit between the two sizes was more than I would expect, so perhaps the sizing is not consistent. Because the Large fit nicely, I did not try on the Medium, but it would likely have been a bit small. I’m 5 ft 8, and it just covered my kneecaps. However, the sleeves were a little bit short, fitting more like 3/4 than full length. The quality of the dress seems good overall. The fabric is thin and a little sheer, so I wore a slip which I was glad to have on when a gale of wind blew up my skirt! The neckline is also very revealing, so I sewed it up a little bit to get more coverage. The only other issue was that the one of the loops that holds the belt in place started coming off before I even wore the dress, but that is a pretty easy fix. I really like this dress despite some minor drawbacks, and would recommend it if you are willing to work with it for what it is."
4.0,"They're pretty cute, but I'd size up.. I'm 5""3 and 113 and I got the smalls. They fit, but they're kinda smaller than I'd like so the butt pattern is a bit low and almost makes my butt look smaller. Otherwise they're good leggings and comfortable. I like the pink color a lot."
4.0,"Worked great for breastfeeding just what I was looking for, but order a size bigger if you don't want it skin tight!"
4.0,Only worn it once but loved it. Didn't shrink when washed so I am<br />very satisfied with this purchase!
4.0,Very nice material. Well made. Gorgeous color. Sizing is very off though. It fits as a junior’s tunic. No where near a women’s dress. I’m just glad i read the reviews! I’m 5’6” 150-160 the XL it fit quite well.
4.0,"This is a truly unique stretching set . What makes it so different is that it comes with the usual sizes plus 7 gauge (3.5mm) and 5 gauge (4.5mm) and (9mm) . My ears don't stretch well so I was having trouble going from 8 to 6 gauge . This set allowed me to split the difference and easily go to 7 gauge first .<br />  There's a couple of bad things about this set too . The 6mm and the 3mm tapers are polished finish on both sides while the rest are glittery finish on one side and polished on the other . The set also comes with 2x 14 gauge tapers but no 14 gauge tunnels so it's essentially a 12ga - 00ga set . You will have to supply your own 14ga tunnels to make the set complete .<br />  The tunnels and tapers screw together for a relatively smooth insertion . I've had no nickel reaction whatsoever after a week . I'm not to fond of the glittery finish , but if you hate it , the back side is actually polished natural stainless , you can flip it around . These seem to be wider and heavier than my other set so they'd be good if you find other sets too thin .<br />  All in all , a very useful set even if you buy it just for the 7 & 5 gauges like me . Don't think I'll go as big as 9mm but it's certainly a bonus too . Even though I have another set that I normally use that's less gaudy , I may actually end up using this set instead simply because I like the screw on tapers much better than the non-threaded style . Recommended .<br />**Edit** found that the 2ga tapers have a different thread than the 2ga tunnels and totally do not work together . I will drill out the threads on the 2ga tapers so they will at least fit over the tunnel threads . Very much a hodgepodge set of pieces put together as a set . Most work fine ."
4.0,Dress looks exactly like the picture and fits as expected!!
4.0,"I love the pocketbook, Only thing is the purse is so stiff."
4.0,"Beautiful! Nicely made, feels sturdy. I am definitely buying more from this seller. The prices are fabulous and item is of good quality."
4.0,"I would have given this 5 stars, but it was kind of expensive for one septum ring. Also, the rubber pieces come off easily and the pincher fell out of my septum and disappeared after only a couple days of wearing it."
4.0,The zipper as mentioned in the other reviews is something of a problem. It fits small in the knees on legs so I would probably size up. Otherwise great quality. Better than expected.
4.0,face protection from covid-19 that is lightweight.  This is cooler than others I have and its getting real hot in Texas.<br />It's easy to slip over your ears and still protect myself.
4.0,"The gown is well made but does not seem to be sized right. The length of arms and ankle appear to be for a petite person. Otherwise the large size is fine for the body. The design, color and lace trim is beautiful."
4.0,The top is very flexible and expandable and also thee color is awesome.
4.0,Kind of big which makes them a bit awkward. Cute and sparkly though. I like them
4.0,"Item came on time, nice pair of glasses. I actually ordered another pair after this one for my husband."
4.0,"Bought these for my daughter, larger than I expected but very pretty"
4.0,"I like them, but did not realize the bi-focal part is very low in the lens.  So to see my car's instrument cluster, I need to TILT MY HEAD BACK. For reading they are probably fine. If you want them for driving to see your instruments, I suggest you opt for a more traditional style which does not require a head tilt. That being said, they are pretty decent if you use them for their intended purpose."
4.0,works okay
4.0,"Served the purpose, contained all relevant docs in a handy place."
4.0,Everything fits well
4.0,Pretty design - polyester and potentially will cause perspiration. B
4.0,"Hasn't slowed down yet, even after some rough outdoor activities. Though is a slight annoyance to keep the watch strap down."
4.0,I misread the price when ordering. Don’t usually pay that much for a top
4.0,breezy and comfy.
4.0,Love that they  are polarized and that the hinges over extend to take on and off super easy. Or to go over a hat or hair.
4.0,"COAT IS COMFORTABLE, STYLISH, FITS WELL. THE SLEEVES ARE A BIT LONG, FOR ME, BUT I HAVE THE SAME PROBLEM<br />WITH MOST COATS.  VERY PLEASED WITH THE STYLE AND COMFORT.  LOVE THE COLOR."
4.0,"The quality of shirt is just ok, for is good, a little loose but what I expected from the pic."
4.0,Nice material and fits well.  Only giving 4 bc its way too long
4.0,"I bought 4 leos from Amazon for my daughter at the same time, and this one was my favorite.  It is very elegant, and an adult medium was a perfect fit for my teenage daughter (5 ft 3.5 in; 118 pounds of solid muscle; 34B). The shelf bra provides sufficient support for her to wear as is."
4.0,Not a bad product.  Relatively heavy but not unbearable.  Fun colors match all my styles.
4.0,They fit great on most adults.  I’m small and they are too big for me but fit my husband perfectly.
4.0,I loved the style of the sweater & the color but it was way too large & felt like it would stretch more.
4.0,some of the blue trim wore away after first use. more padding near scrotum area would be helpful.
4.0,the color is a little off otherwise it's a great pair of zipper pants
4.0,"This is a very cheap suit. For the price, it's nice. Don't expect anything fancy. This suit is not made for an XL or TALL individual."
4.0,"I love these leggings! The color with the silver confetti design is adorable and trendy. I love the look of these leggings, they are definitely high-waisted, stretchy to fit my legs, and very silky/buttery soft. I wore these around the house for a bit but have yet to wash/dry them. I've never seen these at the gym before, so I know the design is newer and neat looking.<br /><br />The reason I debated 4 stars over 5 is because I would not rate this as ""quality material."" All of my other workout leggings are a little thicker material and these are a bit on the thin side.  They remind me of a similar material to my Lularoe leggings super soft but a little thin. I do plan on wearing them to workout or around the house and they're so cute maybe even to run some errands but I would still not classify this as ""quality material."" In addition, I was hoping being that they're high waisted they'd be control-top or compression-top to help hide my muffin top, but they are not.  They just go up high. Also, they tend to scrunch a little at the bottom by the ankles which results me in pulling them up a little higher. I'm 5'8 and got a large.<br /><br />Overall though, I'd definitely buy these or gift them.  Recommended because of cuteness. If you want to stand out at the gym, your workout class, or have your husband compliment you, pick these! Guaranteed to make heads turn. The silver on the black really pops. Very cute."
4.0,Gave this to granddaughter as a gift.  She did not seem excited about the necklace and we don to know why.  We have not seen her wearing it.
4.0,I really like this product. It's shiny and not easy to break. It's long enough. Worth the money. I rate them 4 because I think they should have a spare part and glue included.
4.0,"Ok, so I did like them, but it’s true what another review said, the just so wrong on the size, I’m glad I listen to the other review and orde a bigger size from the begging. So I bought my 8 yo the size 10 and my 9 yo the 12-14. And they fit just about right. I’m sure they won’t be able to use them next year."
4.0,A very artistic cover for a young person!!!<br />It is a very cute cover I give it to my daughter for Christmas and she love it! Other  friends ask me where I got it from.i give this product a 4 star.
4.0,"Very shiny patent leather imitation, buckle is shiny but is a stamped shape rather than a solid rounded piece.  But it looks good and the price was great."
4.0,"Typically I wear size small but mediums fit me as well, I’m a ‘Smedium’. I ordered a medium in hopes that this would be slightly bigger. I just received it and it looked super small. I put it on and it fit like a small and the neck is super tight so it will definitely mess up your hair if you take it on/off but on the plus side if you wear a tshirt under it you shouldn’t be able to see the neck of it.<br />Wish I would have gotten a large now..But it is super cute!"
4.0,Very good design if the quality can be enhanced that would be wonderful.
4.0,"Gorgeous looking bathing suit and it fits well. The only downfall is the awkward back piece, no matter what I did it didn't look right."
4.0,"The only bad sides to this are that it runs larger than normal, the XL was a size 20-22 rather than a size 16-18 like most are.  It also is a bit heavier fabric than I usually wear in summer, but is so loose and flowy that is not much of a problem except on very humid days."
4.0,present for my(new -mom) daughter
4.0,"I don't wear skirts, nothing against them, I just prefer basketball shorts or khakis. That being said my wife loves this skirt and I think she looks good in it, and she is very hard to please....serious"
4.0,I thought they would be heavier but very nice
4.0,They look exactly like the pictures. They are very noticeable when I wear them.
4.0,very nice material can't wait to use it this winter to the Caribbean islands
4.0,"4 stars OnLy because they dont make another larger size for ReaL MeN. I wear a size 15 shoe. I dont wear wide shoes.<br />I am with a bit of force and anger able to get these on LoL. After i do get them on they give my feet all day support up to about 8-9 hours and then i start to feel some discomfort but again some or all of this is due to the fact i have sasquatch size feet. And they still come all the way up to my knee caps. Overall i really like em though. They give awesome arch support and compression is not overly strangling, until that 8-9 hour period for me.<br />I did like em enuff to order the wife a pair though"
4.0,"I ordered this for my upcoming beach trip. For the price this is a nice swimsuit. It's well-made and looks like it will last. I wear a size 6-7 and ordered the Large and it fits okay. It's a little tight in the bottom. I thought the bottom would be more like shorts but it's not, so I will probably wear some over it. The top fits okay, I'm a 36C and it covers everything, however I was expecting there to be underwire - there isn't. It's nicely padded. It is flattering as well. Overall a good buy."
4.0,The V-neck was too deep for my pear shaped figure
4.0,Fabric was not nearly as opaque as the picture makes it seem.
4.0,Cute shirt. Cheaply made.
4.0,Love the color but the fabric was cheaper then I thought. The fabric was a cheap light weight fleece that shrunk after first wash. Please air dry and not machine dry. Wish I could've bought 2 sizes bigger.
4.0,The dress was beautiful. Very good & heavy quality. Listen to the size chart provided! I normally wear a small (which I bought). It did fit but was a little tight at the top... would've been the perfect fit if I had got a medium. Arrived on time!
4.0,Nice looking watch.  Don't know how it will stand up but will give it a try.
4.0,These are comfortable and helpful but the quality is not very good.  I had to send back the first package they sent me bc 2 of the socks were damaged.  They did make it right and sent replacements but through normal use a couple of the replacements have started to tear and come apart.
4.0,"I like it, but only one (1) earring came with it."
4.0,"Cute earrings, great value. Most stores are offering 2 to 3 pair per card for $10. 9 pair for $5 is a steal!"
4.0,"I like the sweater very much, but beware, I am usually S/M, I bought this in L and I could have gone for an XL too. The fabric is very soft, but not really breathable."
4.0,"Work as it advertised, it able to grip onto thing that you place on it due to the rubber material."
4.0,The quality of the material is perfect but it does run small. I'm usually a x-large order xx-large and it fit just a little snug but otherwise it's perfect. I love all the colors order two for this crazy weather in California.
4.0,"I like it a lot. The post is a little short for me (even the longest one), which is why only 4 stars"
4.0,These arent for really wearing around town. Theyre more for the beach or the shower or pool.
4.0,These are so cute and super comfy. I do recommend to buy as a gift or for yourself!!!!
4.0,"I Love all the choices because the balls always fall off so I need a to have a replacement ready . I wish there was at least one more black one because,  I already had that happen to it . I am giving this 4 stars because of the ball falling off already, but they all do that to me no matter what brand I get ..... at least I have 11 more to go, so this will last a while  :).... nice packaging and the rings stay securely on the card for saving and picking out your next choice ...."
4.0,"Hi I got pretty fat over this never ending first wave of *gestures vaguely* so I decided to wear dresses more as they are easier on the waist for more casual ones.<br /><br />However, I too would like to wear lace dresses but was disappointed that I couldn't stand how they pinched around the arms :( Dresses are always difficult to shop for online, even when you already measured most of your body for clothes shopping.<br /><br />However, fit my 170~ lb 5'7"" companion just fine, to give you an idea!<br /><br />Taking off a star for an annoying zipper."
4.0,Haven’t try it on yet
4.0,"cute, cheap, affordable. only have worn once so far"
4.0,These are nice earrings for the price. Beware though that the backings are very tiny. Not a huge problem for me but may be for others.
4.0,My 9-year-old really likes this set...especially the tail.  The mask is flexible enough to fit her fsce and mine.
4.0,"I ordered by what the size chart said to order and it is toooooo big.  Can't figure out how to contact someone to exchange it.  Every time I pick return/exchange, it won't let me exchange, wants me to return it.  I'm so confused."
4.0,What I liked. Nice thicker material. They breath well. The waist band is nice and wide but comfortable. The size was good. These shorts aren't rediculously long like other brands. So far these wash well.<br />What I don't like. The drawstring on both pairs I bought are pretty short. It is difficult to tie them off in a bow and you'd better make sure they are tied before washing or you'll be fishing them out of the loops. The inseam is not very roomy. They don't pinch or anything like that. They're just a bit too snug there.
4.0,I just received the package today! I love these products and have bought a few. This item came defective with corners seams unraveled and opened corners.
4.0,"I like the quality of these joggers. I can’t compare to any high end brands, but they feel nice and the waistband is sturdy. I am 5’3 and 125 lbs and I got size Medium. They fit perfectly.<br /><br />The only cons with these joggers are the length. I am 5’3 and they come just above my ankle. I wish they were longer. I’m short, so this won’t work well for anyone taller than me."
4.0,"They are not scrunch or butt lifting like the title of the product says.<br />They are super cute and super comfy though.<br />Iffy about the quality of them over time as I wear them to the gym, I guess we will see."
4.0,"I had a Tungsten Carbide ring that was heavy and I had bought it to prevent scratches while lifting weights.  I dont lift anymore but swim so I needed a lighter ring that didnt slip off in the pool.<br /><br />I dont like the contemporary wedding ring look and wanted a simple wedding band.  There was only one review at the time I bought this ring and it was positive.  I'm glad I bought it, it is much lighter than Tungsten (obviously)and I love the fact that I dont even feel its there.  Unlike my watch, I dont remove my wedding ring at night, so once its on it never comes off. Its not a Platinum ring but good enough for any occasion."
4.0,"Nicely put together, like the short handle and the long strap. It could be a little bit bigger overall, but it holds my tablet, 4 by 6 inch envelopes for sorting, a bound journal notebook and office supplies."
4.0,"Received this bag 5/10/2018.  The color, size and leather material was very good. However, as much as I wanted to Love this bag... Color is good looks like a light lavender... The shoulder strap was too short and created a large pucker in the center top portion when zipped. Ordered another style same color... Just couldn't totally commit to this one."
4.0,bought these for my 7yr old son and he loves them for in the water.
4.0,I love the glasses style but the first couple of times I used they the lens seemed just a little distorted.  But now I love them.
4.0,they feel great and fit well
4.0,"This watch is handsome and works well, keeping accurate time.  My one complaint about it is that the hands are VERY difficult to see, forcing me to put on my reading glasses to read the time.  And that is in broad daylight.  At night the luminous dial makes no sense because you cannot see the hands in low light even with glasses.  The design is excellent except for the irrational choice of putting invisible hands on it."
4.0,Like this top However it fit a little loose. The embroidery adds great interest. It can be dressed up and down. If I tuck it in and wear it with a skirt it could be it’s a good workout outfit but I usually wear with jeans.
4.0,"Super cute versatile dress, but not for anyone over a C cup, maybe even B."
4.0,"The fabric on this shirt is medium quality, not super thin but not weighty, either. Overall the shirt looks very good, but I'd say the general quality is no better than medium. The print and color on the fabric is really nice. Overall happy with the purchase."
4.0,Ran a little small but love it
4.0,Gave these as a gift to a friend for the Go Dirty Girl 5k Mud Run they were a great added touch!
4.0,Works great with fitbit
4.0,"Exactly as described,  I like it.  Good length."
4.0,Great product. Wear them all the time. They are comfy.
4.0,is cute & looks great
4.0,"I'm actually very pleasantly surprised by this shirt. I took a chance on it after many reviews said how thin it was. It's not a sweater but it's really not as thin as I expected. I ordered a size larger because I like shirts to fit losely, I would've normally ordered a size 8-10 but instead got the 12-14 and it fits just the way I like. Very happy with this purchase"
4.0,"I purchased this hat for our family vacation to Orlando where it can get really hot. I wore to work so I can break it in. The only issue I have are the side panels at the bottom seems to be a little long for me. The material and construction of this hat are well made. It's very stylish. The side panel also has a mesh material for good ventilation. Inside of the hat has an elastic sweat band for comfort or more room. I tested the hat under water it holded up, in case of rain. I love the long bill which keeps the sun from my face and eyes. Over all a good hat with a good price!"
4.0,"I really love this extender but it ran a bit larger then I like, but its still very pretty so will keep it and make it work!"
4.0,They’re super cute but kind of cheap
4.0,"Very nice and cute for the price. I am standardly a medium and even went by the size measurements, but the jacket is about 2 inches from snapping. I was surprised, as other reviews are not having problems with size. I am 5/7 and 150 lbs. I returned it, but will reorder in a larger size."
4.0,Cute hoops for the price. A little heavy but not uncomfortable. The hook clasp in the back gets stuck sometimes and need to push hard to close. Overall worth it for the price!
4.0,nice fit. sturdy elastic and soft cotton.
4.0,"Product design was great but quality wasn’t a five, but seller provided 5 star customer service props to him"
4.0,"Nike makes good quality sports bras. This one does feel a little more snug and not as stretchy as I expected for medium support, but overall a good value. Color is more blue than purple"
4.0,"Works with the PS4 but it is a little buggy. I bought two of them and both of them have the same issue. Every 5 minutes the controller becomes unreadable by the PS4 so you have to unplug it, plug it back in, and push the PS button to get back to playing the game. I'm also having an issue in the new Tomb Raider game where I lose control of the camera every few minutes for a second and it just spins all over the place while I'm trying to move my character and the left trigger button is uber sensitive so I keep drawing my weapon at awkward times. So far I've only noticed it with the one game but you should be aware that it might have compatibility issues with your games as well as your console."
4.0,very comfortable looks good
4.0,"My sister noticed the good quality if of the material right away. She loves Min Yoongi, so I knew she would love this. I felt kind of bad the text wasn't in Korean, but she didn't mind at all. So, review based on what my sister thinks. I'm just really glad I could gift her something so nice!"
4.0,"After one wash, it unraveled by the wrist.  Love the color."
4.0,"I find strange that people expect ""Max Mara"" quality from $30 skirt. For the price this skirt is really well made and very cute looking ! I buy clothing in wide array of stores, from Ted Baker to H&M, and IMHO this skirt is well made. I was surprised that it has any kind of lining at all for this price and outer material is mimicking look of a wool really well ! It is thick, soft and very warm. Sizing is OFF definitely and I ordered waaayyyy up to compensate but I received the skirt that is too big *sigh. I usually wear M or L in skirts (USA sizing) and ordered 4X which is way too big on me. It is definitely a size bigger but possibly 2 so I am debating if I should exchange it or just forget abut it : (..."
4.0,These fun large and I'm ok with that.  I usually buy my son a 1.5 but based on the reviews I went with a 1.  They do look big for a size one but as long as he has room for growth I'll accept that. They are nice and if they hold up well I'll be a returning customer.  I'n not giving 5 stars because today is only the second time he's wearing them and I have to see how they hold up over time.
4.0,Super comfortable but it doesn't have pockets. Golf shorts/skirts need pockets.
4.0,"Really nice quality for the price. Bought it to use as part of a costume but would wear for everyday.  It was comfortable, flowed well and hit the right places"
4.0,"Over all really amazing mask, just smells really bad"
4.0,I would have gave it 5 stars if it didn't come so wrinkled.
4.0,Fit bit doesn't fit as snug as the OEM band. But the band itself is good quality. The kit it comes with to remove the links is pretty good.  The links are good quality and the band looks sharp. Overall a good buy.
4.0,These fit a little smaller than the other Grace Karin items.  But I received so many compliments!  So I like them! HA!  Very cute and very comfortable.
4.0,"I usually buy a 4X but somehow I was sent a 5X which was good because I would not have fit the 4x and I wear a 18/20 in clothes.  The waist shaper does work even though I think it runs a little small.  Unsure if I will reorder, I will make that decision after I use it to see how it holds up."
4.0,Great sunglasses. Case is a bit bulky but definitely blocks alot of the sun out and not too dark. I love that it gives a little extra room to put them on without breaking the hinge.
4.0,"This is a shirt, Not a dress!!! Way too short"
4.0,"This is an overall good boot/shoe dryer. It folds up really compact for easy storage and gets air much further into my boots than simple air drying ever could. I do wish that you could up the heat a little to speed up the process, but it will eventually dry out even soaked shoes. The timer is another nice feature so that you're not cooking your leather boots should you forget about them. I would recommend this product."
4.0,"nothing wrong with it, i just dont leave it on in the night."
4.0,This was a gift and I have not received any negative feed back.  It was easy to charge even in low light and it looked great.
4.0,"Looks great, feels good when I wear it, and weights light! My only complaint is that it didn't come with any product information card."
4.0,These are functional straps for hanging small swords and sabers and work perfectly well. They are just a bit long and make a saber hang too low.
4.0,"Give good support, my legs/ feet feels good at the end of the day"
4.0,"The only problem i have with these socks are that they go past the knee but not really up to your thighs, they are still really cute and comfortable anyways"
4.0,I just purchased another one of these dresses for a friend and shipped it to her. She took a picture to show me how cute she looks and the PRINT IS UPSIDE DOWN :( so bummed since I can’t return it and she has to wear it like that. I guess you get what you pay for. It seems mass produced and not really paid attention to to sew the print upside down in front and right side up in the back.
4.0,Really cute just size up if you’re normally an XL if they don’t have a bigger size i wouldn’t recommend this brand :/
4.0,"It is okay to use it for part of the Halloween costume, but all lights makes the mask to get hotter and harder for breathing."
4.0,"Love these, the backs bend easily though."
4.0,I purchased these rings for my husband and will be giving them to him for Christmas. The quality of these look to be very good and I like the colors. He should be very happy with these silicone rings. Thanks.
4.0,"I bought this for several pants with elasticized waistbands. They work perfect, no belly bulge. I bought a thinner belt for shorts with smaller belt loops. the only downside is the buckle catches on the belt loops as your thread it through your pants. But definitely a keeper, pleased with the purchase."
4.0,Super easy to put on for a 6- year old. Only thing is that the front runner gets worn down really easy. After two weeks of wear the rubber was worn down.
4.0,I wanted to be Mother Nature this year for Halloween but when I looked online for headpieces the prices were insane. So I decided to make my own. This was the perfect base to make my vision come to life. Could be a little more sturdy but then again I added a lot to it as well.
4.0,This is a good looking watch. The band however is a different story.  I would have to agree with another reviewer that the band is too thin for this watch. It was a pain to size it for my wrist. But so far this watch has been pretty accurate.
4.0,"This dress is really cute and comfortable. The material is a little thin and I wish that it didn't fit quite so tight,  but it's still fun to wear. I would recommend getting it one size up so that it's more comfortable.<br /><br />I received this product at a discounted price from the seller in exchange for my honest review."
4.0,This dress is pretty good.  I got an XL and it was a tad bit smaller than I was expecting and didn’t have much stretch to it.  It felt like it was almost too short. It wasn’t too short and maybe it just felt odd because it had a bit of a tighter feel than I was expecting and didn’t have as much stretch as I anticipated.  I got the dark green and it is a great color and good dress.  I threw a cape sweater over it just because I felt it was a tad tight and short and I liked it much better.  I have a similar dress from years ago that is super stretchy and flowy and that’s what I expected with this dress and it just wasn’t the same.  Overall good dress and I don’t know that I would recommend sizing up but it is ever so slightly on the smaller side
4.0,"Sexy and comfortable at the same Time! Good quality, I have washed and worn several times."
4.0,"The gloves do keep your hands warm and dry. However, they are a bit bulky.  Difficult to work in if you use your hands for intricate work outside."
4.0,"I tried these first when a friend offered.  I have an issue with my right ankle to about 5 inches above.  After wearing only 1 to walk just over 10 miles my leg still felt great.  I ordered for a few upcoming breast cancer walks so color didn't matter.  I have tried using just one at night and when putting it on, I leave it mid-foot about the arch so the length is good.<br />The only reason I rated a 4 instead of 5 is the ban at the bottom is a little tight on the right ankle. Sometimes I fold it up or leave it over the heel."
4.0,Light and comfortable. Although a little large on the chest area.
4.0,"Color is a little darker than seen here, however good material. Has some stretch fits well"
4.0,"I liked the shirt, it fit nicely, and was exactly how it’s described- my ONLY THING is the collar was stretched."
4.0,"This 18K gold bracelet set would make an excellent gift for tweens, teens and others. The initial bracelet has 4mm beads strung on elastic. The other two are 6” metal chain with 2” extensions. Metal clasps work smoothly."
4.0,Super washable and stylish. Lost a button at the first wash though…
4.0,"Package arrived quickly. I ordered a large, the top fit a little too big but the bottoms fit perfectly."
4.0,Don't get to Pierce my ear so work don't judge me 😛. They look very nice
4.0,These socks are good for the price but need to make sure the many loose strings inside the sock don't get caught up in your toes.
4.0,Backs dont work
4.0,Will use to a football game.
4.0,It was nice. Perfect for my granddaughter.
4.0,"I have a small collection of different animal hoods. I love wearing them around my house.<br />The purple is beautiful! It has black on the top of the fur which gives it a luxurious look.<br />It's slightly smaller than most animal hoods, which I don't mind.<br />I marked it down a star because the stitching is a little off around the front of the hood and at the top and it gives it a bit of a odd look. The paws are upside down and a section of fur was sewn in the seam.<br />Overall, I really love it so I don't want to deal with an exchange. Mine is a little unique 💜"
4.0,"The dress looks exactly like in the product pictures. It fits true to size. I got it in M, which is my usual size.<br />The dress is cute and has pockets. However, the workmanship is not great. There were many loose threads at the seams. I pulled them off, so no biggy. I'm not a fan of material either. It is not high quality.<br />But the dress looks cute and fits great. I would rate it 4-stars and recommend it."
4.0,"I got 39 pieces instead of 40 but ni big deal. Good quality just some odd pieces in there that I have no clue where I could ever use them. But still worth the price for those I will use. It would be nice is each gauge was bagged & labeled separately though. I didn't get any eyebrow bars, which I was hoping for. But i will definitely order this again as it was still worth the price for the few I will use. Others I will give away to friends."
4.0,My daughter loved it. I thought it could have had a little more taste.
4.0,Have worn this to many compliments - well worth the price - keep it simple with a solid color dress or top and feels great - like this vendor -
4.0,Están lindos el color cambia poco pero a mi hija le gustan mucho
4.0,"5 stars because my granddaughter loves it. And hers does have a zip closer.<br />3 stars for quality.<br />1 stars for discription. Not at all as pictured or discribed. The white fluffy lining is flat with red stains inside the ""jacket."" Around the hood is a mix of white, tan and browns fur. No loining in the arms at all. Definitely not for a Michigan winter coat."
4.0,Bought this for my sister's fiance to take to work he seems to like it keeps his drinks cool
4.0,I would've given a 5 if it had a better chain & if the hole for the chain was bigger would've love to put it on a tennis necklace .  Will not fit any necklace bigger than a 1.5 mm
4.0,It's a very cute dress. I wish I would have ordered it in a size large though. Will work great as a beach cover-up for me. It is very comfy material
4.0,Bery well made and delivered promptly.  Was not  satisfied  with the cooling aspect felt<br />Like every other mask. I did order more because of the comfort
4.0,"Overall, this dress is really nice. The material, well not knitted, is very good quality and feels really solid, not flimsy at all. The sleeves are so nice, and go all the way down, fitting perfectly. I am returning it however, only due to the fact that the cut/style is not flattering on my body. I am 5'5, 170lb, and wear a 36 D. I think if the seam around the waist had been lower, more toward the hips rather than under the chest, it would look nicer for girls with larger chests. The dress itself is really nice though, so I'm bummed it didn't work out."
4.0,I really like the level of compression on these socks especially when i am on my feet for most of 16 hours shift. my only complain is sometimes my toes feel really compressed too
4.0,Love love love this dress!!! There is a loose stitch in the v neck but it’s so pretty I’ll fix it myself.
4.0,Watch is in very good condition. New and beautiful. Only issue is the box it came in. Generally the box for Bambino is bracelet box but I got the box in which *** orient comes. The box was also not right size for a Bambino
4.0,"I like it a lot but it looks a lot more like a toy in real life, would purchase for a kid but not adults/teens."
4.0,Super comfortable! Fits a little tighter than I expected (36DD and bought according to chart). Not sure if the padded cups will stay in place when washed.
4.0,Nice mask but shipping takes forever!
4.0,"This  is  a  beautiful  COPY photograph and  signature. The  seller  should  be  more  careful  to  make this  clear, that  it  is  not  the  actual  signature,  but  a  photo copy. It  is however,  perfect  for the  shadow  box  display  It  was  purchased  for."
4.0,It was smaller than I thought had to wear tires with it but other than that I love it
4.0,"$30 hat but very comfortable.  Fits perfectly.  Doesn't breathe very well but no vent holes either.  To dress mine up a bit and add a splash of color, I added a feather to mine.  Looks sharp with a grey or black sport jacket."
4.0,Beautiful his/her set. Good deal for the price.
4.0,They were just a tad bit too little for my 3 year old but overall cute!
4.0,"Cute,  collar lays a bit awkwardly,  but a nice cardigan"
4.0,Perfect as a diffuser when traveling but be careful- I have lost two of the diffusers just taking off a jacket
4.0,"Good quality. Very, very wide. Much more than I expected."
4.0,"These are super cute. My kids and I split the pack between us. The metal backs on them are junk. Luckily, I keep a package of the rubber backs for lapel pins since I collect them to wear on my lanyard at school. I highly suggest ordering a pack of the rubber pin backs from amazon to use with these."
4.0,Purchased small and they fit loose but comfortable for physical therapy. Only issue is they shrank in length after washing cold and dryer set on low. I’m 5’ 3 and pants length are more like a petite now.
4.0,"It looks fantastic, fits well.  I will give it 5 stars if it holds up<br />once I start wearing it.  Have only tried it on, haven't worn it out.<br />It may not be very durable....we'll see.  But beautiful and sexy."
4.0,The shoes fit perfect like the color & style
4.0,Be sure to wash in cold water and dry on flat surface.
4.0,"I rarely wear slippers in the house but I do need them for outside, walk the dog or get the mail. I have a gravel walkway and slippers that you can just slip on and walk across the rocks, yes!  I chose yellow and it's very yellow and bright.  So far I'm pretty happy with the slippers."
4.0,"Love the pattern, color, dress fit except the length.  Everyone had reviews touting how long it is...  but that is a different color as this one is way short!  I am keeping it and having it turned into a knee length dress.  So comfy/cute!"
4.0,Good. Size is correct.
4.0,Smaller than depicted in the photo but still good.
4.0,"I read the reviews before purchasing. My girl is on the slimmer side and is 17 months old.  I got the XS and they are slightly loose on the leg openings but not by much. Overall I am very happy with them and really like that they are thicker, it defidently helps with accident clean up."
4.0,"Really good quality. I ordered the black and blue &#34;bundle&#34; and they look pretty good and true to color. Keeps your head warm while looking cute. It's true that it feels a little bit large for me, but I am overall satisfied with the purchase."
4.0,"I was super impressed with this costume. The price in comparison to what all is included is great! I ordered up a size, I'm typically wear a Large, but I'm always worried about it being to small. But the only thing on this costume that was tight was the ribbon around the sleeves.<br /><br />The stitching on the garment over all is a little hit and miss, but overall it's a great costume."
4.0,"This jacket was marketed as a men’s size, however, the size 3xl fits like a women’s large/extra large. I’m 5’2”, 135 lbs. and have short arms and it’s a little long in the sleeves and length, but fits ok if you tuck the sleeves and the length under just a little. Overall, I like this jacket, because it’s actually warmer than expected and it’s not bulky."
4.0,It is shorter in length than I was expecting.
4.0,"These were far larger than I was expecting. Slightly blue, but not unpleasant looking. Great for everyday wear. Backs are plastic with metal center, seem very secure. Great value for the metal used (white gold vs sterling at a similar price). C&C warranty card included, warranty registration on their site was simple & straightforward. I'm definitely a fan of C&C Moissanite.<br /><br />Update - almost a year later one of the backs came off and I thought I'd lost it. I found it thankfully but I think I'll have to find some that are in fact more secure. Over time they are not as snug as I'd previously thought. For the price these should come with better backs. Reduced rating to 4 stars."
4.0,"I loved the look and the glasses had great reviews.  I wanted to love them and I tried to love them, but the polarized lens just weren't that great.  I've had a pair of Ray Ban Polarized Wayfarers for 10 years that I was going to replace with these.  I really couldn't even tell these glasses were polarized!  I also have a small face, and these looked like they would be a perfect size.  However, I found that the way they sat on my face didn't give enough coverage.  I could see sunlight from the sides.  Beautiful glasses!  Just not the right fit for me.  Hopefully the Ray Bans will hold up a while longer while I continue the hunt…"
4.0,Great for the costume party...took the house down...
4.0,The print on this shirt is beautiful. I have bought this as a Christmas present for my son so I can't really speak to the fit but I will say it does look to be a little on the smaller side. I will definitely come back and update my review once he has a chance to try it on. I think I am going to be an awesome Mom Christmas morning for this  one. Thank you.
4.0,They work really well. They are worn most sunny days. I work outside most days.
4.0,Nice accessory for a sweater.
4.0,"Nice earrings, was just really looking to find a deep dark blue pair, and the pictures made me think that’s what I’d get. Not so much. But it’s ok, I’ll live!"
4.0,"My wife Purchased this coverup for a trip to St. Kitts. The color was great, she’s 5’11” and the coverup didn’t actually cover everything up. Ha but would be great for someone shorter"
4.0,I really like the soft fabric and the stretch it has. I ordered a 1X which fits like a large that is not loose at all. I wanted it to glide over the body and not cling. I am definitely not putting it in the dryer.
4.0,"Really cute however medium runs big on me (I'm 5'1&#34; and fit) so that's disappointing, also need a slip dress under for sure."
4.0,I didn't think at this price that the bag would hold up as well as it has! The flap tends to get scratches on it easily but other than that it's a great bag. I put my smaller bag and a lunch for work in it plus a bunch of other stuff and it handles it very well. The only thing I would change is that at it's size it can get heavy when full so I wish there was a cushion type thing on the strap
4.0,"fit nicely, looks like picture, easy to put on"
4.0,"It's a bit small for a 6'3"" 225 guy. By putting my arms in it and raising it over my head I was able to wiggle into it. Chest, shoulders and arms were all tight but I got it on. Getting it off was another challenge. I ended up getting assistance from the wife who was delighted to assistance with her husband's stupid project.  Tugging, pulling, rolling, laughing and 10 minutes later it was off.<br />  Links are rough cut and have some sharp edges. Putting it on and especially removing it was uncomfortable and I lost a bit of my 1/2 long hair to the links.  Some of the links have tool marks but not a big deal.<br />  Links bend pretty easy. I'm not sure if it was me and my struggles or if it was crafting but a lot of the links were poorly butted. Length of the shirt was to my waistline and sleeves ended above the elbow.<br />  It's a heavy costume piece. If you're thinking about getting this to weld the links, I strongly suggest you read up on the dangers of welding galvanized steel.<br />  For those who are actually looking for armor to protect them, this isn't it. It would definitely protect against moderate slashing but piercing blows would bend the rings apart.  Look for riveted or welded links, and expect to pay more than you would for a 3A vest"
4.0,"Okay, I have a very high instep. Will add velcro to adjust the fit"
4.0,Quality fairly good. Could have been a little better but I still love it
4.0,Perfect wedding gift for my brother
4.0,love it! material slightly itchy but for price it is great. not as dramatic in the back I don't think (as pictured) just enough.
4.0,Its really cute kind of big but will see if it fits by winter
4.0,its a nice looking shirt gave it as a gift
4.0,Very pretty. Using it to go in a brooch bouquet
4.0,Lace Trim is too narrow. It fits but would be better if it was wider.
4.0,It's pretty! I got it on time
4.0,Finally a suit I can wear. Looks good -  hoping to find more like it.
4.0,Fiance' Liked it a lot
4.0,"Wish it was a bit longer with a curved hem, but fits well and is comfortable. I can see it being a go-to staple in my wardrobe."
4.0,Good fit. Very good quality
4.0,"Very pretty and comfortable, runs a little big"
4.0,"I really really love this time piece but I'm having one small problem with itthe (2) pins on the sides keep coming out and as a result of this (both) pins are missing , if I have to I will purchase the pins from you if I could my order #116-2528077-4613822<br />Thank you"
4.0,Awesome fit...
4.0,The vest is very comfortable and able to make adjustments for jacket size. Would have given a 5 but it does not have 3 settings. Only rapid flashes or no flash. The slow flash does not exist.
4.0,"Nice set, earrings worry me because the backs are hard to get on"
4.0,very confy!
4.0,It looks like the top is a print but it is kind of a lace-like overlay with a white polyester underlay. When you are in a pool the lace fabric floats up. I tacked mine to the underlay fabic.
4.0,I bought a little mermaid set and received a Tinkerbell set. They did there best to reimburse me.
4.0,large 36  small for 32
4.0,"This shoe was so big, like clowns shoes. I had my child's feet measured two days prior to purchasing these and still the size was off. Again, would have kept shoe if I had the time to return the item and received the proper size in time for our event. K"
4.0,"I also bought in black. The red is more of a hot pink and a bit see through. Make sure you have proper underwear.<br />I am 5'9 and 168 and the Medium fits well. It's snug, but does have a bit of compression, so it holds everything in. I wear them backwards, which shows ample cleavable. Very sexy."
4.0,My only complaints are that it's short waisted for a full bust or someone with a long torso.
4.0,"nice cheap glasses! already lost them, but we had a good ride!"
4.0,"Very cute little wallet!  I love that the change compartment is zippered.  And there are so many card slots!  I am loving this wallet.  The colors and pattern are true to the online pictures, and it seems very well made."
4.0,I don't even know I'm wearing it. Band is a bit thinner than I expected.  Only time will tell how long it will last.  I like that it has a pattern so it looks less like a silicone ring. Wish they sold matching mens and womens bands.
4.0,Great quality coat. Very warm. I ordered this jacket taking a chance from ordering online. I saw that they ran a little small so I ordered a size up. It was still smaller than I would have liked and ended up returning the coat because I found one that I could try on in person that fit better and was more comfortable in.
4.0,I have such a hard time finding plus size clothes that are actually true to size but fits perfect. I have washed it and dried it with no colors fading or shrinking. The material is really soft and comfortable. It great to pair with some jeans for a quick casual look.
4.0,"I ordered this to wear under a uniform. I had been searching for a few years now. This one finally popped up! A navy blue merino wool women’s regular collar base layer!!! It’s lightweight and a tad see thru, but I will be wearing it under a uniform top so it’s perfect. I washed it in the washing machine inside out and in a garment bag. Air dried flat. No issues with that."
4.0,Very happy with the quality and how soft it is.<br />Plan on purchasing more in different colors
4.0,Really cute print. This top is a fun boxy cut. Definitely on the big side. Fun to do a half tuck with. The fabric is flowy and flattering. Will fit a variety of body types.
4.0,Fabric quality is good but shirts are on the smaller side.  I would strongly suggest ordering a size larger and maybe two sizes larger if you'd like to put in the dryer.  My husband is not a large man and most shirts are baggie but not these shirts.
4.0,I been using these shirts stays everyday for two years now. These shirt stays have lasted wayyy longer than any other shirt stays I’ve used. The best part is they clip onto ur socks and don’t use that annoying loop that hook stuff onto your feet. I will definitely buy again if these ever wear out.
4.0,This sweatshirt runs a little small . It’s kind of on the thin side but I like it.
4.0,"Fit well, seem like they'll hold up, very soft."
4.0,These slippers are very well made and comfortable.  The only problem is that they run a bit large.
4.0,Fit as expected. Its Comfortable.  The color is a nice shade but linen wrinkles. Its Too much work for a casual dress.
4.0,"Description Needs to be more precise with sizing..<br />Although a good product. I ordered a size XXL (fits like a 14/16) I am a 5 ft female, weight 120 and this fits perfect"
4.0,The bottoms were not quite as high as pictures but fits well and is a great suit. Made me feel comfortable chasing around a 2 year old!
4.0,"Came with different colors or it would be a 5 star rating. Small, durable, and comfortable."
4.0,"Yes,it look nice."
4.0,Cute winter hat.
4.0,Runs a bit small. I bought an xl and the fabric was thin. Could see all my books and crannies in thigh area haha I think one size up would’ve been ok.
4.0,"Beautiful! I admit I originally bought this bracelet to put on a dreamcatcher I made for my son (due to the holes already being there :P ); however, I ended up taking a different route with the dreamcatcher and therefore was able to spare this bracelet. I'm pretty content with the authentic feel of the gemstones. This is a bracelet I plan on wearing quite a bit, now that I was able to keep it in one piece :)"
4.0,"I am 5’3, 130lbs, have c cup breasts and have big shoulders and hips. I wear a size 4/6 in pants. I purchased a medium. This suit fit great! The bottoms are cheeky and theres good support in the top. I dont really like the straps in the back but oh well! The material feels cheaper but works for me!"
4.0,"It took a while to receive it. When it arrived, it was cheaply packaged and thus the wire was bent. I straightened it out without difficulty. It looks really nice with the pendant (for which I purchased the wire for) hanging from it. The reason I gave it 4 stars is that I think the packaging could have been more sturdy and the arrival time could have been more speedy. Otherwise it is very nice looking and I have gotten several compliments on the pair."
4.0,Adorable. Lightweight. Love the look of these earrings.
4.0,The amulet itself is beautifully made and durable. The chain it is paired with is pointless. I would rather pay more to have a sterling silver chain or have the amulet on a cord or leather strap.
4.0,Occasionally need to pull up due to large...........BUT sooooooooooo  CUTE!!!
4.0,"For those saying that it is cheaply made, if you (like me) aren't willing to pay $100+ for the FinFun brand because they will outgrow it in 2 years then you have to be realistic in that you get what you pay for.<br /><br />For less than $45 (including the monofin which sells for $30 alone at Target) this is exactly what I expected. I ordered the 8-10 for my tall, very thin 8 year old. The waist fits but it is not skin tight throughout the legs which is fine bc it gives her room to grow. Try to avoid dragging their bottom on the side of the pool as the metallic shimmer wears off.<br /><br />The top is indeed big as other reviewers mentioned. I plan on sewing it but with a few criss-crosses and knots I made it work until I can sew it.<br /><br />The monofin needed a bit of tightening, I actually removed the clips on the side and flipped them around otherwise the straps kept pulling through and loosening, allowing her feet to slide out. Now they are tight and as long as she puts the straps high on her ankle her feet don't come out.<br /><br />Plus shipping only took 10 days. We were expecting 4-5 weeks from China so my daughter was thrilled!"
4.0,The slit kept sliding in the middle instead of the side
4.0,"lovely dress for church or an event, it's a tad too loose but I think a LG would have been too tight, but will never know since I didn't purchase a lg<br />it's worth the price. I am 5'7 180 lbs, 38 C, thick at the shoulders and back<br />the torso part of the dress is too high for my waist area, so if you have a long torso you may not want to buy this dress but if you have a short one it'll be perfect"
4.0,Great band. I wear it everyday for about 7 months and the band is starting to peel a little bit and the blue is starting to stain the white part.
4.0,Very nice looking. More suitable for women than unisex
4.0,My son ( age 32) loves these.  Very comfortable. Only reason for the four stars is PRICE. Way expensive.  My brother - in - law said wow for that price they better hug his nuts.  Guess what they do. LOL
4.0,"I'm a size 6-8, and bought this in the red buffalo check, in size Med.  It was very fitted.  This is an Asian design so be sure you size up... way up.  I should have gotten a large to have the loose look I was wanting."
4.0,Love the look. Vibrant color!
4.0,It’s a little big but great for when I want something dressy.
4.0,"I have now come back and bought two sets of these. My 9 year old is wearing them to school. These are her favorite for a mask.  Warning be careful when washing the colors do bleed.  I was them all together now with a color catcher and no problems. I even dry in dryer. As much as we are having to wash they will not last forever but for comfort and price i have more than got my moneys worth.  As for fit reference, they fit my 4 year old and 9 year old but is too small for my 11 year old to wear comfortably. I will probably purchase more colors."
4.0,I accidentally ordered a large which worked out well for me. I normally prefer items to be looser and typically get a medium but the large is snug. Main zipper feels pretty cheap but other material is high quality and very cozy. Pink color is as depicted as well.
4.0,"Thus band for my Apple Watch perfectly. I didn’t have to struggle putting it in, it fit just right. Color and material is exactly what I expected."
4.0,Cute dress! A little longer than expected
4.0,I absolutely love these tanks and the material and fit. They’re snug but stretchy and they’re a good cut around my shoulders and my back. My only wish is that they were a teeny bit longer. I have large boobs so they barely cover to my belly button. Other than the length they’re are great
4.0,I purchased this too large. Liked the style. If you're a medium I would suggest a small.
4.0,"My grandson loves the lights and he was the hit of daycare.  However, it grew old really fast and he doesn't even wear them any more."
4.0,"I’m between a small and medium and decided to order the medium because I prefer a looser fit. It is plenty large and I could probably wear the small, but the size medium will work. It is a bit shorter than I anticipated. I will wear with leggings most likely. I ordered the hot pink and the color is great and very bright just as advertised."
4.0,The fabric is see through. I got the pink top with pink and blue flowers on skirt. It’s beautiful and receive many compliments but I must wear a slip and jacket with it.
4.0,Ran smaller than I liked great quality though
4.0,got these for my boyfriend and he loves them! he’s a little rough when them and they eventually tear but this is the only kind he will buy! he loves how soft they are
4.0,"I probably didn't use it for what it was meant for, but for my Halloween costume, it was perfect. A little tighter than expected, I'd go up a size if you're questioning. From what I remember, it had a drawstring as well so you don't have to worry about it slipping down if you order up."
4.0,"Good shirt. Color is not a bright, hunter orange. Has a darker tone. My only thing is, once washed and dryed it shrunk about a size down."
4.0,"As previously mentioned the sizing is about 1 size small so if you normally wear a 32, go ahead and get the 34 which I didn't do. Also, the description led me to believe the crotch would be gusseted or reinforced which I don't think is actually the case."
4.0,Dry quickly and feel comfortable.
4.0,"Didn't know the band was plastic, but over all a good product."
4.0,"Great strap. No complaints now that I'm wearing it, but price is a bit much for a (quality) piece of nylon. Solid hardware, and no loose threads or inconsistencies throughout."
4.0,"Used this product on an upstairs patio that we wanted to make more toddler friendly.  Very happy with the end result - but had to give a 4 (not five) star review due to obvious factory damage to the roll of material.  A significant hole had been poked into the roll (decreasing in diameter as it went deeper into the layers) that was NOT through the outer packaging.  In the end, only I could see the small flaws, so the wife and son are still happy."
4.0,"typical Converse fit, a bit snug all around for size, especially with socks, but once you realize that it's always the case with Converse, it's expected.<br />it's a beautiful shoe, and it looks great with jeans. I don't bother to lace up, just tied the laces at the top hole. nice and heavy shoe"
4.0,cute earrings stayed in ear
4.0,"My husband has restless legs and they are aggravated more by frequent air travel. He tried them on a recent flight and had no issues with what he was looking to fix, which he was impressed with. But his knees were aching. They did not before. He’ll keep trying them"
4.0,Flowy but cute!!
4.0,"I purchased these earrings about two months ago but last night was the first time I wore them and I have to agree they only show the  design on one side also they are so hard to hook up, they are cute but I get what u pay for"
4.0,I bought this bc I wanted it to be decoration so I didn’t really care about comfort but I did try it on and it looked nice.
4.0,These shoes are well constructed and very cute. I love the selection of colors and chose pink for my niece. I suggest using socks with these to prevent any irritation from the glitter that may come in contact with the baby's ankle. The glitter does rub off so I gave this a 4 star rating. I received this product at a discount for an honest review.
4.0,Terrible to break in- causing multiple blisters but worth it.
4.0,Button Down Romper is cute and fit well.  My only complaint about it is that it started to snag a little after one day of wearing but I guess you get what you pay for.
4.0,Fit my 5 year old just ok
4.0,"seems to be a little tighter then they say, if your a guy with 48 inch chest buy a 2X and you will be happy XL is is a little to snug."
4.0,"I got this for my 11 year old daughter and it fits her nicely - so as other reviewers have mentioned this might be more for juniors.<br />You do have to assemble the buckles on the straps and there’s no instructions, so good luck figuring that out - we just kind of winged it."
4.0,"***Update from 5 stars to 4*** There are tiny little white fuzzes on the dress that wont come off. I'm still going to wear it and it is still cute, but it doesn't look that great.<br /><br />Seriously so cute. I got a large and it fits great. I'm 5'6 and it falls maybe 2 inches above my knee. I'm about 165 lbs and carry most of my weight in my hips and butt. Material is soft and comfortable. I'm wearing it at work with a little black cardigan over it. When I leave work I'll take the cardigan off and it will be the perfect summer dress!"
4.0,the color was not as bright as it looked online
4.0,"I really like this watch.  Accurate, solar powered, atomic clock syncing, and just a good looking watch.<br /><br />I'd been watching the price on this watch for over a year and it finally dipped down into the good deal range right before Christmas and with Amazon Prime's free shipping I had to get it.  Saved over $150 off of MSRP.  Seemed like a no brainer."
4.0,Exactly what I needed for my wedding
4.0,"Small but tasteful.  Certainly not a quality item, but none the less it has it's charm.  Pleased."
4.0,"the dress is fine. It runs large. I would ask the seller to make a thicker underlay so it isn't see through. It's pretty but that would be better. For the price, it's good."
4.0,"The watch band does not match the rest of the watch, so I replaced it with a black metal one (it broke, and I'm waiting for the replacement from Amazon...but that is another story)."
4.0,"I am a Medical Assistant, and wear these to work under my scrubs. I love them!  I only wish they weren’t quite so tight. I normally wear a Large in shirts and scrubs, but I got the XL knowing they would be tight, and I didn’t want them to ride up. I really should have ordered the XXL."
4.0,"My wife loves these Laurel Burch designs.  When I needed a small birthday gift for her, I found that my local store no longer carried the Laurel Burch products.  Amazon to the rescue. She was pleased and I was pleased."
4.0,"Pockets are small and material is very thin, but it’s comfortable and fits well"
4.0,"Initial thoughts are that the belt seems sturdy.  However, beware on the sizing.  I ordered to match what I typically wear and it's a tight fit without using the hole punching tool (that was oddly included as a bonus item)."
4.0,Quality is very good but it fits like I am wearing kids one.
4.0,Love the look and style but bracelet clasp is difficult to open. Have to squeeze my wrist thru bracelet to wear.
4.0,Comfortable and washable.
4.0,"These are nice. Not really compression but lightweight and comfkortable. I am 38 bust, 28 waist nd 36 hips and got the large. Fit but not snug."
4.0,Yellow color not as vibrant but still cute!
4.0,They were pretty but I didn’t realize how small they would be.
4.0,"Item was of good quality, but measurements are off on this item.  Need to order two sizes larger than the owner's measurements on the item."
4.0,"The reviews were right, the inside makes a crunchy noise, and you can tell that this is a cheap purse...but hey, what do you want for the price!? I haven't been using as a purse, but more of a book bag for when I go to meetings and such. Plenty of storage pockets! I wish it weren't so orange colored, and more the tan/brown that it shows in the pictures. I like it though and will continue to use it!"
4.0,"I love these glasses, they fit great and love the color options"
4.0,"This was ordered as a gift, which I haven’t given as yet, so can’t comment on how it will wear or launder.  I can tell you that the cape is lovely and appears to be well made, the piping around the collar is so pretty.  I ordered the sage and the color is just beautiful.  It is a bit long for a bed jacket but don’t think that will be a problem.  I would have given five stars except that I was so disappointed with the packaging. It was bunched up and stuffed into a small plastic bag-I’ll definitely have to iron it.  More importantly, though, I am happy with the purchase and think my friend will be happy with it, too."
4.0,Good shirt but very high up to your neck it is more annoying to keep tugging it away from my neck
4.0,My boyfriend was very excited to get this stretching kit.
4.0,The colors on this mask are so vibrant! The feathers away the top stood tall and the elastic wasn't too tight. The earrings are simple yet cute. I only took off 1 star because the earrings are super lightweight and do not come with a back. I lost them before even making it to my event.
4.0,"Absolutely gorgeous dress, only issue that was run into was the neck being tighter then first thought. We bought a size XL and it ran more like a large. Otherwise, material felt great and looked awesome"
4.0,Good to the price
4.0,I like colors and fabric.  Size is way too small.  I wear M in aero designs cycling jersey and ended up getting XXL for this jersey as XL felt too tide in the hips.
4.0,"It took forever to get this delivered, I had to contact the seller and they re-shipped, which did get to me in a timely manner. The seller was very responsive and resolved my issue, The top is beautiful well made but runs very small. I think ordered at least a size up but should have ordered two sizes up."
4.0,"I really like these bras. I only one complaint, the flat plastic rob come out of one of the bras. I don't really mind because it doesn't change the fit or comfort."
4.0,Very traditional pin cushion.
4.0,"I rated this a four because the rubber piece keeps coming out I feel like it's a little big, but I love the color and it's a big case."
4.0,"Beautiful wallet, the coulour is exactly as it's shown. It feels sturdy in the hand and durable. I've already transferred my things from my old wallet. I haven't worn it in pants yet so I would have to give and update when I do. I give this review 4 stars because the olny con I've seen so far is the size. Why is it so big?! I didn't expect it to be so large because I even measured my old wallet by the dimensions given and they're both around the same size, so I was very surprised when I received it. Other than that it's good so far. I would definitely advise that you buy the updated version because that's what I plan to do in the near future."
4.0,"It wus amazing took a little bit but that’s OK but they need to put more work on the gloves because my left glove ripped when I first put it and The Cape was extremely heavy, kept on, pulling up my shirt, other than that amazing product"
4.0,Very happy with my bracelet and the explanation given by the seller. Was a bonus as I wanted more for my essential oils
4.0,"Very cute, and at a great price. was just as I expected."
4.0,Over all good fit the extra piece that tucks away is uncomfortable
4.0,"Great hat but took forever to get here. Other than that, no complaints."
4.0,"Beautiful skirt and great quality, but had to return it and order a size up because it fit too tightly around the waist. The larger size fits perfectly. Great skirt to wear in cold weather, I love it!!"
4.0,"I searched everywhere online for an Alice in Wonderland costume, and with a little hesitation I decided on this one... and I'm so glad I did!!<br />It's super cute, and not shiny or cheaply made like Halloween Store costumes. It even included the headband, which i wasn't expecting!<br />You do need to order up a size or so though; I'm a 5'6&#34;, 130lb female and the large fit almost perfectly. My only complaints are that the skirt is a tad small and the sleeves are a tad big."
4.0,"Nice fit, nice look."
4.0,You can't really see the silicon grips but they work for me.  These are as cute as they look in the pictures.  I'm totally going to purchase more.
4.0,"Size down for sure, it’s stretchy and roomy. Only reason for the 4 is the length. All of the reviews stated how long it was. I am 6ft and it reaches my ankles. I will still wear it and it looks cute, I was just looking forward to a dress that finally hits the ground. If you are 6ft it won’t hit the ground."
4.0,Very cute but a bit bigger than I would prefer.
4.0,"Only issue, and a minor one, is that the band gets loose after a while and I have to adjust it"
4.0,"The ring I ordered was suppose to be an 11. I somehow got a 10. Lucky it fix on my finger but just barely. Good service and product though , it looks so much like Alaric’s."
4.0,I read review for 5' 4&#34; 140# and she got medium and picture looked great. My height & weight so bought I medium.  I can wear it but more comfortable in top in large.
4.0,"I bought this tie from Yekiua for my brother, who is a chef that specializes in preparing different chicken dishes.  He loved the tie when I gave it to him.  I personally wish that the chickens were less cartoony and more realistic, but he loved it when he received it.  He put it on for dinner that night and said that it was a little bit shorter than the other ties that he wore.  You'd never know it from looking at him when he was wearing it though.<br /><br />No way you're wearing the tie to a formal occasion or wedding like the listing states, but this is a fun tie to wear to events where chickens are featured prominently.  Trade shows, county/state fairs, or chicken-themed festivals would be ideal for wearing this tie.  Yekiua has many different designs that can be worn to a lot of different events.<br /><br />The tie itself is well made with quality stitching.  The tie didn't come with any washing instructions, so it's probably going to the dry cleaner if something gets spilled on it."
4.0,The dress feels comfortable but was a bit too big for me. It wrinkles pretty easily but for the price it isn't too bad. It is a little on the thin side.
4.0,Order a couple sizes up since this item runs small
4.0,"If your going on a long trip your feet will thank you if you wear these.<br />These are High quality matrial make you feel comfortable, breathable and fast drying. Great elasticity and stay up-compressed top holds the sock securely on the calf."
4.0,Nice did not it would so big
4.0,"Very nice bead work, however, the back ground satin is more royal blue than baby blue. Will be returning."
4.0,"I originally order the Khaki front knot shirt in size large.  I am 5'7"", 175lbs (40-35-45).  I have always worn a large and on occasion an x-large.  The first shirt was so big and just wasn't attractive - I returned it.  I then ordered the same front knot shirt in medium, I order it in Khaki and Coffee.  The Coffee shirt fit perfectly, the odd side seams by the knot were placed on an angle and were camouflaged within the fold of the knot.  The Khaki shirt was still significantly larger and the side seam was placed horizontally and stood out and looked odd.  So the same shirt, the same size, different colors - fit differently and were sewn differently.  The material is light weight and soft, the drape with the knot is attractive, the price for the correct size and well sewn shirt is outstanding.  There is just a risk on what you will get but the returns are free so the customer support is there.  That is why despite the issues, I gave 4 stars."
4.0,"I love the charm, but the necklace was to long wanted 16 in. otherwise its pretty and dainty."
4.0,"I love my youngest nephew! He's so cute! These socks match his personality perfectly. He has rather wide feet, so he can tend to go through sock quickly. The material is strong and durable enough that I believe they will last for him and his energy all over the place!"
4.0,These are light weight and are very cute for summer
4.0,One of them had scuffed on and I need a size 7 or 7 1/2 other than that I love the boot just watching to see when they get them in maroon color in that size.
4.0,Cute costume/bodysuit for Halloween.  Paired it with skull scarf and combat boots size small fit well.  I am 5’1” 116 lbs
4.0,It was a bit heavier material than I expected. Definitely not a “summer dress” for Florida! I will be wearing it inside to a musical production. The venue is usually a bit chilly so it should work fine.<br />The color is exactly as shown but somehow seems so much prettier in person! The fabric is so very soft. I can only compare it to a newborns baby blanket. It’ very comfortable too.
4.0,"This was a Christmas gift for another, and she really adored it.  The only reason I'm not giving it a 5 is because the packaging wasn't super glamorous, but the item itself is one she's been wearing since the Holidays.  Very, very nice buy for the money!"
4.0,"Nice shirt, the fabric was too light. I thought it was more cotton and would shrink a bit."
4.0,Nice pocket watch. Kind of a bummer that the face window is plastic and not glass .
4.0,"They looks nice, but its simes like they was not new. this is the only thing that i didn't like , but the quality and the price are nice"
4.0,There worked as expected. Considering my husband had no slippers and going to our local mall was not ever under consideration. They work.
4.0,"I have a cowboy hat that just didn't fit my head right, and the wind would blow it off easily. This hat sizing tape solved my problem. The hat is more comfortable and it stays put.  As others have mentioned, to install, fold down the flap just inside the crown of the hat. Put the tape in the inside of the flap (in locations to accommodate the shape of your head - you might have to stack 2 or more layers of tape for larger gaps), and then fold the flap back into place. That way the tape won't move around and you have the smooth side of the leather band against your head."
4.0,Nice earrings-fast delivery.
4.0,This is beautiful dress. Very pretty and well made. I had to return it because it was a bit large and long on me. I would suggest ordering a size smaller than what you normally wear.
4.0,"I have several styles of Baleaf running pants and these work well for warm-weather runs. The seams are flat and don't irritate me. The hidden pocket is good for a key and a credit card or bus pass and not much more. I wish these had the side pockets that several other Baleaf styles have. I have found that Baleaf can be inconsistently sized across styles and colors, but these fit as I expected."
4.0,Was what my daughter expected...
4.0,"I have used shooting glasses, safety glasses and more recently a pair of HD photo-chromatic lenses that stopped getting dark enough.  This pair of glasses has a nice foam gasket to prevent wind while riding (and it's easily replaceable unlike the HD glasses).  On cold mornings I would usually tear up and look like a drug addict by the time I get to work.  However, the foam gasket also costs this review 1/2 a star.  It is so thick that it pushes the glasses away from my face.  With the supplied strap I can hold the glasses snug to my face.  Also the arms are smooth and do not grip my head or ears very well (- 1/2 star).  Without the gasket the glasses fit pretty well and actually block the wind as well as can be expected.  On short and warm rides I ride without the gasket sometimes.  The semi-ridged case is good to protect the foam or glasses when I'm not using them and they're stuck in a bag on the bike.  Thought pretty hard about getting the polarized set but couldn't justify nearly double the price.  I'm happy with what I got and they're pretty comfortable for weather sealed glasses."
4.0,"These gloves fit as ordered and they are very comfortable.  However, it hasn't been cold enough yet for me to use them so I can't attest to their ability to keep my hands warm.  Thus the four stars."
4.0,Love this dress! I love the patter and the style. Only reason i didnt goce it 5 stars is because it doesn't fit me as perfect as i would have liked. I ordered the 6 and it was too big then ordered the 4. It fits perfect everywhere except for the armpit area. I don't think its the dress necessarily but just my build. I'm pretty wide and muscular in the shoulders.  I'm keeping it though because i love it so much and i can handle the snugness for a wedding or two!
4.0,"Original post below - I really do love this but you really do have to dry clean it only. Don't put in washer or dryer.<br /><br />One of the cutest outfits I've purchased for my girl!! I haven't washed it yet though... I had to iron it (with a hair flat iron, haha) and noticed a little bit of the stitching started coming off so I don't know if it will hold up in the wash. I put her in this for picture day and it was great for that purpose!"
4.0,"A great fit for someone with short legs.  Love the feel, soft and comfortable.  Wish I would have bought another pair"
4.0,"Love these bands, lite nice looking on and ver comfortable compared to the rubber band it comes with.<br /><br />Why no 5 stars is I believe they could have added metal to the watch hook to adjust band instead of plastic."
4.0,"Honestly shocked with the quality of the joggers, they are amazing. HOWEVER... not made for tall people, if you’re 5’10” + I wouldn’t recommend."
4.0,"I like the look. It is a bit longer than some other size small length bands I've had, but still not too long. Getting it fastened? Tricky. Especially when I don't figure in taking five minutes to fasten it, while trying to leave for work. Not as easy to fasten as other bands. It does stay together and I like the hidden end."
4.0,"The shirt is as showin, but is really wide. looks ok since its gathered around the mid section. would prefer a more fitted size."
4.0,Its almost perfect. Sometimes the zippers are hard to operate. I think they are nylon or plastic.
4.0,"It came completely smashed, which surprised me, but then I realized the material and construction allowed for that with no problem fluffing it out. I have a very large head and, as suspected, this was too small. It was worth a shot."
4.0,I have been searching high and low for a supportive bra (38h) that doesn't give me cone boobs. This bra is a perfect fit. The only thing that is a negative is the clasps are a little hard to use with my left over pregnancy carpal tunnel hands.
4.0,The glasses fit fine.  I just thought that they would make more of a difference for night driving.  I would recommend though.  Packaged nicely.
4.0,Left one is always bothering my husband
4.0,"I would say love it, but I'm not a big fan of bright colors.  The gray is actually my favorite color because it's not loud, but I can find it my gym bag.  If I could order a pack with a single color, that would be awesome.<br /><br />I find the width of these to be just perfect."
4.0,"..Fits nicely and is very comfortable. However, when I ordered additional tops in different colors the size was not the same and therefor did not fit like the first one. After the second and third attempts to get a similar top with the same problems I gave up and returned them both and considered myself lucky that at least the first one was nice. Also as other customers pointed out the labels on the top were not Lilbetter.."
4.0,It wraps around well and looks good. Don't like the faux leather material. It makes the belts look cheap.
4.0,"It's smaller than it said it would be so I have a bit of a cleavage problem but other than that it is great, super comfortable"
4.0,"Dress is fabulous! BUT I orderd a small I am 5'1 145 lbs and it was way too long and not form fitting enough. WISH THEY HAD AN EXTRA SMALL.  The dress itself is lovely though. Very elegant and feminine , flowy and a beautiful wine color."
4.0,size 10 1/2 mens. got the large and they fit fine.
4.0,Like the velcro adjustment instead of snap type
4.0,Item arrived as pictured. Seems to be well made.
4.0,Awesome shoe!  Great classic style
4.0,I have a wide face and these glasses look great. The lenses are clear and the glasses don't slip. Only minor issue has been some peeling on the arms.
4.0,It looked nice ultimately but arrived fairly wrinkled. It fits a bit tight around my chest and very loose everywhere else. Lucky for me it wasn’t too long for my 5’4” frame. I was able to tie it off a bit at the bottom and walk around all day.
4.0,This dress was a HUGE hit at a wedding I attended recently. Unfortunately the lining at the waist is super itchy due to the underskirt. If that had not been the case I would’ve given this 5 stars.
4.0,"Fits pretty well, a little tight at chest and hip area but I admit I did not purchase based off measurements.  A bit shorter than I thought--the high/low is a bit higher in front for me at 5'10"". Material was thicker also than some described and polka dots a bit larger than I had thought from pic, but not overkill."
4.0,I wear 2 bras for high impact HIIT and I wear these over another solid bra. They look good and fit also
4.0,"Cotton is soft, a tad small"
4.0,The material is thinner than I thought it was gonna be but it’s comfy and fit true to size
4.0,They run a bit smaller than size marked.
4.0,"Super nice ties only complaint so far is stitching seems super loose, it could just be me but I feel that it's super loose and may be an issue down the road if my boyfriend changed the way each tie was tied ever (I tie them and he just leaves them tied that way for most part removing over head and reusing same knot for months)"
4.0,Wish it were made in a lighter material
4.0,As advertised. But won't hold the larger phones.
4.0,Needs to be more form fitting
4.0,The material was a bit clingy. Fit a little tight but over all a really cute dress. I paired it with black leggings.  Looked cute on.
4.0,"Love the detail,size is good too."
4.0,"I wanted to wear this mask for the party I had coming but it got canceled the last minute m. They look good, n bit scary."
4.0,I really like this blouse but it is a bit over sized. It is a light weight chiffon. I did wear a cami under it as its a bit sheer. . I got the small and I'm 5'6&#34; and 126 lbs. for reference. I would suggest sizing down on this.  I really love the sleeve ties. Very feminine and pretty. Going to get the blue one too.
4.0,"Sadly, I had to return this blouse, as it tends to be too tight in the ruched sleeves, but I really liked the sleeve style.  I would have returned for a larger size, but they didn't the one in stock.  Also, the material is very static-prone, as its 100% polyester.  Light weight blouse material for warmer weather, though, so if you don't mind polyester and have thinner arms (mine are kinda chubby), I recommend this pretty top."
4.0,This is a very cute shirt.  I thought it would be a little thicker because it looks like a sweatshirt and flannel but it's more light weight.
4.0,Picture is good just thin
4.0,Love this dress. Very comfortable and love that it has pockets. I will say the wrinkles are stubborn. But still a great buy
4.0,"I expected the slits to be higher but they’re actually pretty short, so it appears a little more modest than the picture. Also fits and looks better without a bra, so keep that in mind if purchasing this dress."
4.0,"hello, we are giving it &#34;somewhat small,&#34; in that it does not wrap around in front enough, in order for the two  halves to overlap comfortably.<br /><br />I mean, XL, is XL, right? so you'd think there would be enough material.<br /><br />other than that, my wife absolutely loves it,<br /><br />The hood is perfect, by the way, and covers the head and face completely.<br /><br />I wish the other two products that we ordered, not from this company, but still through Amazon, from another company in China,<br />had fit as well.<br /><br />The lingerie that i ordered for my wife, (which was XXL,) wouldn't even fit over her leg, and she is NOT fat, just curvy.<br />So that was VERY disappointing...<br /><br />I gave it to her for Valentine's Day, but since the time to return expired, we are stuck with two pieces that do not fit and cannot return them.<br /><br />Needless to say, we will NEVER order anything, except maybe a robe, through Amazon again.<br /><br />If you are not going to get the sizes right, then at least give sufficient time to return them, especially as it took so long to arrive."
4.0,"I just wish there were more white and pink.  The colors used most.  They were not a big as I thought they were, but they are nice puffs."
4.0,"You get what you pay for. These are not very good quality, but they are also very inexpensive. They are totally working for what I need them for. They look good, but feel a little thin and cheap. I would recommend if you need something quick and cheap."
4.0,"Took a while to arrive. Stiff fabric, really low back, spaghetti straps' awkward fit around the bust"
4.0,like it fits good but material is very thin .
4.0,Soft top.  Fits nicely.  Nice appliqué on front.
4.0,"It looks just as pictured and is very pretty.  I wear a size 8/10 in dresses and the medium is perfect.  I am 5'8, and it is above the knee and not mid-thigh which I like.  Likewise, I love the lace look of the sleeves, and it has stretch for comfort.  This dress is not form fitting and has swing in the skirt.  The red shade is very attractive and is a deeper red and not a bright red."
4.0,"These are actually better than I expected.<br />I wish they had more pairs with the same colors as the heart. Overall, pretty good value for the price."
4.0,"I love the bright color and delux texture, too, but the cut of this blouse is too narrow in the hips."
4.0,Great I added bling to this for my graduate
4.0,"Takes a little bit to heat up, but works pretty good, I’m happy with it."
4.0,I love the material. The top fits just right  but it would have been nice if I could have gotten a size smaller in the  shorts.  Overall its cute and I love it!
4.0,"This a pretty dress, great color same as picture however if you have big boobs, I am a D this literally covers hardly any of it.  This is more designed for a small breast person"
4.0,"Liked the weight and clasp,nice"
4.0,"I love this, however I find the clasp very hard to use since I am arthritic. I hope to fin a solution to this because it is a beautiful necklace and a perfect match for some earring I already have."
4.0,Super cute little short
4.0,"Love this scarf. The colors are great. The fabric is really smooth/soft. It is shorter than I expected but I didn't read specific measurements before buying it. I received it 16 days after ordering it, which seems long, but it was way before the estimated delivery date which was March 9 or after. Overall, I'd definitely suggest this scarf for the price!"
4.0,Very cute dress but things very large.
4.0,Too loose for my wirst. Bummed because it’s actually really cute. Returning for something with a chain. I don’t think I am going to find a stretchy band that fits right. I want it to be tight enough to track my fitness stuff without swinging around my wrist.
4.0,I thought it was fitted amd its not. And it's baggy in the belly area
4.0,"This is a cute top that covers your front & back just enough to wear leggings and look classy -- well, except for the slit.  It was too high on the sides for my liking, and I was feeling trashy instead of sexy.  If you're sexy, you'll like it.  Also, beware that the fabric is a little cheap, and some of them have arm holes that are sewn differently on each side."
4.0,"We have purchased these for my daughter's Halloween costume, so we have not had a chance to really use them. They do run pretty large."
4.0,A little ackward to put on/adjust size but my 18 month old did not mind wearing them too much
4.0,"It's light weight.. And will do. I would say it ""ok""."
4.0,"Lighter weight is perfect for summer in GA.  No show through, no embarrassing sweat marks. Im 5'7"", 117 lbs, bought a small & they fit great.  Could easily fit a larger person."
4.0,Looks nice but holds on to hot yoga stank... as do most synthetic fibers. But...gah!<br />Holding it's shape better than the matching leggings I bought.
4.0,Super cute skirt. True to size. Good quality.
4.0,"Nice bandanas, I plan to use as a face covering. Vibrant colors!"
4.0,Its very elegant and beautiful the fabric is stretchy and comfortable
4.0,"It works beautifully and is quite durable. The thickness and length are a little overpowering for most women--a bit much for me too! The Quick Release mechanism is a little stiff, but will work on it to help it slide more easily. The color is perfect and matches the pics. I really don't like men/women's products and this one is definitely more suited for men."
4.0,These are really thin and for wire rim glasses ideally.
4.0,[[VIDEOID:d16f49d4aa52759ab3d0527f78ceebbc]] Super cute and durable
4.0,Wanted something a little casual to wear for a few parties this summer.  Very light weight but is a knit so will not show through.  Love the pattern. I ordered a medium and the elastic waist comes just below the bustline.  I am 5'7&#34; and 150 pounds.  Think I will wear this dress a lot.
4.0,"I felt that the pendant was way too big for the length of chain.  However, I do understand why it is because the pendant likes to turn! I really love the way it looks!  It is super cute!"
4.0,"They are super cute and extra light weight but will not protect you from any type of virus.  Would have been a better product with a heavier layer  closer to your face or a pocket for a filter.  May consider wearing over a protective mask or reconstructing to add another layer for better coverage!  Also, too thin to provide warmth but would be great for the warm or summer months!"
4.0,Love the fit and comfort. I was a little disappointed in the color. I anticipated that it would be darker yet I did decide to keep.
4.0,"No complaints about the fit of my medium sized shirt. It looks decent but I tend to wear a white T-shirt under it because the material isn't the softest. For being one of the cheaper Mavs shirts available, definitely worthwhile."
4.0,"A little warmer than I thought it would be... but no complaints. For those trying to make it match your multicam, this does well. More closer to a Crye design but close enough. Left and right patches aren't big enough for most unit patches but if that is not required, then you are good. Only thing I will do is add rank, name, and branch Velcro to make it more acceptable for standard units."
4.0,These are cute and stylish. Put together well. Just smooth out and go. Make a great gift or keep for yourself. I hope this has helped. Thank You
4.0,It is a nice face mask but even after adjusting still to big for child’s face.
4.0,For driving.
4.0,Fits a bit smaller than most large Nike sports bras.
4.0,A little on the thin side as far as the material but  good overall.
4.0,The items are Classy and Really Gorgeous in person but it's fragile. I don't think it can take ruffness.
4.0,Works great on any shoulder strap.
4.0,"The actual space inside the bag is kinda small and it can't hold a lot. It can hold a small wallet and a few small accessories but not much else. Other than that it's great, it's really cute and is well made."
4.0,this is a good faux gem and is thus a good looking faux opal
4.0,"Not the most durable, but for a couple of bucks it makes a nice accessory. I suspect the stainless is chrome plated, thus not quite so scratch resistant, but rhodium at this price isn't likely. Nice double foxtail links, seems sturdy enough."
4.0,I had order two different type of Yellow Lens Night Vision Driving Glasses. The Clip on were good. Since I have cataracts these rimless were better in bringing in more light on dark two-lane roads where the glare is more heavy due to the traffic on them. I live in a modernly small-medium town. These rimless clip were easy to use and can keep in the vehicle so I would not have to look for them.
4.0,"These PJs are comfortable, the material is light and breathable<br /> Perfect for Texas summer."
4.0,It fits pretty good. I'm 5'3&#34; and weigh 140lbs. It's a little bit frumpy and the long shirt kind of reminds me of the 80's long shirts. It's a really thin sweater material and I have a tank top under it. I bought the large. The medium would have been too tight.
4.0,Product serves the purpose but not happy with the price.
4.0,Do what the should and a good price.  I bought them not to go over glasses so they are a little large.  They do look somewhat cheap.
4.0,Very soft and comfortable. Runs true to size. Love the flair and swing.
4.0,Medium a little on the small side
4.0,"This is an attractive watch. The bezel turns easily and the weight is just right for me. Once set, you never have to touch it again, ever! It will always keep perfect time! I would like to offer a few words of advice. If you’re not good with tech, get someone to set this up for you or choose a different watch. Don’t ever lose the instructions or you will have a paper weight if it ever has to be reset. The instructions don’t tell you this but the first thing to do is fully charge the battery because the set up will drain it. The second thing to do is reset the hands so that they are perfectly aligned at the twelve o’clock position. If the second hand is one second ahead or behind it would drive me nuts since the watch is always perfect to the second! By aligning the hands before doing anything else this  annoyance will be prevented. The instructions tell you how to do it but they don’t tell you to do it before setting the watch. At 3 AM nightly the magic occurs and the watch sets itself. If you want to ”cheat” there is an iPhone app called Clock Wave that will broadcast the North American atomic clock radio signal from your phone. You can use this if you live in an area where the reception is not available or poor or if you don’t feel like waiting until 3AM to set your watch."
4.0,"This dress is beautifully made, didn't seem to have shedding out if the bag. It was a little scratchy. I am 5.7 about 145 muscle build. I am usually anywhere between small or medium. I didn't want it to be too tight so I ordered a medium. The dress has a little stretch to it. It is very sexy on fact too sexy for my liking. If you are going for a very sexy look with sparkle that is the dress for you"
4.0,They look nice but don't fit as well as my other Reebok capris.
4.0,"I think I may have liked this in a silvertone base a little better, the goldtone is a bright gold color. Nevertheless, it's a cute piece. Can't complain for the $"
4.0,Love these but the neutral biege is more like yellow.
4.0,"I love that the dress is soft and drapes flatteringly. I'm currently 30 weeks pregnant and it makes a great alternative maternity dress. However, I was pretty disappointed in the color of the green. I thought it would be more of a deep, vibrant green. Like the moss or jade green in the picture. It's more of an army/olive green. A bit faded compared to the picture. I also think it fits pretty large. I am 5'2 and 140 lbs (120 before pregnancy), and I could have done with a small. It's very long and also loose in the arms. With a nice belt or scarf, it still looks very cute, but a bit frumpy by itself. Overall, I'm pleased, and plan to keep it. I will probably try other colors as well. It's comfy and modest, which is what I wanted."
4.0,"This is so pretty. I'm surprised of the quality for the price. I do wish the chain was a few inches longer. The pendent is big and quite heavy. I put it on a 24 inch chain and it makes more sense.  It really is very nice. Thanks, Rosalie."
4.0,Keeps my toes from skidding on equipment.
4.0,"It's a pretty dress, but high waisted on me, and I wasn't expecting that.  I found a very wide belt to wear with it, but wish it didn't need that to bring it to my waist...and I'm not high waisted in my build.  I like it though.  Stylish."
4.0,The belt is fine.
4.0,"Cute for a photo. Didnt like that the top was so small, couldn't tie it around baby."
4.0,The material isn't as stiff as expected but it's perfects for a costume.
4.0,The bathing suit fits JUST like in the photo. High rise on the side.  I love the back.  However I've had a few surgeries and weight gain and then weight loss and I have no muscle where I was cut so the bathing suit does not sit right on that left side.  bummer for me because it was super cute.
4.0,"I have a pretty wide dome and sometimes sunglasses are tough to shop for. These were cheap, seem well made for the price and fit me pretty well. No complaints."
4.0,The fabric is soft. Love the blue flower on the left hip and right ankle.
4.0,Love my purple-framed sunglasses. Fit over my prescription glasses perfectly. Changing a lot of my accessories to purple in my old age. LOL!
4.0,Decent bag. Good zippers and tabs. Just a bit too narrow to be perfect. Deep enough though with good wide strap. Ok for the price.
4.0,"Cute, cheap, light plastic sunglasses. My son took some so he can wear them out and my girls use them for pretend play."
4.0,"This necklace is a choker length with with a nice pendant.  The chain is dainty and the pendant is removable. My teen daughter stole it and put it on as soon as I opened the package.  Despite all this, I don't know that it is worth the cost. The chain says it is gold plated sterling silver but only time will tell if the gold plating holds up."
4.0,it a key chain
4.0,Super warm but gigantic
4.0,I usually wear XL and the XL in this fit jus a tad bit big but no worries I can always get it taken in to fit a lil closer. So I guess anyone buying this should order a size under.
4.0,I loved it will definitely by again!
4.0,"This is a good bracelet, It doesn't feel cheap at all. My only disappointment with it is that i thought it was just a little bit wider.<br />Other then that, it's great."
4.0,The kids love it and it is what they say it is.
4.0,"Nice wallet. Small, comfy."
4.0,"My daughter looked super cute in this, it runs slightly big but that's ok she will be able to use it all year!"
4.0,Fits a little bigger than expected but it still looks nice
4.0,"I really like this hat, and received a lot of compliments on it when I wore it.  The seller, not so much.  They have sent me daily emails asking me to review the product.  Quite irritating!"
4.0,very pretty just the same color pattern but thier still bright and beautiful
4.0,"The girls loved these. They are small and they said it almost feels like it's not there. Which could be bad if it fell off but, worked flawless for them at Disney World. Only complaint they really had is if you sit for a period of time the Klips would dig into your waist."
4.0,I ordered a size larger. Got lots of compliments. The dress was comfortable
4.0,&#60;&#62;<br />&#62;&#60;
4.0,dress is beautiful but the torso is a little too long for me but im very petite. Will have it altered by a seamstress and make it work because i otherwise love it
4.0,"These little necklaces were a very sweet give to give my fiance. He found his to be very well made and did not turn his neck green (which was both of our fears). Although, the clasp could be a little on the chinsy side because the closure loop is very small and if pulled on hard enough would probably break. They are very brilliant in color as far as metal goes and the words are very well inscribed. The his and her is very cute with the his being a black heart with a gem stone and the hers being a gold one with a gem stone. I do think these are a very sweet gift for anyone of any age. I myself can't wear a lot of jewelry because of metal sensitivities but I had no problem at all with these. I didn't notice any type of discoloration happening after a few days of wearing which is nice. For the price I think it is a great value and a simple gift to give your loved one on any occasion.<br /><br />I did receive this product at a discount for my honest and unbiased review. I am rating it 4 stars based on quality and craftsmanship."
4.0,"These are nice, inexpensive polarized sunglasses. I love polarized sunglasses compared to the non-polarized. They also look pretty good. I would recommend."
4.0,"I looks great, however I do not care for the type of thread style they used. It is overall A wonderful design and worth getting."
4.0,I say that because the sequins will come off leaving little sparkles behind as you walk. I ordered an XL and yes my thighs touch so just figure the pants rubbed against each other causing the sequin to catch each other in my walk.  I also wore white leggings under the pants to keep the sequin pieces from sticking me. The jacket was a littler smaller fet felt like a large. all in all I got compliments all night.
4.0,look good and my wife loves them.
4.0,Gift for my father-in-law who is an Army vet.  He loved it.
4.0,I bought it to replace an older insert in my wallet where I could store photos. The Alpine Swiss insert is a bit larger than the original but it is serviceable and does the job. I am very satisfied with the product. A different brand that I tried was for name cards and was too small to accommodate photos.
4.0,"They are over the knee, and cuff well.  I use them with my slippers in the winter.  (Not with shoes or boots.). Though, super cozy, they are going to wear out quickly on the soles and toes.  (Size 8 shoes.)  But if they were more fortified, they wouldn't be extra cozy."
4.0,"True to size, snags very easily.. all around cute and comfortable"
4.0,"I love these lightweight, stretchy jackets. I own several in a couple colors, and I plan to buy more!<br /><br />They form fit so well you can barely tell they are there, but they also do a decent job creating a moderate insulating layer when you need it. I wear mine ice skating; they provide just enough warmth for moderate-intense figure skating practice, even in the chilly rink, but are perfectly non-bulky--I always hated wearing chunky jackets when trying to do the tricks involving more flexibility and maneuverability.<br /><br />My only complaint is that the colored jackets are NOT colorfast. My original red jackets have ruined white and light colored shirts--any amount of sweat or moisture will draw out dye--and I always have to launder them separately, with blacks, or with the exact same colors because they WILL color your clothes in the wash.<br /><br />Time to break out the dye fixatives!"
4.0,"I have worn this a lot already. Hair up or down. It shields your eyes from the sun. However, you can’t really wear sunglasses with it because they bump into the rim."
4.0,"Gorgeous kimono, but sizes run very small, if possible order up 1 to 2 sizes."
4.0,I loved the color and style especially at the bottom. Unfortunately it  not a fit for a petite woman.
4.0,Very comfy. Material is a little light/see through but it’s expected as it is white
4.0,This shirt is very comfortable but the straps are far apart and can fall or just be sometimes uncomfortable.
4.0,I LOVE IT BUT IT STOPPED RUNNING !
4.0,Crotch is weird.
4.0,"Haven't worn this yet, that's why the 4 star instead of 5 star review.  But this is such a soft, slinky, and shiny bracelet. It feels and looks so elegant and is so much more beautiful in person than in the photos.  It is very delicate but won't snag on clothing.  A very nice piece for wearing out for dinner or a special occasion."
4.0,Over all I love it because my jewelry is always getting lost cause I sleep on my face at night and I toss and turn and can never find the jewelry again so overall I’d say 4 out of 5 because some of the jewelry like the dice have broke
4.0,great quality. size is good. the one thing I didn't like is that the hat was squished and had to mold it back into a hat shape
4.0,"Bought these as a gift for a friend. Overall seemed nice, but I was a bit disappointed in the color/pattern of the leopard print one. It just seemed a little off/cheap. Hopefully they hold up okay. She liked them a lot, especially the little pom and tassels."
4.0,Super cute. I bought for Halloween costume for my 2 year olds. Fit them great.
4.0,"Nice cap, didn't have my size"
4.0,This was a gift for my boss for her 40th birthday. She absolutely loved it
4.0,The belt itself is quite comfortable and has a little 'give' from the elastic. The buckle is a little tricky and there are a few ways to fasten it. I found it to be a great looking informal piece - on the industrial EDC look - and if that's your red wagon you couldn't do better.
4.0,She just fall in love with them .  Have to buy bigger size
4.0,Great work out gear for running and or aerobics.<br />Fits true to size ...I bought a small and I'm<br />'5 3' 110lbs and it first perfectly.
4.0,It is very figure flattering and has held up great even after my kids through it in with the Jeans wash load more than once lol. It is worth it!
4.0,I liked the earrings very much except they are way too big for me.  If you like large earrings then you will love these.  They are not heavy and look more expensive than they are.
4.0,"Like the necklaces for the granddaughters, one was spelled wrong."
4.0,"Our grandson is very happy with this set, and it fits him well. A bit pricey as kids' swimwear goes, but we got it as a treat for him."
4.0,"I've always hated wearing belts but now in a profession that requires frequent movement in pants that don't necessarily fit my size exactly. I hated feeling the cold belt buckle against my skin. But that issue isn't a worry with this belt. Even more it keeps my pants sitting snug on my waist. My only problem is that the belt can curl on itself especially after going to the bathroom. For the belt to be effective, it needs to sit flat on your jeans and need to actually sit on your jeans to hold it in place. It isn't as effective if it's sitting in your skin above the jean material."
4.0,"Very good overall fit and compression but the waist isn’t as tight. I got the size small I’m 118 pounds, 5 ft tall.<br />My waist is size 30 inches, and the pants fit nicely but when I put my phone in the pocket and run or walk<br />The pant tend to fall Down at the waist. I will keep pants they are cute but don’t run in them with stuff in pockets<br />I will try ordering the extra small."
4.0,"I thought this would be bigger/roomier (is that even a word?) nice material, looks good, feels good. It's a dress to go out in public in- I thought it was more of a lounge dress by the picture. larger sizes would be nice. I'm 5'3&#34; and 180lbs. Nice dress will like it more when I loose a few pounds."
4.0,"It fits as expected. It looks nice, however, I found a small part of the lace torn on the back of the dress on the first use."
4.0,"Cool shirt, material is a bit thin though."
4.0,Runs smaller than described.  I gifted to a smaller young lady.
4.0,I like the band. It makes the watch look and feel heavier. I did have three links removed to fit my wrist and went to a clock shop to get it done. I would shower and sit in a hot tub with my watch on and don't know if the band will rust or lose  color.
4.0,"great deal for $11 and if you’re looking for a good bag to fill with money and leave under a park bench as ransom, I highly recommend this. 4 Stars."
4.0,Beautiful bag only thing I did not like you have no pockets to store anything.
4.0,"My three year old is obsessed with purple and dinosaurs. So I figured these would be perfect for her birthday gift. Unfortunately, they are a full two sizes too big. So they are going into storage for a while. They are really well constructed and super stuff and soft, though. The dinosaur is adorable but the random nonsense word bothers me."
4.0,"They fit and are pretty decent quality. But they're not white, they're an off white"
4.0,"Love them but not great in areas where there is a lot of noise,"
4.0,The colors are bright and very vibrant. It is a really cute hoodie. The fabric is a little thinner than expected so extra caution is needed to prevent pulls etc. My son loves it.
4.0,"These shorts fit as expected, nice high rise coverage. The pocket holds my iPhone11 well. Most leggings and bike shorts roll down for me when bending or stretching, these unfortunately are no different. Can't be too mad though because of the price. Overall a decent stretchy pair of shorts. Get the job done without breaking the bank. I am 5'5"" 185lbs, typically wear a L/XL in workout bottoms."
4.0,"Cute, comfy, different."
4.0,I like how the leather light color brings that elegant look to my watch. This is nice.
4.0,Decent product.  Comfortable and soft material.  Fits as expected
4.0,"My granddaughter who is currently serving in the Marine Corps proudly wears this necklace.  It is her favorite necklace.  Over time the color will come off, but she loves it as ALL silver as well!"
4.0,Perfect for a slip under sheer or short dresses which is what I bought it for :)
4.0,The shorts are light weight and fit good.
4.0,"I love the app, except a few limitations.  The watch band is causing me to break out.  I wish the watch was not so large."
4.0,Good thing I read the other reviews. I purposely bought a large but I'm normally a small. They do run very small.<br />I bought for my Halloween costume. So will only wear once.
4.0,"They all seem to be of decent quality especially for the price,my favorite are the blue ones so far but they keep falling out"
4.0,Love the soft gray fabric.
4.0,"Although I love this watch band, it doesn’t stay tight. I’m constantly tightening so it won’t fall off. Other than that… I love it!!!"
4.0,"I ordered a small because that's what everyone was saying. Little tighter in the stomach than expected. Definitely shows the love handles and stomach pooch more than liked. As a 5'2"" 120lb woman, the length and tightness around the chest (36AA) is fine.  There's enough room if I was bigger. The sleeves are a bit short though. I wouldn't say my arms are longer than average, but the sleeves aren't quite to the wrists. But I like how it feels and it seems comfortable to go running in."
4.0,I lost the bow that came with my pewter ballet flats and these go nicely with them as an alternative.
4.0,"My feet are large, I cannot use this with shoes on, however for the price, and likely seldom use (spills, contaminates) I don't expect to put much distance wear on them. So, off with the shoes, and it fit so should work during need."
4.0,"Great swimsuit cover up! Didn't hang off the shoulder like in the pic, but still cute. Would have been cuter if the  boat neck was bigger so it could look like the picture without looking like you're wearing a bed sheet. Good quality fabric and good price. I would recommend getting a size up. It's supposed to be baggy, so make it so."
4.0,Fit amazing ..I think it's gonna shrink with wash cause it's fruit by the loom
4.0,So far I've only worn it once but it attracted a lot of positive attention. I'm glad to wear it and it seems to keep good time.
4.0,"It’s really cute, the quality looks good, it just came a little scratched. I think it’s not authentic tough."
4.0,I liked these socks a lot at first. They more I wash and dry them the more rough they seem to get. Also the stichting at the top sometimes presses into my foot too much and starts to hurt
4.0,"Cute but I'd need to have it hemmed. It's a bit loose and baggy through the waist, so I sent it back. Might be better for taller women."
4.0,"Works like a charm, I folded it over and used it as 2 ply, breathable and not too hot"
4.0,Fits a little too small
4.0,Products are beautiful but are shipped in a Box with paper strips inside of a mesh bag because they are shipped in the mesh bag and not separately in the paper they knock against each other and the tiger's eye cracked it's not bad for what I paid for it and it didn't crack bad but it was a bad idea to ship it that way because when the stones knock against each other they crack otherwise very beautiful
4.0,"I attended a gala& since I dress in Vintage I wanted to wear black. This dress was very beautiful however, I had to get it altered badly due to it fitting like a large. I wear a small& it definitely didn’t fit like that lol Overall, I received a lot of compliments once I put my petticoat underneath& made it work. For more views Check my YouTube: It’s Time for Tea"
4.0,Cute dress! I felt like a cupcake with it on. But it was still cute with a jean jacket.
4.0,Love them style great inside could be more padded
4.0,Thanks bring it ...
4.0,"I ordered a Men's large and that size fit me perfectly (tall woman). I enjoy their flexibility and the etip fingers, however when the temp dips below 32, they only keep my icy fingers warm for 20 minutes. I may have to resort to snowmobilers gloves to walk the dog."
4.0,Super lightweight and comfortable. They are true to size and are perfect for outdoor activities.
4.0,"I really like this top, but I won’t be able to wear it to work as it’s a little see-through.  I received a size Large, which fits me quite well.  I am usually a Medium in tops.  These must run small.  I am 5’3” 120 lbs and 34 B.  The chest on this top is 36 inches around.  The shoulders width is 15 inches.  The hem falls to mid-thigh for me.  The material is very comfortable and stretchy.  The stars are PRINTED on the fabric.  Each star is about 2 inches.  It’s almost like they were screen-printed on after the shirt was made.  It is machine washable cold.  I gave it one fewer star for the thinness of the material.  I will probably wear it as a layering shirt under a jacket."
4.0,Super cute and fits my daughter great.
4.0,"I do like this... however, it is very hard to get into and out of. Also, it is like wearing spf 35... you will still get sun and can still get sunburnt! Be sure to put on sunscreen before putting the suit on. Other than that, I love it! Makes teaching swim lessons very comfortable for me and the kids!"
4.0,Really good first shoe for my newly mobile toddler.
4.0,Fantastic workmanship for the price! The stocking is a more petite size but perfect for my 2 year olds little stocking fillers!
4.0,I love the ring but I had thought from the images it would be more of a turquoise color and it turned out more blue. I still love it. I love unique rings and want to have ones that make a statement. This is one of them!
4.0,They arrived a couple of days ahead of schedule.  Husbands lenses fit perfectly and the color is great.  THANKS
4.0,"Overall this is an attractive strap. My only complaint is that it is a bit long and I have thin wrists so there is a substantial amount of overhang. That of course isn't their fault, though. I would recommend this strap to a friend with wrists that are wider than my own."
4.0,I ordered this but unfortunately I had to return this item it’s way to small for a normal adult face but could work for a kid. It is very sturdy and cool looking just wish it fit
4.0,I am very pleased with this purchase. The shoes are comfortable and look great. Don't forget the suede protector.  I got a little makeup from my hands on the shoe but nothing a ssuede brush could not take care of.  Spray the shoe for added protection.
4.0,"Glove is good. Looks good. Size runs small. XL is L, at best."
4.0,"Very thin and you really have to dress it up. Im 5""7 180. It wasn't as long as I it was be but long enough"
4.0,"I would give it 5 stars if it fit me better.  It is made of quality material, but it is tight and gives me a muffin top."
4.0,Brought them for my 6 1/2 year old son and he loves them.
4.0,"I expected a cotton shirt, which this isn't. Still cute."
4.0,I bought this outfit for a male doll for my grandson.  And they are cute and made good.  But very expensive for what you get.
4.0,it great to wear
4.0,"This is a very cute dress but you need to be at least 5'-9&#34; to have it not drag on the floor.  I had to cut and hem about 6&#34; off the bottom.  Otherwise, it is a great buy."
4.0,Very cute and affordable.  I only wish they had a bit more elasticity in them. They get loose while you wear them.
4.0,Just a little on the small side but very good quality. Soft and color fast.
4.0,Fit as expected it just wasn't flattering for me.
4.0,"Girlfriend is a professional fetish model 32C, 26, 36 (typically small, size 2 or less), fit, 120 pounds &#34;petite&#34;.  Fits perfect.  Front is a lace-up so that helps the universal fit.  Probably not going to fit a medium or larger body type but maybe check other reviews.<br /><br />Quality is along the lines of a Halloween costume rather than casual goth wear (works fine for photo shoots, though). Stock model photo is blurry so it's difficult to tell if the material is quality. Material is a cheaper slightly stretching fabric with a moderate sheen (65% cotton, 35% polyester).  Not PVC or latex but that's not a surprise at this price point.  Fit & finish was okay.  A loose thread here and there but nothing to impact the overall integrity.<br /><br />Design is asymmetrical meaning it has only one sleeve.  The right side terminates at the shoulder like a tank top or A-shirt."
4.0,Recommended by my doctor. Helps a lot with my thoracic pain.
4.0,"Runs small, order one size larger."
4.0,"Great for your money, I was tired of my kids pulling and breaking my chains. These last very well, don't get them wet."
4.0,"Very pretty and great fit, however made out of cheap material that felt like paper"
4.0,Super Cute suit.  Loved the fit.  Very flattering for plus size girls with big chests.  It's very cheeky so if you're looking for more coverage I wouldn't get this suit.  My only complaints are the white lining seems to stick out and you have to tuck it back in but its not that bad. The straps are detachable which is annoying because it definitely cant be worn without the straps.  It'll fall right off.  One of the straps kinda pop off randomly so I had to ask someone to snap it back in when I went to the lake.  Other than that its a really cute suit and I love it for right now!  Good quality and comfy!!
4.0,I love them but I only wore them once and one fell out and I lost it! There is a little clear plastic thing that comes with them that definitely needs to be put on while wearing!
4.0,I got a medium because I thought it would be more to asian sizing but this one is true to it's packaging.  I did do a size exchange and can't wait to wear this with my thigh high boots!
4.0,"I bought this packet of ten.  I have an odd sized neck.  If I buy a size larger, the shirt is too loose on the neck and if I buy a size smaller - chokes.  These little items are life savers.  The only down size is that the spring coil will wear out within a year.  So I need a pack of ten to get buy."
4.0,"I was a little scared about buying this after reading the reviews about it running small and, YES, it does run very small. I usually wear a size large in tops and according to the sizing chart, I should wear a 3XL, so that’s what I got and it fits perfectly. I got the charcoal color and it’s really pretty and the fabric is nice and soft. Can’t comment on the quality after washing yet since I just got it yesterday. If you’re going to get this, make sure you check the sizing chart with your measurements!"
4.0,I was skeptical ordering this shirt based on some kf the reviews. However the shirt is nice and lightweight! I ordered a small and runs a smidge bigger .
4.0,I absolutely love my daughter in this snowsuit! Keeps her warm.  I wish it had a snap to keep the top of the zipper closed. The zip keeps unzipping and exposes her neck and some of her chest.
4.0,"So this wasn’t the one I ordered. However, I ended up loving the watch. This one is more rose gold and has a white watch face. It looks very elegant."
4.0,Looks good. A nice buy for the $
4.0,"Works just fine. It's a lot better than the crummy expansion chrome squeeze clips. You must wear a real belt with it, but when you do this & then hook this rig to it, it adds the needed to support to carry heavy pocket weight easily (CCW-pistol ? ). I do kinda wish they'd incorporate a third support linq, for the back also. A 3 point, back connection, would make this a 5 STAR rig !!!"
4.0,"I bought the grey pair shown in the pictures here. I originally wanted the black but was sold out in a small, so I went for grey.(which had the small) I was sent a medium, which actually worked out! They fit me perfectly, so I don’t know how much I would go off the size chart. For reference, I am about 5’5, 120 lbs, about 27in waist. Size 3-5 in most jeans. These are thicker leggings, very comfortable! Great quality for the price!"
4.0,Very comfortable and they fit my hands very well with little to no binding.  Very happy with the purchase and will buy again if needed.
4.0,"I love this necklace, I would like for the chain to be a bit longer, but it is very pretty and dainty"
4.0,Very pretty lanyard and I am glad it has both ring and claw although I would prefer the ring only.  I also wish it was a little longer.
4.0,"Would buy again, would recommend to friends.<br /><br />ONLY downside to date - slips off of small nipples sometimes.<br />Otherwise? Gets the job done and fits nicely on more than just nipples if you know what I'm saying."
4.0,"Nice quality belt and buckle, but having to return it.  Ordered the proper size for my husband, but belt runs small and for a comfortable fit would need to go from a 38 to a 42."
4.0,"This is absolutely adorable and the material is lightweight , which is good for us in a Florida. I like that the sleeves are longer than most baby swimwear out there. For some reason the zipper gets stuck a lot...maybe because it’s a small metal zipper. That’s the reason for four stars instead of five."
4.0,These shower sandals are attractive and lightweight. The fit is true to size. The sizing chart online recommended that I order a size 12. I mistakenly ordered a size 11 and they fit perfectly. I am not usually that lucky. They do not absorb any water so they dry quickly. They are great for travel and for use in public showers. I took away one star because I feel they are a bit overpriced.
4.0,"Liked the style okay, they were just too long. Actual length was not as described in details."
4.0,"It's a little bit smaller than expected, but also I have problems picturing what 20 mm looks like. It's a bit smaller than a quarter. The stone is a lovely green, though."
4.0,"These leggings fit great. I'm 5'2 and weigh 105 if that helps in yours sizing questions. The faux leather panels are thin, I was thinking they were going to be a bit thicker. The sides feel more like a thin athletic wear type of material."
4.0,"I purchased pink and black. Both fabrics have a decent amount of stretch in them. I'm sending the pink back mostly because the black is more forgiving on my bumps and lumps. The black dress feels closer to a jersey material than the pink. I'm 5'7'' 170 34D size 12 in American eagle jeans, I ordered the large"
4.0,Spandex polyester and nylon
4.0,"Just need to tone up a bit personally but I like it otherwise. Only complaint is that the button detail will need to be secured better, very loose. But for the price I can tighten those threads myself."
4.0,Good quality and affordable price. Even after a few washes it still looks great and hasn't become fuzzy or faded. Fit as expected.  I would buy again.
4.0,"Great Product, good as advertised. Would purchase again"
4.0,Very nice and comfortable. Fits exactly right.
4.0,Fine jeans. Material is a little stretchy which I like.  A bit baggy in the butt. Maybe it will shrink a little when washed.
4.0,"I originally gave this item 5 stars, but have since changed it to 4 stars after ordering/receiving another size belt and seeing how inconsistent the items are between sizes.<br />**********************************************************************************************************************<br />I have been wearing this belt probably 2-3x a week for almost six months and it's wonderful! The grommets are just fine, the belt hasn't come apart in any places, and the &quot;missing holes&quot; that others complain about don't look bad at all--in fact, I never even noticed it (on my belt it's about 3&quot; or barely three sets of grommet holes which would normally be covered up with the overhang--see photo). That said, it is starting to get slightly worn where I usually place the buckle, but that's to be expected with pretty much any belt.<br /><br />And I'd say that it runs big. I originally ordered the XL when I had about a 42&quot; waist and it was big enough to wear 80's style. Now that I've lost weight and have a 38&quot; waist, I have about 8&quot; overhang and it's annoying so I'm back to order a smaller size (I could just cut this one down but for the price I'll just order a smaller one) so I'll be ordering a Medium which I hope fits correctly.<br /><br />The XL is 50&quot; long from tip of silver buckle to the end of the leather.<br /><br />EDITED 3/19/16 TO ADD: I received the Medium belt and it was way too small. The M is 40&quot; long from the tip of the silver buckle to the end of the leather. So, size 14 jeans, 190#, needs a size Large.<br /><br />EDITED 3/24/16 TO ADD: I received the Large belt and it's actually just about right. It is 45.5&quot; long from the tip of the silver buckle to the end of the leather and once buckled, there's about 3-4&quot; of overhang. HOWEVER, the holes are spaced ever-so-slightly differently than the XL belt! I thought I was imagining it at first BECAUSE WHY WOULD THEY BE DIFFERENT? But when I placed the belts next to each other it became obvious (see photo). For every nine sets of holes in the XL belt, the L belt only has eight. That might not seem like that big of a deal, but it was enough for me to notice when I tried to buckle the belt for the first time. Also, as you can see in another picture, the L belt has MUCH more &quot;empty&quot; space (space without holes) on the belt than the XL did. I could barely notice it on the XL belt when I was wearing it, but it's much more noticeable on the L belt.<br /><br />All that said, it's still a great belt for the price. But because of the inconsistencies I've lowered rating to four stars."
4.0,I'm a 70 yr old female and needed a new zip up hoodie to replace one I've had for 15 years that was falling apart.  This hoodie is light in weight.  I ordered a size Large in the Oxford color (light gray).  The quality is good for the price.  I needed something decent in cooler weather when a winter coat is too much. I just received the hoodie today so I haven't worn it outside yet but I've tried it on and I like it!  The pockets are a nice depth and my cell phone fits with no danger of falling out.
4.0,"Llevo menos de un mes con el, poco tiempo para dar una valoración completa del reloj, pero puedo decir que este reloj tiene mucha calidad y belleza, todas las funciones expuestas por el fabricante funcionan a la perfección, me hubiera gustado que el broche fuera de un material de más calidad, pero funciona perfectamente así, además que por el precio estoy completamente satisfecho, en caso de presentarse algo malo con el reloj lo reportarle para ustedes"
4.0,"this dress is beautiful! fit just as expected and the quality was amazing, especially for the price! the only thing i would say is wrong with this dress, is that the fabric snags somewhat easily."
4.0,"I purchased these clear stadium bags for a summer concert, so have not used them yet. They are as advertised and the larger bag with strap has plenty room for summer jackets and some bottles of water. The smaller bag is perfect for a phone, or camera and other necessities. I am pleased with the purchase."
4.0,I ordered a size up and it was a lot smaller than I expected.
4.0,"I would say size up a size. I decided to get a size 6. Everything fits except the arm area. Just a tad tight. Other than that, great quality! Definitely would recommend if you wanting a good basic jacket for cool weather."
4.0,It is a good pin for the money.
4.0,These socks are comfortable and seem to stay up well.  They are a thinner material  so I'm able to wear them with shoes in the warmer months without feeling like they're too heavy.  I would purchase these socks again.
4.0,Size is good. Shippedfast
4.0,It’s cute but make sure you use the sizing chart. I thought it would be too big but it actually was a bit too small.
4.0,"Quality and price are great, I love it and I recommend it."
4.0,Love this hat only thing is that it came crushed and still has some dents in it
4.0,stylish and attention getting
4.0,"The hat looks and fits well! I have no issues with it so far, And the knitting looks as if it will last for awhile."
4.0,I got the first cork wallet in Spain several years ago -- it wore like iron!  This new one promises to do the same.
4.0,I love the style and color.
4.0,"I bought this handbag for a friend for her bday. It really is a beautiful bag. She hadn't purchased a new purse in years. It was time. So I scoured the internet for a shoulder bag, black, leather, with some elements of hardware (studs). The bag came and it was so gorgeous! It looked wonderful on her shoulder, too. The only issue was (and this is entirely a personal choice), she decided she might have trouble reaching in to her purse, say, in her car, due to the fold/flap construction at the top of the bag. She loved the chain strap that comes with the purse as an option (the chain strap is removable). It gives it that added hardware. But to use that strap, you have to tuck the leather strap into the bag - the leather strap is not removable. This  presents a problem when you reach into your purse to get something. You have to dig past the leather strap, which isn't long enough to sit at the bottom of the bag. It kind of rests above your items. I can see how that would become very irritating. Ultimately, as gorgeous as the bag is and how perfect it looked on her shoulder, we chose another Michael Kors bag with a more traditional zip-top and strap. But please note, if what I have described wouldn't bother you, this bag is GORGEOUS! Really stylish and fashionable."
4.0,Ithink the dress is Precious. One drawback however- the embroidery in front has a rough backing that is Not trimmed and is glued to the dress so Icannot trim it. It covers the entire front inside of the dress. Maybe in the future the manufacturer could trim it or use a softer backing.
4.0,These offer some relief when I use them at home. I have a different pair at work which seems to block a bit more of the light. These are ok for use at home since I do not spend as much time on computers or electronic devices. The two pairs made it easy to share with my daughter.
4.0,Light weight. Easily packed for hikes. Looks good.
4.0,The green is way more like kelly green than hunter green. I had to use black dye to get it to the color I wanted. But after that I loved it.
4.0,These are really cute small earrings. They are very cute when worn together and the small hoops are the perfect size for a cartilage piercing. They do bend really easily so best if you leave them in for awhile instead of removing them nightly.
4.0,Really cute and light but run some what big.
4.0,"A diamond in one of the balls came out. Other than this, I love all of them."
4.0,I like the look if not the fabric.
4.0,Its cute but a little smaller than shown
4.0,"My wife said the dress fit well, although she knew enough to order it a size larger than normal. It does run small. It had serious creases out of the package, so plan on washing it first to get those out. She said it was comfortable to wear but it didn't breathe - it looks like it would be wearable as a ""normal"" dress instead of just a costume, but the fabric doesn't agree."
4.0,Upon further inspection with watch magnifying/led glasses:watch is worn around day set dial and month set dial.I like the watch just didnt expect for it being new to have any wear.
4.0,"This dress is very pretty and fits great- I ordered wine color and it is very red - was hoping for a darker color. I wear size 14, 5ft7in tall 195lbs, 38D, bought xl it fits perfect- I am returning it for the black color, wine was just to bright red, would have preferred a dark burgundy."
4.0,I looked at reviews and decided to order a size smaller and I’m glad I did! I normally wear a Large but ordered a Medium in black. It fits nicely and not snug. The material is stretchy but slightly see through depending on your undergarments. I’m short and it fell right at the top of my knee.
4.0,so far so good. liked the color options and my daughter is not complaining. she likes them
4.0,"The dress looked adorable on the model, but the shoulders and sleeves are much bigger in person than they look in photos. The ruffle details were also more subdued in photos. It’s also very low cut!<br />I didn’t end up wearing it for the event I bought it for, but it could work paired with a jacket over it.<br />For the price, not a bad deal. The quality is decent for the price."
4.0,It's super think and durable!
4.0,"I wear a size 11 US shoe I normally purchase Skechers weather I buy slip ons or lace up the Skechers always fit very good!<br />The only problem with this pair of shoes is they are loose around the ankles, but other than that they fit fine!<br />That is the only reason I gave them 4 stars."
4.0,Gorgeous! Lasted a while before the dangle detached - a common occurrence with dangle navel rings.
4.0,Lovely and handy.  Just as described. Thank you!
4.0,Exactly as pictured and not see through.
4.0,Thin material. But super cute.
4.0,I bought this wallet for my husband before we went on vacation.  The RFID blocking gave us a little sense of security and the wallet is very nice.
4.0,Used this costume to bartend 2 Halloween parties. Fit perfectly- true to size. The accessories were perfect for it as well. The head scarf has wire in it so it stay in place and you can make it fit how you want. Loved it.<br />I ordered separate 50s shoes with pink to go with it
4.0,"First, I think they’re loosing business by advertising them as being for Women and not including Men too because, I’ve seen men wear similar styles and I don’t see these as particularly feminine. Just a thought. Anyway, they do the job well, look decent and even come with a nice Soft-Cover Case and a cool little blue colored Light to show how they really do block Blue Light.<br />  I actually got them in the Hopes of accomplishing 2 things because, I saw they have a yellowish tint and wanted them to help with Night Driving. They aren’t exactly what I wanted but, they are still pretty nice and I would recommend them. Enjoy!😁"
4.0,"I purchased two of these polos to wear while golfing (I ordered one in black/white and one in purple/white). I ordered an XL, but found it somewhat small compared to a typical women's XL. The purple is true to color. The material is very lightweight and breathable, and remains comfortable in 100 degree heat! I especially like it because it stays comfortable and dry when faced with sweat, and is great to wear when you want to be able to move freely and comfortably but want to look somewhat more professional. You could easily take it to an embroidery shop and have it personalized with a name, team or company logo, making this a great purchase for sports organizations, business, charities...the possibilities are endless!<br /><br />Overall, this is a great purchase if you are looking for a quality sportswear moisture wicking polo at an affordable price!"
4.0,Nice dress but the sizes run small. I had to return for one size larger to wear comfortably.
4.0,Sizes run a little big but good product
4.0,"It's very stylish I get lots of compliment, looks very expensive for price."
4.0,The overalls were really nice. They did run a little small even with me getting a larger size tahn I normally wear. Overall very nice and good quality.
4.0,It’s a nice shirt. But the color of the print is nowhere near as bright as shown in the pictures.
4.0,"These shoes are very cute in person.  My daughter just turned 12 mon and I think the shoes run a little big.  Her feet turn inward so the shoes keep bumping together at the toes.  I also expected the shoes to be a little firmer but they are made of very soft leather so although comfortable, not very sturdy for one learning to walk.  Once she begins to walk, I will allow her to wear them but for now, the are very cute shoes on her dresser.  I do plan on buying more umi shoes in the future."
4.0,"These are sleek, classy earrings that will fit to almost every woman's wardrobe. The only negative thing I've noticed is that the posts feel really thick when I'm putting them in my ears. Also, I have small ears and my lobes aren't fleshy, so sometimes it takes an adjustment to get these earrings to stay in place. Otherwise, I like them and wear them with a variety of outfits."
4.0,"It’s cute but small so you cannot put many things in it, and not a high-quality material but overall I think it is good for coins"
4.0,"As someone who has a small bust the top didn’t fit me since I’m normally a XS, but I decided to order a S since it was the only option that was available to me.<br /><br />As long as you can get a seamstress to help you tailor your swimsuit I see no problem with it."
4.0,The plating comes off fast
4.0,"More brown than olive, way cute, I hope they hold up"
4.0,This is a comfortable way of showing ones patriotism.
4.0,"they were fine, a little bigger than expected but I have no complaints"

This does not alter my opinion in anyways."
4.0,Super cute - opening at the topics kind of small so no laptop or notebooks but other than that very stylish and lots of room
4.0,"Because this is a natural stone I understand the color varies but the one I have is probably 60-66 percent uniform in color and definitely not comparable in color intensity as the stone pictured. My stone is still pretty but not in the same way. In person, I would have chosen something with a lot more contrast. Overall I love the size, shape and design. It hangs  perfectly on a 15 inch chain I already had."
4.0,I love the weight of them and the color . It has more green then I thought but still love them.
4.0,"I got this for my daughter to wear at the surprise party we threw for her father's birthday and it was perfect. The design is super cute and ideal for a party.  I love the cute bubble/polka dot pattern; super fun and colorful.<br /><br />Considering the price, I was impressed with its quality.<br />The material is so soft and is a silk-like material.<br />The dress appears comfortable and it fits true to size.<br /><br />I'd recommend it because It is one of my daughter's favorite dresses.<br />I will warn, this isn't a dress to play outdoors in.<br />My daughter ripped the material, but lucky for us it was easy to stitch."
4.0,"These items are very cute. The only issue I have is that the faux fur poms aren’t very fluffy. I have attempted to fluff them, but they kind of gather strangely. Overall, I’m happy with it (I don’t wear real fur) and don’t mind the look too much, but if you are looking for something that mimics real fur, this is not it."
4.0,The yoga running pants are not only  stylish but very comfotable as well. Unlike some yoga pants that I have purchased the waist of these stay in place and do not roll down. Material is of good quality. I recieved this product at a discount.
4.0,[[VIDEOID:e5675ff22be74cabdb1e7bc4d9113639]]
4.0,"Really like the jacket, but it's been so warm here in Colorado, I haven't been able to wear it!<br />Love the color.  It does run a bit small, as do all Carhartts, but the Full Swing helps movement when doing chores."
4.0,"I returned.  Looked too matronly on my small frame.  Well made, just not for me."
4.0,Its long but as expected for a modest longer type of day dress. Its comfortable and when worn with a belt and over jacket an outfit can be made!
4.0,I love the earrings.  I was trying to match a necklace with the abolone but that didn’t work out. No matter...
4.0,Great keychain!  Exactly what I wanted.
4.0,"Fits just right. No room to grow, however."
4.0,"5'7&#34; 128lb 32B<br />I bought a M and it fits well! If my legs were any bigger, it would be difficult to pull up."
4.0,"The fabric is soft, the shorts could be considered longs, because these bad boys are about two inches below the knee. And I'm a fan, there are tie strings at the bottom of each thigh so if you want to sneak snacks into the movie theater these shorts are your jam, the length adds to that function.<br /><br />Would be a 5 star rating but the strings are annoying"
4.0,:gggghjk uhh cccfgh
4.0,"Really cute. Listed as 12-18 months. Our medium-large 13 month old is a good fit. The legs are super short, so not a good choice for actual cold weather wear without a substantial additional base layer."
4.0,Good novelty glasses. Arrived in perfect condition. No complaints.
4.0,They were a little too long.
4.0,Nice clear aviator's. The frame fit is a little small but doable.
4.0,Good glasses. A little tricky trying to figure out the technique on switching out the lens
4.0,"I liked it,,, very pretty"
4.0,Great hat for the price.  Sizes run large.  I had to reorder a smaller size.  Return was no problem.  Good material and looks good.
4.0,Very nice set I really like it. The bracelet could've been a little more stretchier but it fits
4.0,I like this ring especially how the inner piece can spin. The only negative thing about this ring is that the print on it is very small.
4.0,I wish these heels were just a little bit higher. Great work shoe.
4.0,"I purchased the JM three pack and the delivery was fast however, the 2 pack that they also offer was delivered instead of what I paid for.  I contacted Amazon quickly they sent out the correct order. While I am happy I did not have to pay for return shipping I am not pleased that I have to add to my day to find a local Kohl’s department store to return the incorrect package. I do think that Amazons partnership with Kohl’s is a smart one however. I am  Pleased with the JM Glasses optically and with their construction, style and fashion options.  I only smog complaint is that  they are not Very comfortable on the nose after a extended period of time. I think it’s a very good value for a three pack of readers for under $12. So my expectations cannot be to the standard of expensive designer Readers. I have an average sized nose but Maybe if your nose is a bit smaller,  the bridge Pressure will not be an issue. I actually was looking for joy Mangano readers because I have them and needed to buy more to place in all the locations that I may have need for glasses so I thought JM was a sub name of her company. It is not. Nevertheless I will restate that the service the value and the quality are in line with what you receive. I recommend."
4.0,I ordered per other reviews and it was HUGE. Thankfully it is Prime so I can easily return.
4.0,"I purchased these for my husband, who saw these on the Amazon website; he had been requesting socks with a non-slip grip. He stated that though he likes many of the ones in retail stores, they don't provide three key factors: non-slip, sturdy material, and a reasonable price. So, apparently, these met his criteria. He does like them and stated that they fit as he expected. I only gave them four stars because he then said: &#34;They are all right.&#34; Please know that since he is quite picky, these could, in fact, be worth five stars, but since I have not tried them on and walked around in them, I am not sure. At the end of the day, he likes them and is not interested in returning them. That works for me."
4.0,Cute. I like the fit and the feel of it.
4.0,Towel a little thinner than I imagined but still good quality.
4.0,Witch charm witchy look into black.
4.0,Great material. We love it.
4.0,"the polarized lenses definitely work to cut the glare caused by my dashboard when driving, it's like night and day.  I only gave it 4 stars because the frames seem a little inexpensive, but hey, they are under $20 so what do you expect?  I wear them all the time and would definitely buy them again if necessary."
4.0,"These were too small. If you don’t size up you’ll have to use the hair dryer and thick sock fix. They are very cute, though."
4.0,"Love me Air Max's! They are very comfortable, I'm a size 6 in women's and got a size 4.5"
4.0,"Replacing a pair I  have worn out after years of service.  Like those, these are flat front and seem well made. Waist and inseam are the same but the legs are not as tapered."
4.0,I absolutely love this jumpsuit!  Only down fall is there are not pockets OR adjustable straps as described.
4.0,Looks great but made poorly.<br />The metal nose band is not centered at all and trying to get the filters in is frustrating.
4.0,So far it work pretty well. The credit card holder still needs some work but it’s a decent slim wallet.
4.0,It's a great band and it is easy to apply. Just a little to snug and can be too hot around wrist.
4.0,Nice quality. A little bigger than I wanted. But was shorted 7 in count.
4.0,"The bag is small, one pocket can hold my iPhone 6s but that's about it. For me, it's not an everyday bag but definitely a bag when I don't have much to hold. Really cute."
4.0,Fits nice. I ordered a size bigger because other reviews stated that it ran small. Glad I did. I am 5'1 and weigh 165. I ordered an extra large.
4.0,This anklet is pretty and thank goodness it fits my semi-large ankle. LOL.
4.0,The only reason I put fits as expected was because I ordered 2 sizes bigger and thank God I did if not it would have been too too small. Looks very elegant!
4.0,They fit great and I love the pockets. My only complaint is that the tummy control was super light.
4.0,Cute outfit but it runs big I'm 5'4 145 and a small was a little loose and it's definitely midi length lol idk what the other reviewers are talking about
4.0,"I've bought one a while ago in xl..this time,I ordered a large... I got charged,but it never arrived... it's very nice,I was looking forward to it,because the other one was to big for me ... I feel so disappointed and cheated😔"
4.0,Would’ve given the hoodie five stars? Except the print on the material at the elastic wristbands is not as thick as the rest of the hoodie.  If you stretch the wristband the pattern becomes white don’t know if it was a problem with this particular hoodie or that’s the problem with all the elastic wrist bands on Joe’s Hoodies .  Other than that a great hoodie. I guess since it’s camouflage just disappointing that the elastic wristbands are turning white in color.
4.0,"It's cute and we're keeping it, but my daughter won't be able to wear it for very long before we have to size up to a bigger leotard. The sizing is a bit off, for sure."
4.0,These are lovely.  If they were for one person i would have bought the multi-colored pack.
4.0,Good for price. Quality is not the best but it is still cute. Runs small.
4.0,Center zip compartment is loose and came upside down.  Fixed it.  Top zipper is hard to close and at the ends was hard to close all the way.
4.0,"Have just received my (2) orders. I specified 10.5 (44) and 10 (43), and the 44 - usual for me - fit nicely. Nice looking sandals, comfortable, and they appear well made indeed; no reason to think that they'd not hold up. Holding back a star as only time will tell."
4.0,"It will definitely keep you warm and the material is great. I guess my only issues is how restrictive I feel once I have it on. I was aware its' a pullover ""hoodie blanket"" when I purchased it, but once I had it on, going all the way down to my calves, I found it a bit too constrictive. That may not be an issue for some, but for me, I wish it had a zipper in front."
4.0,Excellent quality and works perfect with my Coolaroo sun shades.  Bought to all me to have it anchored at different heights.  Expensive for what you get but it’s functional and looks like original parts.  Wish you could just buy the holders because I don’t need more bungee pieces.
4.0,Birthday gift for my husband as a second watch. Really likes it!
4.0,"One leg was longer, so I had to tailor one side, but overall was what I wanted and expected"
4.0,"This is a unique choice, and it's just ""alright"" for me, not the ""wow"" factor I was envisioning.<br />Also, the material was not exactly what I expected, more Lycra then cloth. The fit is fine, true to size."
4.0,Very happy with this robe. It’s a little thinner than I expected but it’s very comfortable and soft. Some reviews mentioned the sleeves were short. The sleeves were actually perfect for me!
4.0,"The lining does not come all the way down the dress as in the picture, but overall nice dress for the price. I will be honest that the quality of the dress was a tad bit lacking but it got the job done for the night.  Will post pictures later :)"
4.0,"I have no idea who Sophia is because I ordered a different name.  But I will review the name/necklace that I received.<br /><br />This necklace is best suited for a teen, or a woman who is okay with wearing plated jewelry.  The18k gold plate is attractive with a smooth, even finish and a nice shine, but the weight and feel will ensure that the wearer will not mistake it for real gold. The name “Sophia” is exactly one inch long, and hangs on a chain that has a lobster clasp and a 2” section of larger links at the end, so that you can extend the length of the necklace.  That extra length is convenient for wearing it on top of a jewel-neck blouse.  The necklace comes on a card that says “I heard the most beautiful word today, It was your name.”  It comes in a gift box that is black velvet inside and plain brown outside.  I think it would look more elegant removed from the card and instead displayed on the black velvet in the box.<br /><br />I do recommend this necklace.  The name is a nice size, and the necklace overall is pretty.<br /><br />If my review was helpful, please let Amazon know by clicking “helpful”.  Thanks.<br /><br />P.S.  The product description cautions me to “pay attention”.  It says that previous bad reviews resulted from a system error that shipped names other than the one ordered and that they “guarantee that the name of your order from this listing will be 100% correct.”  I did pay attention.  The statement is absolutely incorrect given that I received the wrong name.  I did not let that statement impact my review."
4.0,Was not up to the brand's quality. Could be a counterfeit.
4.0,"They look good for such an amazing price for the whole set.<br />I gave it 4/5 stars because I needed to make one more hole to fit me and I'm not interested in the leopard one.<br />Overall, worth buying."
4.0,"My lenses are perfect, no scratches! These are light and very comfortable, which I like. They fit my small framed face wonderfully. No slipping when I lean over. Perfect for sunny days. I like they come with a small bag for protecting them."
4.0,"I got this as a gift for my friend and it looks great!!! The quality is not the best though. If you accidentally scratch it with your nail, or something like that it was leave a dent"
4.0,"boyfriend bought there for me, since it gets pretty slippery when i do yoga...purchased the smaller size version for me (I am actually 38-39shoe size), but they fit better than if bigger...like it!"
4.0,Perfect for a little girl. Chain a bit short but if you're ordering for a child (which I did for my 10yr. old) then it's the right length.
4.0,Purchased for traveling. Love the size and the fact I can use as wristlet or cross body. Fit in my laptop bag so I don't have to carry two bags. Material is soft which was a concern. Fits all my &#34;to go&#34; necessities including my phone. Chose the red and I'm not disappointed!  Came in a cute box too.
4.0,"Having read the reviews, I ordered a size up - M instead of my usual S.  Definitely glad I did, but since sizing was made clear by others, it was exactly what I wanted/expected."
4.0,I needed cheap sports bras and these were perfect. They come with padding but you can take them out. It was apt more comfortable without them. They come out just like they would in a bathing suit. I’m a 38C and ordered a large. Fit as expected.
4.0,They’re cheap and the lenses are super dark. They’re great for ocular migraine sufferers. I wore them every day for 3 months and one of the metal arms just snapped in half. I just ordered 2 more pairs.
4.0,"Gave it 4 stars because of the waist was so tight, but the rest was very comfortable and warm"
4.0,These were a gift and they were well received.  I gave them to a magician friend and he really liked them.
4.0,I thought it would be shiny because it literally says it would in the tittle but it’s okay I still like it and it’s really warm and fits me well
4.0,Fit perfect and there super clear just like a new pair of real oakleys they are a little thinner than the originals but fit perfect
4.0,"Very good quality. Since I needed a fill-in larger size while recovering from a broken wrist, it looks as good as the original sterling silver one."
4.0,"I ordered these 2x this year.  Ordered a set of 40 in Jan13 and 10 pgs with 4 lights to a pkg, these were perfect, kids/adults loved them.  Then I ordered another 40 of them in Oct13 and this time they were all dumped in a bag and were terrible.  The rubber band was very cheap and stretched out quickly, the lights didn't work until you taped the battery end closed tight.  Otherwise they would just flicker from the batteries not being in tight contact or not turn on at all. One they were taped there was only 1 light that didn't work."
4.0,"I am 5'11 and usually wear a large. It fits perfectly! This shirt is super cute and exactly what I expected. The only odd thing about the shirt is the sides, but its hardly noticeable."
4.0,my husband likes it
4.0,They fit a little tight and honestly can't tell any difference from less expensive glove liners.
4.0,"These run a little large, I normally wear a 2X but I had to send these back because they were too big everywhere.  I’m not sure if they would have shrunk I couldn’t take that chance because then I couldn’t send them back. Seems like nice thick quality pants though. Im 5’4’ @ 230 lbs and am pear shaped. Hopefully this will help you out."
4.0,Exactly as expected for the price. Inexpensive costume jewelry made decently.
4.0,Slightly cheap material but super pretty!
4.0,"I love this and received a lot of compliments when I wore it. I thought it was cotton, but it is more of a soft shiny type material.  I still loved it."
4.0,Super cute for the money
4.0,Bought this with a set of princess cut earrings for my niece's 11th birthday.  She likes it a lot and will be wearing it at her upcoming recital.
4.0,I did enjoy the look of this band but unfortunately it pulled the hair on my arm and it was uncomfortable when that would happen. Other than that I enjoyed this and the way it looked.
4.0,"such a cute piece to my bunny costume, only thing is its a little big; and the material is kinda cheap."
4.0,"I love the material, color, and design of the shorts! Based on other reviews/feedback, I chose the medium and even after washing, would have been better with a size small. I’m 5’3 and 133lbs."
4.0,Excellent fit!  It is versatile and looks nice with jeans as well as dress slacks!  Received lots of compliments!!
4.0,Pretty and stylish. It’s a perfect “substitute” wedding ring when I don’t want to wear my more valuable piece.
4.0,"I get compliments on these all the time. Only reason it’s not 5/5 is that they don’t rest on my forehead (wide set, I guess) but it’s not that much of an inconvenience"
4.0,"This a better mouse trap but don't do as I did.  When I purchased the belt, I selected a size that would accommodate my 38"" waist size, and when I received the belt I cut it for my 38"" waist size. The belt fits but the pawl that captures and fastens the belt to the buckle engages at the very last notch on the belt. That point on the belt is the 38"" dimension I cut it to. If my girth increases to 39 or 40"" during the next year or so i'll be bug eyed when I cinch it up. So, no matter your waist size, cut it an inch or so longer.<br />The belt works well, but some of my every day trousers have a bulky waist band with a large button. Because the back side of the buckle is open, the button can be pressed against the back side of the belt (where the notches are) and released from the pawl that captures the belt. I've over come this issue by shifting the fastened belt buckle away from the button location.<br />Thus far my trousers remain at a sociably acceptable configuration for any public appearance and I'll likely purchase another."
4.0,Nice jacket fit really good.
4.0,Ordered twice now. I will order again. Fast shipping.
4.0,I should have ordered next size up.  still stretch to fit though.
4.0,Very nice.  Size is just right.
4.0,Nice light fabric looks just like pic
4.0,"I own 2 pair of these leggings and love the way they look and fit. One minor issue though... look very closely to the models wearing these, the crotch area to be specific. The patch area in the crotch area is WAY to long! I noticed it when I bought them but just thought the models didn’t pull them all the way up/on properly. This is NOT the case. So just know the patch in the cart he area goes down about 1 1/2” down onto the inside of your thighs. You COULD try forcing that up to where it isn’t sitting on your thighs but then you will have bunched up material in the creases where your leg bends at the hip.<br /><br />I thought... no one will even notice that the crotch area is sitting on my legs... lol I was wrong. I went to the mall in these and noticed multiple peoples eyes going to that region, and no I didn’t have cameltoe either. Final one lady who worked at AE kept looking in that area and I just point blanked ask her what she was looking at... she pointed out the crotch area sitting on my inner thigh. LOL she thought maybe I didn’t realize it."
4.0,"It looks just like the picture, and it fits perfectly. I wear a 36D and the Medium size fitted just fine, maybe a little big on the sides, but the small wouldn't have fit me definitely. Totally worth it, got complimented about it the whole night I wore it!"
4.0,Personal me gustó
4.0,"They are nice, but definitely big for kids"
4.0,"Cute shirt, good quality, good purchase."
4.0,"Love fairy tail. Necklaces are cute, I had to buy better chains but overall would buy again."
4.0,Pretty dress but be aware that the fabric is heavy and hot.
4.0,"Love the comfort. But my son normally wears a size 2 shoe and a 3/4 in these was too SMALL. We had to return them and size up to a 5/6!!<br />Now that we have the right size, my son loves them.<br />I'd say if you are a size 1, the 3/4 will be okay. But if you're a size 2, you're best bet is to order a 5/6."
4.0,Just got my blouse. Looks great. After reading previous comments ordered Medium rather than Large and fit was perfect.
4.0,It's more reddish brown than it is black but it's cute and comfy
4.0,Very comfortable....the material was a bit thin...we'll see how it holds up after several washings.  I would hand wash in Woollite and air dry.
4.0,"I had to trim the flat top off, too long and was stabbing the inside of my nose. Once I trimmed it, it was comforteable and did the job of concealing my nostril piercings. I have both sides of my nostril pierced and with these in, and makeup on, can't tell I have my nose pierced!<br /><br />Have to be careful when washing and drying face. Towels will snag the retainer and you'll never find it. I've lost more than I care to admit from drying my face with a towel."
4.0,"Great design and feel, I suggest you order one size up and have it tailored if necessary. Great buy though, I dont regret the purchase."
4.0,"Nothing fancy. My daughter ripped one pair after an hour and has worn the other through 6 dance classes, so....not sure what that says about the quality."
4.0,"well made, little smaller than expected"
4.0,Very pretty. Love.
4.0,"Love them. I did not pay attention to the size though, so it was a bit of trouble getting it into my small ear piercing. Good material that has lasted through many showers."
4.0,"The shirt is fantastic and the designs are perfect for standing out. This would be the perfect summer shirt since it's not too heavily materialized but the shirt is still not really breathable, and the sleeves are super short &amp; cut into the arm a little bit. Overall I love the shirt and have purchased two more in different colors!"
4.0,"Very cute Blouse. The color is a beautiful, light blue; the quality is good. This fits loosely, which adds to the look. You can dress this up/down. I wore this with jeans...to a reception and received lots of compliments.<br /><br />This top is sheer and requires an undershirt - I did not expect that, so I wanted to mention it."
4.0,The arm and waist are a little small
4.0,I ordered a size small and it fits at expected. The reason I’m giving this four stars instead of five is there is a small hole in the ankle seam. It’s not very large; but I’d expect quality control to catch something like that. I love the pattern and the pink coloring. Really like these leggings. Definitely will consider buying from this brand again.
4.0,Fits the Fitbit well. Only issue is that there are small tears already where the Fitbit goes. Other than that it’s a nice bad.
4.0,"These sunglasses are great for glare and sun. We live in Washington State and we can have cloudy skies with sun peaking through, creating a bunch of glare when driving. I wore these right after receiving them down the freeway to drop a family member off at the airport. Lots of glare off the other cars and just sunny/cloudy. I did not have to squint like I usually do when driving in these conditions. The amber lens was a big difference in these conditions. I took them off for a short time during the drive and just squinted the whole time. These glasses are very light weight.<br /><br />The nose pieces are well attached and comfortable. Slightly moveable to fit different shaped noses. The arms are thin and light, but strong. After the two hour drive to the airport I did not have sore spots behind my ears like most sun glasses.<br /><br />It comes with the case that protects the glasses and includes a cleaning rag.<br /><br />We boat in the summer and both daughters life guard. I can't wait until we can try these both on the water and at the water park. I am sure these will be perfect.<br /><br />I did receive these glasses at a discount for my honest and fair review."
4.0,"Really good boots. They’re a lot warmer than standard safety toe boots due to the non metallic cap in the toe. Pretty much waterproof from what I can tell. The insoles are really high quality as well. They’re stiff and take some getting used to and they’re actually quite difficult to put on due to the rigidity of them but once they’re on , you’re good to go. The selling point for me was that there’s no leather. It’s all nylon and rubber. I’ve had them for about two weeks in the middle of a particularly cold Michigan winter and they’re working really well for me as a contractor."
4.0,Daughter was very happy with these shorts. Soft.
4.0,Second time I've purchased. Very pretty oversized glasses. Price can't be beat. Quality is great for $10.
4.0,"Should have ordered a small, but it is well made and served its purpose for a wedding."
4.0,"My kiddo loves her's! Her friend liked them as well, so much I purchased a second pair as a gift for her. The only issue I had was the velcro on one shoe started to fall off, i just glued it back on. Easy fix!"
4.0,These are a pretty good buy but not very strong. Good for light jobs.
4.0,Fits true to size. I'm a 36DD and ordered a size large. I'm only giving 4/5 stars because I don't like that it squishes my breasts together rather than pulling them in.
4.0,Silver rubs off
4.0,Runs small but looks great
4.0,"I originally ordered a large but exchanged it for the extra large.  Typically wear an 8 or 10.  LOVE the shirt!  Very soft, and so cute!"
4.0,These where smaller than I expected but very cute and the hypoallergenic option was awesome as my child's ears are very sensitive and tend to react to the cheep earrings that can be bought at the local stores.
4.0,Exactly what I was searching for.
4.0,"So I bought this for 2 reasons one as a beach cover up and the other to potentially wear out but when I received it i found the material to be far so thin to be worm as anything as beach cover up. I also found it to tight in the bust, i ordered and XL and I wear a 40D and even as a beach cover up I knew it would be too constricting but otherwise you couldn't beat the price."
4.0,"The dress is very comfortable, very flattering.,stretch fits perfectly"
4.0,Just a little short. Will need to wear leggings with it.
4.0,"1- Special design for myopia<br /><br />2- Protect your eyes with clip on sunlgasses(TAC polarized Lens)<br /><br />3- Polarized lens help to eliminate reflected and scattered glares, restores vivid color<br /><br />4- Good for sports and other outdoor activities<br /><br />PRODUCT DIMENSION :<br /><br />Lens Width: 58mm(2.28inches)<br /><br />Lens height: 50mm(1.96inches)<br /><br />Temple Length: 145mm(5.70inches)<br /><br />Nose Bridge: 15mm(0.59inches)<br /><br />TIPS!<br /><br />To avoid damage, never clean your sunglasses with paper towels or clothing, and also …"
4.0,"I ordered two pairs in silver but they came in grey.  However, they are resending the silver frame so Thats better.  I did not give it five stars because they had a purple reflection on the inside lens, but they are made like that to see more clearly.  All in all they look nice for the price."
4.0,"Beautiful dress, very well made.<br />Heavy and not terrible like expected with Amazon honestly.<br />Much better than expensive dresses we found in expensive stores."
4.0,Over all I liked this product. It runs a little bit shorter than expected.
4.0,"Material is good but little bit thin, if you are wearing in winter months then buy something thick material."
4.0,Got this for my wife she said it was very fashionable but hard to wear in a quiet office setting because of the noise it makes  banging on things .
4.0,"I liked color and style, but it wasn’t as warm as I expected. It is really summer weight."
4.0,These are so cute . Only rating four stars because they came missing one of the nose pieces.
4.0,Super cute!!! But too small extra large would be a small
4.0,These pants fit great on my son we always have difficulty finding him good looking pants that do not fit into tightly at the waist and this one's work perfectly.
4.0,"Really a great value! Good tank/camisole, mdecent support .<br />I wish there were ones with a bit sturdier straps, I wonder how they will hold up.<br />For the price, SUPER!"
4.0,I liked this very much.it is almost as nice looking in person as the pic you see. I bought my daughter 1 too and she's very pleased also.
4.0,Jacket runs small and outfit is thin. Nice color.
4.0,I have now purchased 2 of these dresses.  The large fit everywhere except the chest (36C).  The chest pulled on the buttons in front and created a gap.  I ordered up a size and it fits better.  The fabric is thin and great for summer.  It lays nicely and has cute big pockets that can hold some small items or your hands.
4.0,Love the doll but wanted the blue not red. Hopefully the blue will be available soon. The one I received is great though and can't wait till my Halloween party
4.0,The little princess loved it! That she keeps on wanting to wearing it!
4.0,"I love this for what I wanted. I wanted something to lounge around in pjs and be comfy and cozy and this does the job! Fits a bit big to wear out of the house. I am 5' 5&#34;, 102 pounds and this hits a bit below my knees. It says to hand wash but I always wash low or medium heat and dry the same temp and haven't noticed any fading,shrinking or thinning. I might eventually try to shrink it so i can wear it out but for now i really love how soft and comfy it is to lounge in. This is perfect for laying on the couch, watching a movie and wrapping it around you like a giant blanket. &#60;3 definitely a good buy,  exactly what i wanted and I would recommend!!! I do love this but I did knock it down one star because it is so big."
4.0,"The dress was very nice, but it was too big in the bust area."
4.0,"I took one star off because the band is so thin. For the money, it is a nice watch. However, once the stopwatch reaches 60 minutes, it starts over again. Every watch that I have had with a resin band has broken &amp; I have had about 10 of them. When the band breaks it is always on the watch part so a band would not be replaceable. My last watch was a Timex &amp; it lasted a little over a year. If this watch lasts that long I will be satisfied.  The batteries on all of the previous watches outlasted the band.The watch is very light &amp; thinner than most watches of this kind. It only has 3 buttons for the settings versus the usual 4. Also, it is not as large as the other watches I have had but the size is fine for me."
4.0,"I'm not a stripper or dancer and yet I really love these shoes.  Even though they are costume shoes with a faux platform and heel they still turn heads and look very sexy.  The ultra high-heel (6.75 inches) is surprisingly easy to walk in and these shoes are actually quite comfortable.  Wearing them has a positive effect on the legs; specifically the calves--making them look toned and sleek.  Note: they run a bit small so I would definitely recommend ordering one size larger then your actual foot.  Otherwise, party on and dance the night away.  Also they are a bargain price and look and feel nicer than the low price would suggest."
4.0,"These are pretty but very tiny, smaller than a pea. I would have purchased the larger ones or a different setting if I had seen a comparison to another object.  Despite this I like them and they seem well made-good for everyday wear if you don't want something too obvious or get in your way at work or play.  One of the backs is not quite tight enough so I keep checking to make sure they are still there. Shipment was quick."
4.0,"I ordered this for my husband who loves watches. The watch is large but that is the style he likes. I was disappointed that it wasn't silver as the picture appears to be, however the watch is a bright white. He was happy with all of the features and fit."
4.0,"Gotten a few compliments on it. Catches the eye. The green is definitely ‘sparklier’ than expected though that why I say cheap, but you get what you pay for."
4.0,I had to wait a while for it only to find it fits a little tight.
4.0,"Nice hat, cheap material and very thin and flimsy but nice design. You get what you pay for"
4.0,Material was just a little bit thinner than I was expecting it to be.
4.0,"Dress is cute, the fabric is a little stiff. The dress in general is well made But a little bit see through the under fabric. I did returned it because the lace reminded me good much of a tablecloth."
4.0,"34DD, 135lbs, 5'7<br /><br />Great fit! The white with dots needs a lining it is a smidgen see through. Other than that this dress is ADORABLE! 😁"
4.0,"My son is 8 and a large barely fit. He is an avg size so this should have been fine. Other than that, the quality is what I was looking for."
4.0,"The mask fit great. The tail has an elastic band that you’re supposed to be able to fit around your waist... the band was SO tiny with hardly any stretch. I tried it on my 9 year old daughter and it didn’t even fit around her waist. The product is nice, just wish the elastic band was bigger and had more stretch so it would actually fit someone over the age of 5 years old. Especially since it is advertised as “woman’s”."
4.0,"This watch looks exactly like the pictures. I won't be wearing it daily, but it is a fun conversation starter in small social settings. My only complaint is that the bezel is a bit loose. Other than that, it tells time well, keeps time well, and is extremely fun to look at!"
4.0,The waist fits a bit oddly on me<br /> The length is just below the knee. The chest is just right. The material feels a little cheesey. But...with a night out and a blazer over it I think it will look fine.
4.0,"I had a pair of these boots and they were AWESOME.  Looked great, felt great.  The only complaint I would have is they were a little tough to walk in over a long distance (over 2 miles) they would start to rub a bit.  And I'm a hiker and wildland firefighter so I have hiked sometimes all day with 75lbs on my back so it's not my feet that are the issue.  I guess you have to make some compromises for the fashion of these boots, they are killer and I lost my first pair but they are also expensive at $200+ so I am waiting to see if I can maybe find a pair around $150 or so."
4.0,Unique setting with nice stone. Not too big or small.
4.0,Love the way this fits! I wear a size 14 and carry most of my weight in my upper body and midsection. This dress fits like a glove and gives me a beautiful curvy shape even without shapewear underneath. I order a size XL and it has plenty of stretch. The material is somewhat shiny so it's perfect for my nighttime event!
4.0,The shorts are too wide at the bottom
4.0,wish it wasnt mostly cotton hot in warm weather but very cool!
4.0,"It’s refreshing when a company delivers on their promises! When they say, “Oversized,” you can take that to the bank. (But don’t use the drive-through, it won’t fit in that capsule.)<br /><br />It’s a bit loosely woven, but it allows the sweater to be less “sweat,” and breathe. Not in a creepy way like that dude in the trench coat on the park bench, but in a way that instead ensures your comfort. I haven’t tested it in strong light, but I usually wear a camisole under my tops, which seems like it may be a a good preventative measure for everyone in case the looser knit lends itself to a degree of opacity.<br /><br />The color is deep and even and beautiful. And while it is a *bit* larger than I expected, it encapsulates fall in all its cozy loops. Super comfortable, and indescribably soft. I’m not mad at it."
4.0,I only gave this sweatsuit 4 stars because the elastic band in the waist of the pants folds over and rolls around. I have received so many complaints when I’m wearing this outfit. It’s comfortable and easy to wear. I love that there’s tons of length in both drawstrings. Over all I love this outfit!
4.0,"I love them, but I had to give them to my wife. She said they looked to small for my head. She could've just swindled me out of some very cool shades. They're very well made. Thank you!"
4.0,"Cute pattern. Does hug the chest and stomach too much, I’d size up!"
4.0,"The fit is fantastic, particularly for taller customers like myself (5'10&#34;). The ends of the pants are already showing some fraying and signs of wear, but for the price ($19), I can't complain! These dress up easily for work and are comfortable enough for wearing around the house as well. The material is quite thin, making these suitable for summer and early fall."
4.0,My daughter loves it. I just wish it had more features.
4.0,I am 5'4 and I got a med but it is very long. Beautiful dress!
4.0,"The shirt fits well and looks nice,  but sometimes it feels a bit warm.  I believe the fabric is a little thick.  A softer fabric would probably be more comfortable,  but overall,  it's fine."
4.0,"Great quality product, nice strong material. well made and assembled well. Brilliant purple.  Fit runs extremely small.  I ordered a size larger and the item was still too small.  Made for very petite body frames, with narrow hips in mind.  I really wish it had fit properly."
4.0,Gift for my husband. He loves the colors and the way they fit.
4.0,I like the Cape but the hat not so much
4.0,I like the boots but one lace is longer than the other. They are not waterproof either.
4.0,"This show is super cute, I just wish I could wear it. I wear a size 12 in women's. However, depending on the shoe it could be a 12 or 12 wide or 12.5 or even 13. The shoe was a little challenging to put on as I had to unlace it quite a bit to do so. Price point is accurate for a shoe from JustFAB. If you have a narrow foot this shoe is for you!"
4.0,"They work very well as sunglasses which is the big thing.  I gave 4 stars instead of 5 as I don't like the way the fasten to my eyeglasses.<br />In the past clip-ons I've owned have a spring clasp in the center that when you squeezed it, it expanded the clips. That made it super easy to just place them, release your pressure on the clasp, and the grips would close on the lenses.<br /><br />These you just push onto the lens, it requires two hands to do it - One to support the frames, one to put pressure on the shades to slide on.  Nowhere near as easy as with the spring clamp\clasp arrangement.<br /><br />The other thing I'm not fond of is the case.  First case I've owned that hinged on the short end.  Feels awkward and unbalanced.<br /><br />As I said, they work great as sunglasses and that's the important thing!"
4.0,I have learned to buy one size larger for the USA.
4.0,The headgear was fine.  Had to return it because it was too large for our granddaughter.
4.0,Cheap but lots for the price point. Does the job of filling treat bags at Halloween.
4.0,"TALKED TO VENDOR , MADE DRESS CUSTOM TO ME, PERFECT ONLY THING IS THAT WITH HEELS IT WAS STILL LONG."
4.0,"This is good sized cross bag, it is looking smaller in pic but actually it’s not that small."
4.0,"Worked well for 16 and 20 hours days that we were flying.  The top band broke my skin, but I think it had to be in order to work.  Give yourself some time to put them on.  Get them onto your foot, then over the heel, then all the way up.  You could break a sweat getting into these if you were in a hurry, but they need to be snug."
4.0,My glasses broke within 5 days of wearing them. I did not drop them or handle them poorly. One of the arms just simply fell off. The plastic was not high quality and I'm very disappointed. ***UPDATED**** They have sent me a replacement pair.
4.0,"They are small, but natural looking"
4.0,"This is a beautiful corset but it is WAY small!  I wear an XL, it looks like a medium. A friend of mine loves this corset so she may buy it.  If not, I'll have to return it.  It arrived much sooner than expected so I was very pleased with that."
4.0,My husband was pleased.
4.0,"Elastic in sleeves it tight. I ended up cutting a small hole and removing the elastic from each sleeve. Also, I tried to do this with the shorts, but the elastic is sewn in."
4.0,I like the dress a lot even though it did not end up being the print it was in the picture. I get tons of compliments every time that I wear it. I was going to get it in another color but the price has gone up quite a lot since I bought it so I will hold off.
4.0,"I may eventually take it  in as it is a bit large. But it is almost exactly what I was looking for when I bought it. Good colors, a little bling, longer length."
4.0,This is a very nice blouse.  Very stylish.  I received several compliments the evening I wore it.  The only reason I am giving it 4 and not 5 stars is because it does ride up.  I had to pull is down and readjust it several times throughout the night.  If I had gone larger it would have changed completely lost its shape so this may be because I'm a little busty  not sure.  Overall this is a good blouse I would recommend (actually did) and buy again
4.0,Nice apron to have for cleaning if you do it daily. My daughter used this for her styling tools. she liked it enough to use it frequently. Comes in hand when you need to keep switching out tools and need them near by.
4.0,Wonderful texture. Cozy. Good size. But the only resin I don't rate it 5 stars is because it has a bright yellow line that I don't like and I couldn't see in the picture that it has it. But I'm ok with the rest.  So I'm keeping it. Thank you
4.0,It fits well.  It needs some way to keep it closed.  Maybe a belt or buttons?  my wife loves it but wishes it would stay closed to keep her warm.
4.0,Beautiful earring I gave them 4 stars because the post is very thin and bends easily. You have to be careful how you store them so the post doesn't bend.
4.0,"I usually wear a Medium & Large depending on the fabric, however I purchased an XL being fabrics from China run small. The blouse fitted nicely and not too snug, so glad I brought the XL because the arms run small. Overall, it's a beautiful blouse!"
4.0,My daughter absolutely likes her necklace. Delivery was a little complicated but not the sellers fault
4.0,Good value for the money. We ride a few hours a week and these work well for that.
4.0,"Very nice glove.  Give me a month or so on the mountain bike, and I will tell you if they hold up like a Pearl Izumi.  LOL!"
4.0,Fabric is soft and comfortable but waist is too small.
4.0,"This sweater is nice for the price. It's warm, yet not too heavy. I machine washed it in a lingerie bag and let it air dry.  It came out great!"
4.0,Pretty set. I receive compliments each time I wear it.
4.0,"Is so beautiful, light, confortable, and flattering. Its a little bit see-through, so buyers who want to use this in a professional setting beware. Your bra may show through. But will work under a blazer.  I'm 5'5&#34;, 140 lbs, and 34C,  and bought the medium size. It fits perfect.  Now I want to buy the other colors available."
4.0,"Cute jeans. But too large and too long.  Expected a tighter fit, or else why make them out of stretch material? Not sexy; more like comfy."
4.0,"It fits me a little big, but as the name says, it is for men, so that's probably why it was big. Other than that it is awesome!"
4.0,sort of heavy but cute
4.0,I put these on my backpack and they were cute but they do fall off if put through thick fabric. I would recommend them tho they are good quality.
4.0,"I thought this would run small so I ordered a medium. I'm 6 months preggo, 5'1 and 125 lbs. Pre preg. weight about 105..... It is a little big but I don't like tight clothes and it covers by bottom so I'm going to keep it. I would probably order a small if I were to order again...."
4.0,The background color is white. In the photo is looks more ecru. But the colors are vivid and it goes with everything.
4.0,"chafed the nipples slightly, but a good fit."
4.0,"They shipped fast and arrived as described, I just wish it was more specific on what age group of kids these fit. I saw some for adults, and some for children, but these are for Toddler aged. My girls are 8-11 and they are small for them."
4.0,"Pieces are adorable but I had on gem fall out and the pieces are looser fitting into the plastic. Overall, they are nice!"
4.0,"Great leather shoe for the price. Child loves wearing them so they must be comfortable. After 4th wearing for mass at school, toe somewhat scuffed (child is very active 5 year old - so not unexpected). Nothing that some black marker won't fix. Will buy again for required but occasional use."
4.0,It's very pretty but the lace is somewhat rough and can rub against my arms if I'm active so I don't wear this suit too long.
4.0,It was very unique and cute. Got a lot of compliments!
4.0,Bought for my son.
4.0,This looks exactly like the picture.
4.0,it's perfect!
4.0,"purchased to clear a c-section scar while I recover. Fits above bellybutton about 1.5 inches. I purchased the S/M and my current waist is 29inches, and hips 38inches. I'm 5'11&#34; and 145lbs. These fit snug, not tight. Although, if anyone has abdominal tenderness, the waistband may create too much pressure so I'd size up. They will probably fit me as well when I get back to my usual waist of 27 inches. Fabric is similar to seamless from Victoria's Secret."
4.0,"My daughter loves this little cropped tank top! The mocha color is so pretty. The fabric is a bit stretchy, but still feels tight and holds its shape. It has a built in bra, which she doesn't normally like, but finds this one supportive and flattering. The length is great, hitting just above her belly button, and the criss-cross on the back is a cute detail. The only thing she does not like is dealing with the pads in the bra. After washing, they end up folded in on themselves and you have readjust them before wearing. She doesn't want to remove them entirely, though, because then there won't be enough coverage. But she's willing to deal because she loves the top so much."
4.0,"For me, the dress is true to its size.  I was skeptical in ordering the dress - but I am pleasantly pleased.  I only tried it on and haven't worn it yet to my event."
4.0,"Socks are very good but not quite what I expected.  They are compression socks but seem to only have compression In certain areas, namely across the instep and arch.  Perhaps it is in Others areas as well but difficult to tell.  They never say what the mg compression really is.  Still and all I still like them and where them much of the time (I only have two pair).  I do recommend them."
4.0,Excelente  Ropa de entrenamiento
4.0,Authentic looking dress for early 30's show. Well made.
4.0,Ok but just not quality I expected
4.0,"This is a beautiful lace top. It is made very well. Unfortunately it runs small.  I am a size 4, I ordered a small. It is to tight around my torso making me look flat chested. I think a medium will be fine."
4.0,"This is a good base for a Yor cosplay, but it needs to be modified:<br />- the tights fall down as soon as I start walking.<br />- the shoulder straps are long and confusing<br />- the chest straps are too long<br />- skirt is a little long on me<br />- flowers on headband are too far back<br /><br />The good thing is the main fabric is very nice, and the rose fabric is nice too. It was also pretty cheap. I'm 34-26-35, height 5'4"" and I got size S."
4.0,"Love it but it's not as bright of a pink as the sellers photo shows. it's more of a baby pink. It doesn't fall out as long as you don't wipe your face with towel or clothes. Haven't lost it yet, that's a plus! Thanks!"
4.0,My boyfriend likes it a lot. Thought the buckle & that it switches to make the belt reversable was nice. Fits just fine. 6ft 2 about 230lbs.
4.0,Talk about your &#34;statement&#34; necklace!  This is absolutely gorgeous and I can't wait to wear it with this black velvet tank dress that I have.  I knocked it down one star simply because I don't care for the sort of clanky sound the piece makes when it moves.  But its a beautiful piece and I am sure I am going to get compliments on it.  Might have to get it in another color too!
4.0,"I love the material and color. Fits just right. For reference, I'm 5'1"", 110 lbs. Loose but not bulky. I can still see my body shape. Has enough room for a thin long-sleeved shirt underneath for colder days. Looks good layered with a medium-length jacket."
4.0,"Just what was needed for chilling at home.  Longer length than I wear, but I just roll up the cuffs. The cat doesn’t care."
4.0,Loved it. Adorable.
4.0,I’m sure my grandson’s gonna love the robe I got a tan but it looks small so I’m going to have to exchange it probably for a 12 my grandsons 10 and he’s tall and thin so I’m hoping to 12 will fit
4.0,Product fit as described. I wasnt expecting the fabric to be as shiny as it is.
4.0,I look wonderful in this and I feel and look like the Queen that I am.  The color is simply awesome!
4.0,"It's unfortunate that the two front pockets aren't useable. Other than that, it's awesome! Great compartments."
4.0,"I got the red one for my Pepa (salt-n-pepa) costume.  I'm about 140lbs, 5'7"" & an A cup so the large fit ok. It's see through so good luck with under garments. I wore a jacket that covered me so it worked out in my favor but to wear it by itself would definitely be revealing."
4.0,"I am 5'-4&#34; tall and weigh ~120 pounds. I typically wear a US size 2 or a small or medium in similar women's styles from Victoria's Secret. I typically wear a size 36C bra. I ordered the Astylish Womens Solid Sexy Lace Transparent Bralette Lingerie Set in a size Medium based off of the provided dimensions from the seller in the item description. Overall, the top and bottom had very different fits and make it difficult for me to rate. The fit of the top is fantastic. Alone, I would give this piece 5 stars. It provides enough support to wear the bralette under a low back tank top or dress and show the lace. It is also comfortable to sleep in. The lace is smooth and not itchy. The seams are all well constructed and comfortable against the skin. Overall, the bralette is a fantastic buy. Similar styles retail for $20+, at $10 this is a great bargain.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I cannot say the same about the matching boyshorts. The bottoms fit more like a large or x-large. They are loose throughout and have a tendency to ride up, especially while sleeping. This makes them very uncomfortable. I don't see myself being able to wear these again at my current size. Ultimately, for $10, the bralette alone is a great price and the matching panties are a wash. A similar pair of panties in the correct size is only a few dollars at Charlotte Russe, Aerie or Victoria's Secret. I would happily order this set in other colors despite the mismatched top and bottom sizes, but beware of this anomaly when making your own purchases.<br /><br />I hope you found this review helpful. If so, I'd appreciate you clicking the &#34;helpful&#34; button!"
4.0,"price was good, material seemed a little flimsy. was a gift for my wife she liked the color and pattern."
4.0,Good hat for 4.41. Only complaint is as soon as I got it a snap button broke first use other than that I'm happy for the price.
4.0,Overall these are pretty decent looking sunglasses. would have preferred a different color though. When wearing I noticed that the nose pads were not perfectly aligned and caused it to be slightly angled but its totally adjustable.
4.0,They look great on just wish they'd stay put a little better but the complete an outfit and look good. I'd recommend them if you got an outfit to go with them or just wear them by them selves for a fun time with your partner
4.0,"I love this purse!!! I get tons of compliments from both males and females alike. I have to order another one because after everyday use, it's certainly gotten its wear and tear. I wouldn't pack it to much because it is plastic after all but worth the fashion statement. I've had it about a month!!!"
4.0,They stay on my 4 year old all day.  They are nice and bright and sparkly and she likes them.  We'll probably get her ears pierced in a few years but for now these work well.  She does find it a little uncomfortable to put them on since I do have to put some pressure behind my squeeze when I attach them.
4.0,"Would have given this bag 5 stars but to me it was a little small. Love the quality of the leather and the hardware on the bag looks custom. Really great that is has 2 straps, one for handbag and on for cross body. I actually have both on this bag and it looks great. I bought this bag especially for the two front zip pockets, deep enough to be useful and the 2 slip pockets on the side. If you want a true grey color this bag has it. As I said I would have liked this bag to be bigger but that is only my preference. Have been using this bag everyday for a week now and I like it and receive many compliments. If you like a medium size compact bag go with this one."
4.0,"The Etip works great and the gloves have a nice grip.  However, the material snaps easily on Velcro."
4.0,Very nice for the price however some slide down your face
4.0,"I would put this product in the slipper category, as it is not for long hikes in the woods. Good for getting the newspaper in the morning, going out to refill the bird feeder, and taking the trash out to the end of the driveway. They have no arch support so it is like walking barefoot, except you are nice and warm and comfortable. Can't wear them around the house, unless you don't heat the house, as they are warm and make your feet sweat, which makes your feet cold inside the slipper."
4.0,These undies are comfortable and supportive
4.0,"Smaller than I thought, but usuable"
4.0,Soft. Warm. Fits well.
4.0,"I like the style and the materials used, but for my face these seemed small.  I can get away with wearing them and I have worn them, but they accentuate my nose because they are on the smaller side.  I like the plastic used and they do not look cheap, but the lenses are oval and do not follow the cat eye shape, so I will probably look for  a different pair and keep these in my bag for the beach or in my car...they're not my favorite.  They have a cute fox on the sides and overall seem pretty strong so if you are more petite, I recommend them but I don't recommend them for a larger person or for a tall person."
4.0,"My only note on this shirt is that the material was a bit heavier than I expected.  Which is good from the standpoint of durability, expectation that the shirt will hold its shape well, no visible underwear lines showing through, etc.  But I wouldn't choose it for days warmer than low 70s."
4.0,Good but a little too large.
4.0,"My daughter is normally a size 4 shoe, but I bought the 4.5 &amp; its a perfect fit! The shoes are heavy! She insists they’re not, but I disagree. She loves them!"
4.0,The swim cap looks beautiful and has a nice heft. Several ladies asked me where I got it.<br /><br />Taking off one star because it was much larger than expected.  Need to pull it down far on the forehead if you have a small head and are bald as the cap came off the first time I dived in :-o.  This should not be a problem for someone with hair.
4.0,They are great except that they have a label sewn on the top of the insert and it is annoying. Maybe they should put their name on the bottom of the insert.
4.0,[[VIDEOID:39b8d8d4d7bf0f28885ba4a365530d3e]] I don’t like that it says cucci on it but overall it’s very pretty and looks luxurious worn with the right outfit. Love the design and color scheme. It’s pretty long so great to wear in colder weather
4.0,Runs small soft and well seen so size up If you don’t want your ladies falling out
4.0,"This fit and looked exactly as described, but it was just too hot for me to wear.<br />I usually wear a L and I got this in a M due to the reviews and I must say it does run large.. but if you size down you end up with a tight, form-fitting version of this instead of the loose, comfortable one as advertised.. therefore, I would not recommend sizing down. The material was on the cheaper side.. but it still looked cute and was very soft. Would definitely look cute with some leggings and booties.. and can easily look sexy all on its own.<br />I think the price reflects its quality!"
4.0,Super cute. Bought for my neice. Seems to run on the smaller side.
4.0,Outfit was super cute! Pants are longer than expected. True to size!
4.0,"The top is really nice but, even after washing it, some of the folds are still very noticeable. I will try washing it again."
4.0,"I liked the detail but I wish it was more functional. You can't really use it as a true sweater which was a bummer. Im a texture person, I just didn't really care for the material used but to be fair I didn't read the full description. I wish it would have had soft liner or something that made it more comfortable on the skin."
4.0,"Very handy and spacious.  Canvas was a little too lightweight, however.  Still...would purchase again."
4.0,"They are unique,  however they are delicate the clip falls off easily."
4.0,"One of the connecting straps broke while trying this on. So it's obviously poorly made, but very cute. Be prepared to go without underwear and have to navigate the bra situation."
4.0,Seems like the run a little tight but I love them so easy to match up and they wash really well no fuzz.
4.0,"Very cute, the zipper pouch holds way more than expected. My only complaint is the strap is pretty short, I switched mine out for a longer one."
4.0,Average quality for the price.
4.0,"The material feels great. Stretchy. All pockets have zippers. However, it didn’t fit me. I am 5’2 162lbs and ordered a large. I couldn’t close it even if I “sucked it in” hahaha I’m on a mission to lose weight so I won’t be returning these. I would size up if I was going to return :) happy shopping!"
4.0,"I think I would have enjoyed the jacket because it was extremely light and can be folded to fit in a large size pocket.  However, the waist fits small.  I returned it for a larger size, like my jackets to fit loose."
4.0,"I am normally a size 18. 5'9 and 265 lbs. The xl was a perfect fit. And very slimming in the tummy arean it really is a true hugh waist. I maybe could have done a large. Its tighter below the knee..but the stretch is generous. I was surprised at how stretchy they were...my ONLY con is the inner lining material...i am a little extreme about clothing material, i really wish the inner lining was a softer material. Other than that the outside is very soft. Looks exactly as pictured. Will definitely look at buying more of their jeans."
4.0,"It was good for the price. A bit on the larger side. The T-shirt print was not perfect, but it was okay. The hat was good."
4.0,"Good value, thought it would be cheaply made. Made well. Perfect for the grill cooker on his birthday"
4.0,Love the fabric the colour i usually wear large in forever 21 but need a xl and since the matetial is very thick it is king of  tight be aware for the back fat i don’t have a lot i have more muscles and it shows the fat since it is tight
4.0,"I like them, they are nice and appear to be well made.I would probably order from them again."
4.0,"Adorable top but was HUGE on me.  I sew, thankfully, and was able to do my own alterations.  I recommend buying smaller than your usual size."
4.0,I love it super cute. only reason i give it a 4 star is because ravenclaw mascot is an eagle not a raven.
4.0,"Seems like a well made case, I did pay separately for a glass screen protector because this had no protection.<br />For that I gave 4 stars."
4.0,"6x-7 size for 3 year old. I was expecting to have a bit more room, but the fit is correct for her sizing. It fits, currently. Four stars for the slightly low neckline. Wish it was just a tad higher, but love the sleeve length one this one."
4.0,It’s pretty good and it fits the description but my only problem is the jersey is quite large while the shorts are fairly small and tight fitting despite me following the size chart
4.0,"I was excited for this dress. I usually wear M/L tops and size 16 pants... true pear shape. Honestly reading reviews makes it hard to shop online because I feel a majority of reviews are geared towards large chested women rather than small chests and wide hips.  This dress, be aware, runs large. They consider an L dress a 14/16... this is more like an XL sizing. For me since I would buy an L dress but wasn’t sure based off of other reviews and felt going for a M would t fit my hips... the top is rather large on me. No problem, I alter my own clothes all the time. The fabric is really nice though, way more heavy than I thought it would be. It will be nice come fall. The skirt part is stuff and doesn’t have much swing to it... it is also pleated in the skirt which maybe makes it sick out in a few places. I’m going to try steaming or ironing this areas to see if I can soften them up. Either way I’ll make it work.<br />One star off because I feel like I’m going to have to do a lot of my own work to make it work for my body."
4.0,Nice dress. But when washed the black flowers sheds bits of threads on the inside of the dress. I still love the dress though.
4.0,I bought 3 pairs in different colors of these socks - glad I did.  They are very comfortable and very soft on the skin.  I wasn't sure if there would be enough or too much support - for my needs they were just right.  With some socks i had marks on my legs from the elasticity of the tops but it didn't happen with these.
4.0,"These shorts are phenomenal! They feel like butter, have large side pockets, are opaque, & the chub rub hasn’t worn through them yet! I now have a total of 4 pairs of these shorts & will absolutely buy more in the future."
4.0,"Long sleves , short dress ,, but it's adorable with leggings"
4.0,I get lots of compliments.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because it got foggy.  I washed it and put clear nail polish on it and it looks great.
4.0,"Love the picture, but the metal was cracked.  I had just lost my little Bichon and thought this would be a nice memory."
4.0,"I ordered L instead of my usual M since I am a size 8-10 everywhere, but being made in China I knew to order up a size. I thought I'd need the L to put it on since there are no buttons or zippers. I could pull it over my hips okay but it can also be put on over your head. That being said, I should have ordered the M. The skirt is loose around my waist and there is just so much material that it makes me feel like a cow, like my butt has it's own zip code. The fabric is real denim, albeit lightweight, and is well made. It washes fine without any shrinkage that I detected (wish it had). The dye job on the fabric could have been better - the faded areas are more like chunks instead of a gradual fading in and out. I may dye it myself. I will likely take it to the tailor shop to get some of the fabric removed so it's not quite so bulky in the front, which is pleated; the back is lightly gathered. All this being said, I'm mostly happy with this skirt: you simply cannot find a long denim skirt anywhere anymore. This skirt comes almost to my ankle - I'm 5'6&#34;. I look forward to several years of wear with this skirt. I would buy it again. PS: the belt is super ugly but the skirt doesn't look right without a thick belt; I recommend buying a different one."
4.0,"Nice necklace, arrived on time product exactly like described"
4.0,Material is nice and fits gear!
4.0,I bought this in the summer. Item arrived from Hong Kong in about 2 weeks from my order date. The sleeve ends are folded however they werent sown straight. So I had to iron it a bit so it would fold more outwards so the inside threads wouldnt show.<br /><br />I wear size XS and it fits me comfortably and loose. I would recommend it if you dont mind ironing incase yours comes a bit defected. But what do you expect for this price...
4.0,Unpackaged well.  I like that I can tighten the fit.
4.0,"This is so cute and goes great with my sunglasses, I just wish it was a little longer. This would be great for a kid."
4.0,"Nice!  4/5 - White part on underwear is slightly yellow / faded, otherwise great! ++++"
4.0,These are really cute. I love the colors and the fit. These should fit most peoples' necks comfortably but there will be exceptions. I can't comment on the durability. The bag it comes with is kind of useless.
4.0,"I like the design of these sandals very cute but they fit somewhat large I ordered a size 8 but were too big, I would order a size down I'm planning to order a 7 next time"
4.0,True to picture.  Very well made. Good quality.  The reason for the 4 star rate - It has a more metallic look that wanted but could not find this look anywhere else (closest) & the color could be a little darker.
4.0,"it's nice, great for the price and soft material"
4.0,These frames are a little too big for me. The yellow ones feel like safety goggles.
4.0,"Amazon Deal of the Day purchase... a hoodie for less than $20 is hard to turn down.  However, this hoodie is incredibly thin... like tshirt material thin... can't really complain for the price though."
4.0,Its definitely roomy. My only suggestion is that the legs are a little short for a person taller than 5'7&#34;.
4.0,The sleeves are really short but the rest of it fits well and is a good material
4.0,"The Truth belt truly does what it’s supposed to do; it provides seamless support of the garment it’s attached to. No bulky buckle where you least wish to have added bulk. The woven pattern of the elastic is nice, but I’d also like one that is more embellished  to use with less casual looks."
4.0,Love the cape. Only problem was some white patches on hood
4.0,Cute if you don’t want it extremely tight fbuy a size larger
4.0,Perfect to match my Tshirt for College day; love it.
4.0,Lovely print.  Super accessory for a sleeveless outfit.
4.0,Perfect beautiful
4.0,"A little short in the front, but still a great tunic!"
4.0,I like it! I did replace the loop end with an arrowhead pendant.
4.0,Just a hair shorter than I wish.
4.0,Fit great only down side to these was how high waisted they are. But I love them and would gladly buy again.
4.0,These protective goggles were just what we needed to fit over glasses.
4.0,Works well and has every feature you could need.
4.0,"Love these pants. Durable material, fit as expected and comfortable. Only complaint is that since the material is thicker, they're a bit warm."
4.0,"Bought the green elf one and the same suit in a ""different brand"" because Prime shipping had a delay and it wouldn't get here in time for a party.  Quality isn't the best, the pattern doesn't match up perfectly, and the zipper is cheap BUT it fit quite well actually and was an absolute knockout at a Christmas party I went to at the beginning of December.  It was a ""Christmas onesie"" party and everyone wore big baggy pajama onesies except me -- I showed up in a skin-tight full body spandex suit.  I was really nervous and had to have quite a few drinks to get up the courage to show up in this, but with a cheap elf hat and cheap elf shoes (bought here on Amazon, of course) everyone LOVED the outfit!  They said I ""won"" the onesie party by far, people kept commenting on my outfit and friends and strangers kept asking me for pics with me!  So I was in a lot of selfies with people LOL!  I'm pretty fit so I think I pulled this off, but if you're looking for a different outfit for a Christmas party GO FOR IT!  I'm totally wearing this at another party Christmas Eve this year, we'll see if I get hit on as much at that one!"
4.0,Love it! It was a great christmas gift
4.0,probably on the higher end of silicon wedding bands.  I can tell you the color is really different than what you see in the box.  Maybe because of the photo or the back set colors it's actually a light gray and white ring.  it fit's like an 8mm ring.  I wear a 10 to 10.5 on ring size it and it fits snug but comfortably.  Most of the time i don't notice it's there.
4.0,"Cute pendant, good gift. Chain doesn’t seem very durable."
4.0,Great buy for the Money.
4.0,"The little owl and clock are cute.  It's not anything fancy , but it's a fun piece.  The chain however won't last it's very thin and rough.  I intend to replace it."
4.0,A bit smaller and less sturdy than I would have liked but it is absolutely adorable and at a good price
4.0,Ordered wrong color but decided to keep them.  Very comfotyable.
4.0,Cute run a little bigger than expected
4.0,So I really wish they had half sizes. These have GREAT support but wearing them the first time on a HUGE walking vacation I have band aids everywhere cause the straps rub hard. My husband said its probably improper fit. Like I said support is great just the straps rub hard. Maybe I'll try to wear socks with them
4.0,Good for just a throw around pair of sunglasses
4.0,Awesome shirt! And the fabric is very nice. It’s a little more cream than white. And it was a little shorter than your average long sleeve tee but I do love it!!!
4.0,Easy to wear and a great bargain. In the summer this skirt replaces jeans because it is light and comfortable.
4.0,Beautiful just as advertised
4.0,This is cute for the cat lover! Our kitten thinks it is a cozy treat!
4.0,Great shirt!  Received a lot of compliments on it!
4.0,"I bought the blue tie dye print.<br />PROS:<br />- Love the color and jumpsuit matches the photo in listing.<br />- Also love that it has pockets and an easy drawstring waist.<br />- Although the fabric is a bit thicker than expected (and definitely not cotton), could be comfortable in temps of 70's & 80's, air conditioned rooms.<br />CONS:<br />- Size Chart listed is completely off.  I bought size Small and it is atleast 1 (or possibly) 2 sizes too big.  For ref, I am 5' 2"" and 115pds, 36C.  I had probably 2-3inches of EXTRA fabric under the arms.<br />- Also, much too long waisted.  (Probably more appropriate for someone 5'6"" in height).<br />- Leg was a bit too big, but doable.<br />BOTTOM LINE:<br />- Unfortunately, I must return based on size specs being too large.  Therefore, just keep in mind when ordering and size down 1 or more sizes."
4.0,"I like the look and style.  I bought the blue and red boots from a different vendor years ago, but these silver boots are a little tighter fit."
4.0,"I have a smaller than average head, but the fit of the hat runs small so it doesn't slouch very much if at all. Super cute dispite fitting a little tighter than expected. So it doesn't look slouchy, but the braided knit it has looks good with the tighter fit It comes in anyways."
4.0,I was very careful when buying clothes through Amazon not to purchase things that are shipped from China because of bad past experiences. I tried to find what I could about where this dress would be coming from as it greatly affects sizing but couldn't find anything that indicated it was coming from China. Until I got the shipping notification and found it was coming from CHINA! I was frustrated with this as I was sure that my product would be too small.<br />Surprise! When I received my dress quicker than I had anticipated it fit perfectly. It was true to the size that I had ordered. It has a shiny silky finish to it that I wasn't anticipating and didn't necessarily love but it it SO comfortable. The color is great and I love wearing it. It isn't as flattering as some of my other maxi dresses but that's just a matter of personal fix.<br />Overall it wasn't as perfect as I had hoped it to be but it's a very comfortable cute dress and a fabulous price.
4.0,Cute. Comfortablle to walk in.But not if your going to be standing for hours. I like the looks and quality.
4.0,Wow what a beautiful piece!! I'm assuming that the description meant to say 1 piece instead it says 1 pair. I did not receive a pair which is what I wanted I only received 1 piece. Was this in error?
4.0,"Slightly tight at first. Not so bad I couldn’t wear them, just noticeably tight... wore them for a few while puttering around the house to break them in, and they’ve relaxed a bit and are comfortable now"
4.0,These are beautiful! It would have been a 5 star review if they weren't so pricey.
4.0,If not for the sizing- it is great otherwise. Will order a bigger size.
4.0,"My measurements are 5'7&#34; 36D waist 31&#34; hips 41&#34;. Bottom fits snug but not too bad,  cups fit great, strap around the body was 3 inches too big, weird. I did alterations and now it fits great."
4.0,"I'm a 34ddd I bought pasties and this shirt. Without a bra it hugs extremely tight on my chest. It's a very cute shirt, I'm in the middle of losing weight, so hopefully I'll lose some in the chest to fit it correctly. Other than the chest being very tight the rest is as float as expected."
4.0,Very cute! More rips in the shirt than I expected and very long but could be because I am short 5'2!
4.0,"These fit well, tts!"
4.0,"Let me first say I love this bag, I really do. The size is fantastic. You can put a ton of things inside of this bag. I used it as a purse with the handles only. The look of this bag is very nice with a fade slighlty worn appearance to the faux leather. Mine was in the Coffee color. Unfortunatly the bag did not live up to my expectations in terms of quality. First one of the straps came apart where the metal ring goes through the loop. The loop came away from the bag. I was able to stitch the flap back on to the bag. This is how much I loved this bag, that I was willing to fix it myself. Next to fall apart was the lining along the handles. The thin rubber accent started to peel off. This was all within a six month period of time.<br /><br />Now, I carry heavy things in my purse (books, small laptop etc) so I know that that was definitely a contributor to the issue with the metal ring flap detaching. Even knowing that I still love this bag and I still use it, albeit on the weekends instead of as a work bag. I would buy it again and would recommend anyone else to buy it as long as you are not using it for heavy items."
4.0,I love this band. It makes my Fitbit look dressy and stylish. I've had many compliments on it. It's very stylish and sturdy. It is a little difficult to put on by yourself because the clasp is small. But overall I would highly recommend this product.
4.0,The quality is okay but it's what you get for the cost and my husband wanted an area for his id.
4.0,"This arrived quickly. It fits great. My son loves it! The gloves could be of better quality, but they work for their purpose."
4.0,"I like the shirt a lot, hangs just right, it is a great fit and the fabric is of nice quality.  The only negative is the sleeves are slightly short."
4.0,This is a nice s shirt for Christmas.  But it came pretty wrinkled & was still wrinkled after washing & drying.  I had to iron it to finally get all the wrinkles out.  But the price was cheap and it was comfortable and soft.
4.0,"First and foremost, make sure to order a size up, if not two.  My normally M-sized wife had to have an XL in this item.  Other than that, these work well.  Keep in mind, they don't get HOT hot to the point they are uncomfortable to the touch.  Rather, the heat is subtle and spread over a relatively wide area.  My wife routinely works outdoors and says these are a lifesaver for winter weather in the midwest."
4.0,Fits tight at the waist but overall great skirt.. I can dress it up or down!
4.0,I love this shirt. Fits comfy and I've ordered several in different colors
4.0,Charms are nice. Chains break easily
4.0,Not the color I was expecting but well made.  Took off a star
4.0,For the price I gave it 4 stars.
4.0,Good quality. Somewhat larger.
4.0,"Cute dress for summer. The size small fit well. I am 5 ft 1 in and the hem hit about an inch above my knee. The material is kind of thin. It's a good dress to wear on a hot day. I would order another one, but the blue tie-dye is sold out."
4.0,"I love the way these shirts fit, the only reason I gave it 4 stars and not 5. Is because the black is not black, its more like a darker gray color. Definitely not black."
4.0,They were just what my son wanted they smell really good. I was worried they would all smell the same or nasty because they were all together but they didn't. I was really surprised. Wish they has scented ones but these are all I could find. My sons happy and I'm happy win for us.
4.0,LOVE THESE!<br />They came in on time and I've received countless compliments!<br />Only thing is i have sensitive ears so i had to change out the ear stud.
4.0,I work out 6 days a week and was looking for tank tops with large arm holes so my fancy workout bras could show.  (I also thought it would be less restrictive when working out.  This tank top is perfect.  It fits well and isn't too long or too tight around the mid section.  The material is really nice as it doesn't cling to your body once its gotten wet from sweat.  I've since purchased more in other colors.  Very pleased with this purchase.
4.0,"Cute top, but runs small and doesn’t have a lot of stretch."
4.0,Use for playing pickleball. Work fine as a court shoe.
4.0,"I bought these for my 8th grade daughter, and she loves them! She even asked me to buy another set. They wash great and fit true to size. Very comfortable<br />We purchased size medium"
4.0,these don't really hold up but they're okay for the price.
4.0,"It is a good shirt but runs too large. The fabric is OK. Definitely will use it inside the jeans (I'm 5'3 and 107 pounds, ordered small)"
4.0,Flimsy but what can you expect for the cheap price
4.0,"These are soft and comfy! I had to cut a tiny bit between the middle toes bc my toes are long and it gave me a toe wedgie, if there is such a thing. After I did that, they fit great!"
4.0,very cute jeans...true to size...not a bluejean color...more of a vintage blue...would def purchase again
4.0,"Most of the reviews said to order a size up, but I went based off the size chart. I should've listened to reviewers, as this product was sliiiightly too short on me. I extended the straps out all the way and it was okay, but as someone with a short torso, I can't imagine how it wouldve been on someone taller. I'm 5'8&#34;, 135lbs, and a 34C. The material is beautiful though, and the outfit was thoroughly enjoyed by both parties."
4.0,Shipped very fast.  I must say no mater what wallet you purchase its never perfect but the wallets of today just don't  have the old bind fold holders for pictures.  In the end still happy on the purchase.
4.0,"These dresses are beautiful. I bought one a year or so ago (the Multicolour 2). The sizing seemed a little wonky. So, instead of ordering a small, as I usually do, I sized up and got a large. It fit very well. I've worn that dress a ton, and always get a lot of compliments on it. It's very comfortable, light-weight, flowy, and the fabric is not restrictive in anyway. I most recently purchased the ""Green"" (dark green with red and white flowers). I debated about the sizing because this dress has a different size chart than the Multicolour 2. After reviewing the chart, I ended up choosing a small. It fits like a glove - IF I don't lift my arms at all. The chest, waist, and length are great, but the sleeves of this particular dress are sewn in a way where the fabric has no give. Additionally, it is a different, thicker material than the first dress I ordered, where I had no movement limitations. It breaks my heart because the dress LOOKS like it fits perfectly, and the print is stunning in-person, but I don't think I can wear it comfortably (at some point, I may have to lift my arms, ha). I just ordered a different dress (which I think is the same sizing as the original Multicolour 2), so I'm going to see if that works better. If not, I'll try to order the Green in a size up. All in all, when you find the right size, they are gorgeous, multi-functional dresses. I've worn my old one to the beach, for casual hang-outs, and to weddings. You may have to be patient with the sizing, or order a couple or different sizes, and return the one that doesn't fit."
4.0,"They’re cute & appear to be the right size- however, the inner lining makes them unexpectedly snug and can make it difficult for kiddos to put on."
4.0,"Great product overall. Extremely practical to take off and put on, it was exactly what I wanted. The last Velcro tab however over time from taking off and putting on has become slightly easier to take off but it’s got like 4 more."
4.0,I like style but unable to wear because of medical problems
4.0,Fast delivery great pants
4.0,"I only didn't give 5 stars because the material isn't as thick as I thought. They are still cute, not see through or anything. I am 5'2'' and 135lbs and ordered a size L. I am so glad I found the zipper on the side! A perfect fit. Even the length is great, maybe one inch longer than I would like. These may be short for longer legs. Also, the buttons hang down so that looks weird. Still pretty cute overall!"
4.0,"Fabric is a polyester but not the shiny type of material.  Fits nicely.  I'm a 14/16 and ordered the 3XXX based on the reviews.  For the price, it's nice enough, although because of the fabric, not necessarily authentic."
4.0,Very pretty and sparkly. It fit very well. I put it in top to bottom as the other reviews mentioned and had no trouble.  The ball on bottom is close to the piece so it was a weird angle to screw back on but really troublesome. The only reason it did not get a 5 was bc the piece on the top is a bit large to hold the jewel so it doesn't sit as flush as I would have liked.
4.0,Got it for a Miami Heat fan for Christmas - he loved it.
4.0,"This is an awesome tumblr-esque shirt. It was a little itchy when I first put it on because a couple short loose threads on the inside of the shirt's at the armpit seams but after cutting them off with a scissor it wasn't itchy at all. The material is thin so it's kind of see through so I recommend wearing a tank top underneath. Overall though, this shirt is cute! Also I'm 5 feet tall, 90 pounds, and got the Asian small/US 0 and it fits perfectly."
4.0,"Very nice bag, decent size for a phone, plus keys, a small wallet.  The color is really more of a light gold- not what I needed for my outfit, but it might work great for yours!"
4.0,Don't like the trim but wearable. Will make it work
4.0,Doesn’t hang at the bottom like in picture but very soft.
4.0,"Bought it as a gift for my boyfriend. He loved it but as some reviews say, it’s hard to tell time with this one."
4.0,Hard to put the ball back into the earring other than that i wear them every day!
4.0,I got them in with a struggle. These were not undersized at all but a smidge to big. Photo will show the top bowing out but they aren’t coming out and they will get me through a night shoot. Very clear. When installing they did dent the Spy frames with an outline of the lens. Not mad hardly noticeable.
4.0,Bought for my Grandsons and they loved them.
4.0,Just received these in the mail and they are SOOOOO soft! I purchased them for the hospital after I have my baby for easy nursing access! They are going to be perfect. The ONLY reason I didnt give them five stars is because of my own personal preference on how the legs of my pj pants fit. I like more of a wide leg and these are more straight legged. I am also 5'8 and 145 lbs when I am not pregnant and I purchased a large. They are plenty long enough which can usually be a problem for me with being a tall girl. Would def buy again or as a gift for a mom to be!
4.0,Have worn this shirt once and am happy with it. The price is significantly less than that of &#34;the industry leader&#34; while the quality is at least equal.
4.0,Love how the feathers dangle. The only problem is the cuff for the ear is a little big and slides down ear. But I do like it otherwise.
4.0,Got a lot of compliments and super comfortable. The only reason I gave it a 4 star because I got a few strings sticking out here and there from it when I received it
4.0,"This shirt dress is just okay. I ordered it as a casual dress up dinner outfit, but the fit feels a bit frumpy. The middle material is ribbed and just does not lay right on me. It runs slightly larger, so it feels like an oversized sweater. The material is pretty see through. It’s not as noticeable with a darker color, and I can mostly hide where I don’t need people to see through it with an undershirt and leggings."
4.0,Found that product was too small for my adult face. Wear it occasionally
4.0,"Lightweight, comfortable, and cute. I got a lot of compliments while wearing this. I got one a size bigger, just to be safe and it was the right choice. Its capri length and was perfect for hot weather (I wore it alot in Greece)."
4.0,it works exactly
4.0,Cute! Fit my 3 year old perfectly.
4.0,"It‘s soft and warm, but the pearls not necessary."
4.0,I believe it runs big.
4.0,"Fits a camera, audio recorder, maps, guide book, pens, and a few snacks.  Great assortment of pockets.  The only drawback is the zippers are of mediocre quality, and jam."
4.0,Everything was great but however came with or quickly somehow ripped on the ankle cuff. Sorta sucks.
4.0,Decent quality for the money.
4.0,"Bought this for work, fits well and is warm, seems like it will last, the hood draw string is a little thin but that is me being picky."
4.0,"Looks like the photo. Very pretty but the feather part didn't last. We received it today and became unglued after one use. My daughter usually wears size 10, I ordered size 12 and fit fine for now."
4.0,"I ordered three cardiagns from this seller in size small.  Two of them fit perfectly.  One seemed stretched out, or just made too large.  It was more of a medium (though marked as small) and fit sloppy on me.  I like a tight fit.  I am returning that one, but I am keeping the other two.  The quality is great and the 3/4 sleeve is perfect.  Just beware that sizing may vary."
4.0,Beautiful purse but arrived without a strap.
4.0,"Fits great, comfortable too! I really like it!"
4.0,"Cute. Got as a gift for a friend who was turning 9. They don’t look the highest quality and just come in a little bag, but I put them in a little box with the jewelry padding and the presentation made them look a lot nicer. I kept some of the pairs and have worn them myself and have seen her wearing them too."
4.0,Love this shirt but runs a size too small. I would suggest buying the next size bigger
4.0,Pretty good / looks good/
4.0,I get compliments on this set.
4.0,Arrived as expected. But was missing the extra item.
4.0,"Based on the other reviews stating this dress runs small I ordered a large.  This dress runs true to size and is actually a pretty nice, comfortable material.  The only problem was they sent the wrong pattern dress but I will just keep it since my honeymoon is in 2 days.  I am 5'7 and the length is also nice.  It hits about mid thigh and is not sheer at all so it can definitely be worn as a dress.  Other than the company sending the wrong print, I am very happy with the dress!! Good value"
4.0,Granddaughter loved the dress but one of the buttons fell off the first day she wore it.
4.0,"The blouse itself is lovely and I the color is a beautiful chocolate brown. It is a bit too large in the shoulders, however, it is always difficult to order blouses as I need lots of space in the chest area and every blouse fits differently. But I rather have it too large than to small."
4.0,good socks for the price
4.0,"This one is slightly smaller than the previous one i purchased. Still love it, even if I have to squeeze into it."
4.0,"I'm 5'5&#34; 130 pounds, and a medium is definitely big on me. It looks ok if I belt it just right, but I wish I had bought a small. It seems like good quality. The fabric is a little bit thick, not sheer at all."
4.0,"These are great! They're the right thickness I was after (I'm dealing with temps between 40 and 55 degrees F) and work pretty well.  The index finger on my right hand (the one I use the most) *kinda* lost it's &#34;power&#34; after a while, so sometimes it takes two swipes to get it to kick in, but overall I'm pretty satisfied."
4.0,The suit was nice but the belt arrived with thread already coming apart. Only complaint is on how difficult it is to zip up or down. Not easy to go to the restroom without being helped to unzip.
4.0,Center rhinestones keep falling out. I am going to use e6000 glue to make them stick.
4.0,"Good shoes, but fit is a bit tight where some people's feed might be wide."
4.0,"does the trick ,light weight"
4.0,Will be looking for more options of this type of pin.
4.0,"Beautiful color. A little smaller than I thought it would be even though it says mini satchel.  I think that the person I bought it for will like it and there are some events that she just needs something to carry her phone, credit cards, keys  and money in and it seems big enough to hold all of that."
4.0,Should have bought a size bigger
4.0,"Wife likes it, a bit thin on material but fits perfect."
4.0,I like this one and use it often. The only thing I think it needs is a small design tweak on the collar and sleeves to allow it to be invisible under a t-shirt. Not a deal breaker but you can see the sleeves and some of the neck stick out from under a t-shirt. Not an issue with a button down.
4.0,It's made from very thin material but it's still a nice sweatshirt dress. It was a little longer than the picture but still fit pretty well.
4.0,This is a great shirt....my mom loved it! We don't find many shirts with 'Grams' on them....she thought it was very special!
4.0,"Good for the price.  It's 100% Polyester so don't expect this to wick away moisture and keep you dry.  If that's not a deal breaker for you, then I say get it.  Anything that's made of 100% polyester will last you forever.  I took a star away because although the large fit me, the forearms fit way too tight - almost like they're made for a girl."
4.0,These socks are super cute and very versatile. I wear between an 8 1/2 to a 9 and I find the fit a bit snug but not unmanageable. I've also put them through the wash a few times already with no special treatment and they have held up so far. I would purchase these again.
4.0,the arm holes were tiny. I have thin arms and the dress fit everywhere else. odd proportions
4.0,"Love this outfit, I think I purchased 0-3 and she is 3 weeks old and it fits perfect. And the outfit is adorable 💕"
4.0,"Love the ring and the color. I saw the new black ring and its a must get ring. I wish they had more colors because I would want to get a red, green, or yellow."
4.0,The socks were a little smaller than i expected but they fit just fine.  Great price for the number of pairs of socks i received.
4.0,Yes. I wanted the boot in black but got blue instead. I will have to settle for the blue I guess.
4.0,Nice shoe but color was too dull and faded. Some suede polish and they were lovely. Now my husbands favourite sneaker.
4.0,"Very cute, and the price was excellent!"
4.0,Nice but sizing is off -- by at least a bra size (36 feels like a 34)
4.0,I just received my wallet. I can't comment on the rfid properties because I haven't had it long enough yet but so far I like it. Only thing I will say is it does not look exactly like the picture the leopard print is a little more muted than the photo but i wanted the leopard print so I still like it I just wish it was as bright as the photo. Overall I am happy with my purchase. I will probably be purchasing a new one when the old one wears out :)
4.0,Good quality and looks great. The clips for connecting to the watch are loose so it makes a little noise during any activity.
4.0,"We just opened this today so this is out of the package. It seems to be nice quality polyester and way better than most costumes with that odd fabric that’s easily ripped. I can’t speak to longevity yet during wear but I’ll try to update after it’s been worn a bit.<br />FOR SIZING REFERENCE: my girl is 4.5 yrs old, about 36 pounds, and 42.5” tall I believe. I got the SMALLEST SIZE possible and it is a few inches large at the waist. It still looks cute though! I plan to pin it for Halloween at the waist and let her play for years to come!<br />PROS: better quality than most costumes.<br />  Zipper rather than velcro!<br />  Fast shipping<br />  Includes crown and petticoat<br />CONS: (so far) petticoat seems a bit short and falls<br />  Off a bit. I may add Velcro to help this. It’s<br />  Currently tied with a shoe string as it comes.<br />  Big at waist (not necessarily bad)<br />  Description says to hand wash (😒)<br />Biggest note is that she LOVES IT and that’s most important part!"
4.0,"Colorful straps make it easy to see your luggage coming. Bright colors, look sturdy, good value to get 4 for the price"
4.0,Decent fabric and material.
4.0,Fit my glasses perfectly. Only thing is it is too dark and I actually have trouble seeing if the sky is not completely blue and sun is shining bright. Maybe the gray will be better.
4.0,"Well worth the money, they look very real I get compliments on them every time I wear them, I love them."
4.0,Por favor me podrían decir el largo  del vestido soy<br /> 5'1. Me gustan largos no dice la medida del largo.  Gracias 🙂
4.0,"Approximate measurements unstretched:<br />Underarm to underarm - 17&#34;<br />Shoulder seam to hem - 31&#34;<br />Across hem - 33&#34;<br />Waist tie - 60&#34;<br /><br />I purchased the wine red in &#34;one size&#34;. I typically wear a size M to L, 36C bra size, and this top fit really well. I'd say it was about a women's size Large without stretching. The listing says modal spandex and the fabric feels basically the same as rayon spandex blend, similar to the fabric of stretch maxi skirts. Recommend a cold wash and no dryer as this style fabric typically shrinks. It's a nice quality material which was not see through. The arm holes fit me a little differently to the picture as they curved inwards a little like a slight racer back style but in the front. It was long enough to cover my butt and upper thighs so it can be worn with leggings. It was loose fitting but certainly not oversized or sloppy looking. The waist tie was long enough for me, I wear a size 10 jeans, but it made me look dumpy. I paid about $5 with free Prime shipping and it was definitely worth the price."
4.0,I love the color and the concealing compartment.
4.0,Performs and holds what I need. Holding up so far but its not real leather.
4.0,"I have many pairs of no-show socks that are thicker and I like them because they’re cushy but there are some shoes that are more snug so these socks are perfect them.  They have three gel-like strips on the inside of the back of the heels to keep them from slipping into the shoe.  They seem to work well but not sure if they will stand the test of time. I’ll update if there are any issues down the road, but at this point I think they are comfortable and worth giving them a try."
4.0,"This is a cute dress. However, it is not the least bit formfitting as the picture would suggest. It is also very thin."
4.0,"Cute sweater, however, it doesn't hang off the shoulder as well as the pic shows. I stretched the sweater to widen the neckline and tore it. It's kinda cute. It's definitely off the shoulder now. Just looks a bit worn. Even though I've worn it once. Lol"
4.0,Bag was as described and very nice quality. Th e only reason I rated four stars was due to the metal on the bag. They could have left it off. Other than that the bag is very nice.
4.0,The waist is REALLY tiny...and I'm not usually in denial about those things.
4.0,They are beautiful but rather small. My daughter liked them.
4.0,Does the job was not able to completely remove the worst stain but did minimize it; wish I had purchased on same day I bought my wife's boots.
4.0,The inside is so soft and cozy and it's not too lightweight but not too heavy either.
4.0,"This dress is so flattering! The cut is cute and the material is softer than I expected. However, i ordered the black floral but received the blue floral."
4.0,"Hats seem to be all the rage lately. For me, though, it's not about fashion as much as it's about practicality. I am a gardener and sometimes I'm outside for quite a long time. I hate the feeling of the sun beating down on my neck. I have one hat that's more rigid and is slightly bigger than my head. It flies off when a good gust of wind hits it, which defeats the purpose.<br /><br />I had the opportunity to purchase this hat at a discount in order to provide an honest review of it.<br /><br />This is my review-- it's really cute and not very rigid. I suppose one could say that the material is cheaper, which could be the case, but it's better for me because it's snug on my head without the need for anything around my chin which annoys the heck out of me.  It stayed put in the wind, although the wind was just regular wind at the time.  The ribbon around the head part is permanent, so it's not like you can re-tie it or anything. It gets smushed during travel, so you might need to re-form that ribbon.<br /><br />The brim of the hat isn't moldable, it's just sort of slightly floppy. I like that it's not too wide, either, because I don't like gaudy. Overall I think it's a great hat for a good price."
4.0,"I have really sensitive ears and I wore these for an hour and only took them off so I could exercise. They are REALLLLY magnetic or whatever you call it, so this will probably work for you if you have thick ear lobes. Definitely recommend!"
4.0,Fits as expected but could be a little taller.
4.0,One of them did not come with the TRS lock on it.
4.0,"I have not worn them yet but I love them. The color is vibrant, true to picture and I'm looking forward to wearing them."
4.0,"Like the fit , but could of been packaged different"
4.0,Mask is very comfortable the thickness is nice
4.0,He faces are a little hard to see but it is pretty good overall. The quality of the metal is very nice and great for the price
4.0,Wore them for a round of golf and my legs felt better.  Would give them 5 stars but the zipper on one sock comes down
4.0,"Basic tee shirt, a little bit boxy.  Fits as expected."
4.0,Sadly my package arrived with a missing pair. Had to ask for a refund. But the pairs it did come with looked really nice. I'll give a four star rating for packaging and quality but not the full five cuz I was missing that pair.
4.0,Lovely just a little big. I have small wrists.I usually have to order a 6 cm
4.0,"The socks are ok, nothing special but so far so good, hard to say until they wear out, 5 stars. But talk about excessive packaging, Every.Single.Sock.Had.To.Be.Cut.Twice.With.Tiny.Scissors, lose 2 stars! If you have long hair cats the socks come out of the dryer without any fur stuck to them, +1 star!"
4.0,"Top fits perfectly, very flattering. The bottom shows the inner white liner a little so I have to adjust it constantly. But looks great."
4.0,"Sturdy in construction, and beautifully detailed. A must have for that Wonder Woman fan in your life."
4.0,Hard to get exact size for my son when he can’t try on
4.0,Cute design and warm. Great for gifts. They have some loose threads in the inside and they are not that tall on the leg.
4.0,"The quality and the printing on the sweatshirt are great, it does run a little large."
4.0,"I have wanted to test out &#34;midi rings&#34; for a while, but wasn't willing to shell out $10 for the ones I saw at the store. I saw these on Amazon and thought they would be a cheap way to test them out. The rings came pretty fast and are very pretty.<br />However, there are things you should know before purchasing:<br />- They're all the same size<br />- They're all pretty big. (They fit on my ring finger like a regular ring (so they're all size 7).<br />I can still wear the rings on my middle fingers, so I am pretty content with my purchase.<br />Definitely worth the few dollars that I spent on these rings."
4.0,"Well made dress, lace is nice and not too low cut! Comfy!<br />No boob support though. Need to wear a bra!"
4.0,"Look great and stretchy, but way too small.  Ordered XL according to the chart, but the label says XL for CN and says M for US sizing."
4.0,"Thicker than I expected, but also stay on my feet."
4.0,"These are very pretty and I love they way they looked. while they do have silicone at the heel, I still found them slipping off in some shows. They tended to work best in flats that has a low side and heel, anything taller and they bunched up in the shoe. I am a size 8.5 and these are a little bit too snug. If you are a size 9 and higher in US womens', these are not for you."
4.0,The shirt run a little bit small but the outfit is just as pictured.  Very cute
4.0,"Really like these and would recommend. Wish the inside didn’t shed, but it isn’t too bad. They are very soft, warm and comfortable"
4.0,"These fit far better than I expected and do stay up over the course of the day. My feet are wide, so I feel like these are a smidge too small for my size-9 feet and my toes get smushed, but I do like them and would order again."
4.0,(Reviewed by my wife): These little sapphire earrings are lovely.  They are elegant and nice quality.  They go with just about anything - you can wear them with a casual outfit or dressy outfit.  The earrings come in a gift box and are definitely giftable.
4.0,Love the graphics and the fabric.
4.0,Beautiful dress got a size small which was still a tad bit loose.
4.0,These are very good products. I Like them. And will use again.
4.0,I received the light blue pandora bracelet today very nice a little heavy but is pretty great for a gift.
4.0,"I am 5'-4&#34; tall and weigh about 120 pounds. I typically wear a US size 2 or a juniors small/medium in similar styles at retailers like Forever21. I ordered this dress in a size Large based on the sellers sizing chart provided in the photos. The Large fit's well. It hits mid-thigh and provides adequate coverage in the chest. I would feel comfortable wearing this dress with leggings or a blazer for work in a corporate environment.<br /><br />The material is a stretchy cotton blend. The seams and hems are well constructed. They are smooth and comfortable against the akin. The material is easy care and washes easily. The large fits me well so I will probably avoid drying this dress to avoid any shrinking of the material.<br /><br />Overall, this is a cute style that is relatively up to date yet classic. This dress is reasonably priced and ships quickly since it is Prime eligible. It would make a great gift for yourself or the young professional in your life.<br /><br />I hope you found this review helpful. If so, I'd appreciate you clicking the &#34;helpful&#34; button!"
4.0,The bands are durable and pretty. A little hard getting into Fitbit watch. Figured out they have to be put on with the back of the band towards you and the watch back towards you because of the way the pins are. After figuring that out it wasn’t difficult.
4.0,I love Ethika and the quality of their products but this bra runs a tad bit small so if you're as big or bigger than a D get a size up (I wear a 36DD and the large I ordered is very small)
4.0,"Fit perfectly, feel great. I wear them all the time with no issues or problems. Only reason this isnt 5 stars is my bf had to take pliers to one of them to twist the end off."
4.0,Showed a little bit of my nose because of how short it was but I didn't want a huge mask so it looked fine to me and I got exactly what I expected.
4.0,"They fit true to size and feel quite comfortably.  I do wish they had front pockets, not just decorative pocket-looking stitching.  Sale pricing was good value."
4.0,"the 3X turns out to be the right fit for my 46"" 38DDD bust. the fabric is very stretchy both ways and has a microfiber feel, not slick and shiny.  thankfully, this dress doesn't barrel out at hips as much as it appears to in pics.  at 5'4"", I do have to hem it up about 6"" so that I can walk in it, way too long. and the pockets - a nuisance!  bulge way out, ball up, and turn themselves inside out ruining the line of the dress.  luckily it is roomy enough that I can sew the sideseams in to cut those miserable pockets clear out.  bottom line, requires sewing skills to make this dress fit and flatter, unless you are 5'9 or taller and appreciate/need pockets."
4.0,not bad at all comfortable and relaxed fit
4.0,This was the third Maxi Dress I ordered of this type and brand.  I order two solid color dresses as well. The fabric in this one was much liner and sheerer. Way more stretchablity. I liked the solid ones better.
4.0,This top is so soft and comfy! for the most part it fits as expected except there is lots of exra fabric on the shoulders creating a kind of pointy effect any time you try and move your arms.
4.0,"Jacket fits well overall. Construction seems good! Sleeves needed to be shortened, and didn't fit well with my tummy. With some minor alterations it will be fine."
4.0,"So my normal size is 8/medium in ladies and i was told to size up so i got a large. well its definitely to big. i ordered a medium in another color since they didn't have the color i wanted to see if medium fits better. I received it and it fits perfect. It is a lol clingy in the belly area but i still love it. I got a dark red/maroon color and it is true red, it's very red, not dark like i wanted and ordered.  i absolutely love the top its long and covers what needs to be covered while wearing leggings. i say they are true to size so order your size. it does tend to cling to you more then id like but its very cute!! Yellow was spot on with color."
4.0,"Tight around the breast area, but do love the lightness and the sleeves."
4.0,"I got this to stretch the waist on a pair of very heavy 25oz Japanese jeans. And it works as advertised. I feel like the machining on the coupling bolt could be a little cleaner, and the wooden pieces would be better if they were at least twice as thick.<br /><br />But I am impressed that it was able to hold up against the waist of my crazy heavy Iron Heart Extra Heavy Selvedge jeans.<br /><br />Also it would be possible to make this yourself, but the price here is way cheaper than it would to aquire all the parts to DIY.<br /><br />I am thinking about buying a second one to use in tandem with the one I already have. I would buy it again."
4.0,"These fit well. I ordered size large. I am 5’3” and 185 pounds. I wanted compression. They have a high waist and stayed up when I did CrossFit. The legs did not roll.  I wish they were a little shorter but for the price, they are fine. The fabric is very cool and wicks sweat, which I love. Not 100% squat proof, but pretty opaque. The texture helped hide the little bit that showed through. Not the most attractive but they get the job done. I don’t care what I look like at the gym."
4.0,"These are cute sandals, but a little uncomfortable.  I'm going to have to break them in a bit in order to get the best feel from them.  As for the look, they are really quite cute and the gold color creates a bold statement to any outfit you pair them with.  The straps by your ankle stretch and they zip on your heel where the gold is a bright patent leather.  Overall, a cute sandal at a decent price!<br /><br />I'd like to thank Sandalup for allowing me to purchase this sandal at a promotional price so that I could share my honest opinion on their overall quality and comfort.  I will definitely be buying from Sandalup, again."
4.0,The elephant was a little smaller than I imagined - but the chain and elephant both are of great quality.
4.0,"The coloring makes it a little hard to read sometimes, honestly, and the hook is a little hard to maneuver  until you get used to it, but I had been eyeballing Nixon watches for months and when my boyfriend got me this, I was ecstatic. My favorite color and so classy and simple."
4.0,"It came quickly and it fits well, the material is thin and the hem is cheap but if ur just wearing it out it is fine. I am really happy I purchased it."
4.0,"This product was easy to use, just a few sprays.  I am using it to stretch a pair of leather penny loafers.  Not quite there yet but it iWorthwhiles working."
4.0,"I don't know if it fits me or not. Washed it, my teen took it to wear, I've never been able to wear it."
4.0,This dress is absolutely beautiful. I got many compliments and felt very sexy. I gave it a 4 because of the thinness. It shows all of your curves good and bad. I am 5'3 and about 125lbs.
4.0,Enjoyed by tween boy.  Wish it were a bit longer.  Very soft.  He especially likes the hood.
4.0,I loved tge blouse the material was thick the sewing was neat. The style isfab. The fit runs way too small.
4.0,"I got these today and they are pretty earrings.  The clasp on one of them was very tight and would not open to put it in my ear, so my husband opened it up for me.  If you have tiny holes in your ears don't get these because the post is very wide I had to force them in my ears so I won't be wearing them much."
4.0,"somewhat snug, but it fits. Will need to have a jacket over it as it is form fitting and I don't particularly want to share my lush figure with the world. :) Love the lace."
4.0,"It's ok. I honestly don't believe it's made for naturally curvaceous women. It smashes in your butt and doesn't lift it. It gets oddly tight around the hips (where thighs naturally spread, and it was to big around the waist.<br /><br /> However, the material is nice."
4.0,Need to break in gloves.
4.0,They are cute and comfortable but slightly too wide for me. I fell because foot slipped around shoe. Will save for cooler weather to wear with socks.
4.0,Perfect size for a man's necklace.
4.0,Everything was great but the case came with a big crack so only 4 stars. I don't plan on returning it i really like them
4.0,Great casual dress
4.0,"Looks great, but feels a bit too chunky/rigid."
4.0,the headline is not my dating profile it is the perfect description for these earrings
4.0,"I like this dress very much, for not having much shape it creates a long lean silhouette."
4.0,"I was looking for myself a beach hat was excited when I found one that had a ponytail holder. I like that there is an option to adjust to fit your head. My daughter can wear too. The strap is good for when we ride bikes so that hat does blow off. The hat came folded and the only reason for taking off a star. It did leave some creases that I tried to iron out. It helped some. I bought my daughters the same style from a different seller and they were mailed flat and didn't have the creases. Overall, I would highly recommend this hat. I get compliments on the ponytail feature."
4.0,I like the shirt but it runs small
4.0,"Beware of loose threads. I bought 20 of these t-shirts in various colors.<br />They look and feel great. They are a little bit delicate because I noticed if you fold them<br />inside out most of the shirts I got had loose threads in the underarm area and the bottom of the shirt on the sides.<br />I guess their sewing machine isn't properly tying off the stitch. I found a little trick, but only if you are confident<br />not to burn your shirt....take a lighter and burn the end of the loose thread until right before it gets too close to the shirt,<br />I use my breath to blow it out right away and after that it will seal the stitch just like a good knot would. I don't recommend<br />this unless you have done this before with loose threads. But other that the loose thread problem the shirt looks very nice and tapers around me nicely."
4.0,Cheaply made but great for kids
4.0,Fits a bit small. Looks great!
4.0,Somewhat small but wearable....and the wind won't blow it off.  :-)
4.0,"very nice idea and printing, but the actual t shirts feel a little cheap.."
4.0,"Beautiful and great quality, however they fit a little big"
4.0,I liked this bag but it was a gift & the recipient didn't so I returned it. It was larger than I expected for those looking for a large satchel it is perfect.
4.0,"We bought this as a favor for my son's 6th spy bday party. I'd say at least 37 of the 40 worked. There might have been a few more that worked, but weren't very bright. But overall, great purchase! The kids had a great time with them!"
4.0,I love this bracelet and the only reason I didn't give it a five is because the little heart fell off  about 3 days of wearing it and I have no idea where. But it is still a nice bracelet and the poem is beautiful
4.0,Gorgeous key necklace!<br />I cannot give it 5 stars because my hair constantly gets caught in the chain.<br />I need to get a different chain because I'm literally cutting my hair off the chain when I remove it.
4.0,Only nitpick is the zipper is hard to zip sometimes. Other than that it’s perfect
4.0,"Good quality, durable. Son loves the lights. Easy to put on."
4.0,One of my go-to dresses to wear to my office.  I wish there was more color options other then mostly blue and white.
4.0,Product will accomplish what I need.
4.0,"Arrived in somewhat of a timely manner, looks great and feels great!"
4.0,"beautifully made dress exactly as expected from the pictures. I purchased this dress for my daughter's homecoming, and it arrived very quickly. The only issue the dress ran a little bigger than expected."
4.0,"I love this dress but I am not sure I'll keep it in this blush color. The bottom half is very sheer. I had to hold the dress away from my body in the pic so you couldn't see my skin under it. I was just going to wear nude shapewear but I'm afraid that would be visible as well. The sheerness may not be an issue with the darker colors. Also, size up at least 1 size for sure. Take your measurements and go off of the size chart vs ordering the size you typically wear. Amazon recommended my typical size but that would've been too small in this dress."
4.0,So far so good...a little more streamlined than 5.11. Not as good as quality though
4.0,"Nice shirts. Decent quality. Could be seen together better. Overall, I'm content with them."
4.0,"They worked perfectly for my Cruella costume, only thing is that they aren’t smartphone friendly."
4.0,Looks good<br />Not an everyday ring
4.0,"The dress is soft, the pockets wonderful and I love that it has vertical stripes instead of the usual horizontal stripes that don’t flatter anyone. What I did not expect is how far below the knee it falls. It will probably look better with heels but I can’t wear those at work."
4.0,"The mask arrived on schedule, but it was missing the plastic gem in front of the feathers, which exposed a lot glue. I ended up altering the mask anyway, taking off the feathers and adding some stick-on pearl halves. I tried cutting off the rise where the feathers (and where the gem would have been)to get rid of the glob of glue that wouldn't peel off, but it wasn't without consequence. Some of the glitter scraped off because of the scissors.<br />Overall, the mask is a comfortable fit and a great choice if you won't want to spend too much. I'm using the mask for a masquerade party a friend of mine is hosting, though I may try to incorporate it into my Halloween costume this year.<br /><br />I ordered my friend's mask (the same one) a few days later, and that mask was several days late but actually had the gem attached."
4.0,Very nice top. The only thing I don’t like is that I can’t tie the back tie myself. I have to get someone to tie it for me and that’s not always possible.
4.0,So cute and so stylish! even though the summer will be over soon it will be a great accessory for the fall.
4.0,"Fit well. Colors were consistent with pictures.<br />It was easy to see all the colors and styles that were available to choose from. I like the fact that long sleeve, short sleeves, etc were all available to be seen from the same page. It made comparison and selection much easier. Wish sale pages were set up this way."
4.0,I bought these for my niece who will use them during her 1st Bday.  My brother and his wife were pleasantly surprised and happy to receive them and saying how they liked these on her.
4.0,"A little thin, but works well"
4.0,"I opted to wear this to an upscale wedding and received lots of compliments.<br /><br />However, the material can sure hold onto a wrinkle, although to be fair, besides the committed packaging folds my dress had a fair amount of extra wrinkles as it must have been a return & you need to be an origami master to get them back into the package!<br /><br />I opted to dry clean and when I picked it up he told me &#34;I ironed and ironed and ironed!&#34;  Poor guy, but better him than me!  It did iron out well, and at the end of the day I did wind up with a few &#34;committed&#34; wrinkles in the dress from how we were sitting, etc.  However, once it is ironed out, I think you're pretty good to go.<br /><br />The material is a nice cotton blend, and even with a petticoat added to give the skirt some extra flare I didn't feel like I was suffocating despite a very long, very hot, humid Chicago day and evening.  It still looked great at the end of the day!  During the (outdoor) cocktail hour a waiter dripped water from his serving tray across the whole front of my skirt because all of the drink glasses were sweating so much and I had momentary panic that I was going to look like a huge slob for the rest of the day...  Some material just doesn't do well with water spots.  Thankfully, while it took a little while to dry out because of the extreme humidity, once dry there was not a single mark on the dress.  So I'd give it 5 stars just for holding up to the environment.<br /><br />The color was a bit darker shade of purple than I expected, however, it was extremely complimentary to my skin tone & hair and I think it would look great on a variety of people.  I also ordered and returned the royal blue in a different size - the color seemed &#34;flat&#34; compared to the picture, and somehow that made if feel less dressy...  (Blue is my go-to color, but I personally think that the purple is a knock-out in comparison.)<br /><br />Depending on how busty you are (or if you're on the edge of one size to the next), you may need to secure the cross-over to make certain you're not &#34;showing off&#34;.<br /><br />Overall this is a really fun and comfortable dress that you could dress up or down.  The belt is not attached, so you could also swap that out for yet another look.  I think it is also a style that looks good on different body shapes and the high waist is definitely forgiving.  As far as petticoats, it really looks nice either way.  The dress has a nice drape without a petticoat, but if you want to complete &#34;the look&#34; it will kick it up a bit."
4.0,"I really like them, but the material is a little thin!"
4.0,Love the dress and fit.  It's a bit on the poofy side as far as the skirt goes.  And the pockets sit up a but high
4.0,"Pendant is very pretty, but chain is cheaper looking and not as dressy.  This is more of a casual wear item."
4.0,"I enjoy them, just wish the band around the waist stayed up better . I am always pulling them up"
4.0,"The Aquamarine Topaz is Beautiful, however the CHEAP chain is horrendous."
4.0,Good quality tie.  I wear it frequently.
4.0,"This bracelet is nice, but there are a couple of things you should know:<br /><br />Quality-wise, I can't complain. The beads are nicely crafted and well exceed what you might buy elsewhere. I will likely buy a 108 bead mala from Woodies.<br /><br />The finish on the wood beads could be better. One day out in Portland was enough to destroy the lacquer. This leaves you with dull wood beads, but they can be oiled up a little and since they are actual wood, they will come back to life. Again, quality.<br /><br />Lastly, the bracelet was a bit small on my male wrist. I can't fault Woodies for that.<br /><br />All in all, a good deal for what you're paying, but a better finish would be appreciated!"
4.0,"The design was bolder than I like, so I returned it.  And I wonder if the fabric would be hot in the summer?  I don't know the answer to that but something to think about."
4.0,"Nice coat, works as I was hoping. Fast shipping"
4.0,Decent set of shorts. The pad is sufficient for a 30-50 mile ride. I haven’t had the chance to go longer with them yet. They look sharp. I have noticed they may need a little more grip on the cuffs because they do tend to ride up a little higher than I’m used to but not excessively.
4.0,"really cute and nice but wish chain was longer, looks long in pic but when u get it --its not so long"
4.0,Great t shirt not see through true to size
4.0,Purchased as a gift for a friend/Product is as expected/Nice price
4.0,"There are 2 masks for under $14 at the time of this review which means they are reasonably priced. The fabric is synthetic but water resistant which I prefer to cotton masks which are more comfortable but water absorbent. I feel the water resistance is better for keeping out viruses. I put some drops of water on the mask and it beaded and after giving it a good hand wash it still beaded so water resistance is good. As described it does indeed appear to have 3 layers. The liner is a knit, again synthetic but it's not bad. Sewing is good. Included elastic bands are around 12 inches so pretty generous and you can tie to fit. My only con is there isn't a nose wire to make it seal tighter to the face but it is understandable given it's machine washable and a wire would probably squish in a washing machine. My head is on the small side and it fits me fine so thinking if you have a large head this might be on the small side but there are pictures uploaded with measuring tape so you can figure out of this will fit you. All masks do get warm and this one is no different but I found it tolerable. In the pictures it said the inner lining was antibacterial. I have no way to test this but antibacterial will not help again virus as it's not a bacteria but it will help protect against other things. I am depending more on the water resistance to help keep out virus contamination. I also don't imagine the antibacterial quality will last forever. Overall good mask and good value."
4.0,It fits good but if you are looking for A oversized one please size up 2 but the jacket is amazing
4.0,"I purchased the brown multi color. The actual color is different from the photo and is more reddish brown than the gray brown that is shown in the photo. That aside, the leg warmers fit just the way they do in the photo. they are soft, warm and won't fall down. Purchased for wearing over leggings for winter running."
4.0,Love the shirt I just wish it was sweat proof but overall good work out shirt. I own a blue and black.
4.0,Cute shirt. Just a bit too big. But i love the material. Comfy and great to wear when running errands
4.0,"These belts are cheap, evidenced by the price, but still look nice when on. There is a lot of stretch so it would fit a large variety of sizes (even plus!). I ended up folding mine in half, noting the middle, and slightly stretching it to give it a looser fit. Careful though, because when you stretch hard enough it stays that way! I needed an extra inch or two so the stretching had the desired results. The buckles themselves just hook together and the ornaments are large enough to be noticed, but not overwhelming. I can't speak to the longevity because I've only worn the leaf belt once, but I'd imagine I'll get enough wear out of them all. I don't think they would be good to actually hold up pants, they are decorative only.  Overall, they are cute, and good for the price of four belts."
4.0,"Ordered a rattan crossbody bag in Natural and received a Black one instead.  Disappointed...as I already have one, however, the quality was so much better than the black one that I have already I decided to keep it."
4.0,"I really do like these leggings, but my only complaint is how thin the material is. It shows my cellulite and my c-section scar like none other. The price is incredible for them but I do feel a little insecure in them which is my own issue. I would suggest going down a size. I'm typically a medium, but the small fits like a glove."
4.0,"I love the color, the fit was perfect  and it is surprisingly warm. On the down side, after only wearing it twice I did have to sew a button back on, I also had to sew the edge and interior of  the right  pocket because it came undone while I was wearing the coat.  I don't mind those issues very much because the price is perfect and it serves it's purpose very well. I am petite so the sleeves fit all the way down to my wrists."
4.0,"Is very soft and comfortable, I have been using it for a little while and it already has a hole on it. Is perfect, but quality is not the best."
4.0,It fits nicely and is comfortable.
4.0,Do not order up. Super comfy and pretty.
4.0,This dress was beautiful! I wore it to a wedding and the fit was great. It was very comfortable and not at all itchy like some lace sleeves can be. The navy is a little dark so I would perhaps recommend a different color so that the beautiful lace detailing of the top half is more noticeable. Lovely dress!
4.0,"Quality is very good, lightweight, and fits per the size."
4.0,"I like the style of this watch and it works well. I wear this a lot with my gold or white gold rings. They complement each other. So far there is no wearing of the watch surfaces, but I don't wear it every day."
4.0,Cute scarf for baby..stars are a little faded though
4.0,so far so good ! daughter loves it
4.0,"These are super cute! If you are looking for quality leather baby mocs, these are not it. They are definitely not leather, in fact the material is really not too soft (I've order two other pairs from this shop and they are much softer, so maybe it's this particular color of material that's stiff). However, for the price I'm really happy. These moccasins are pretty thick and I've noticed my baby's feet are sweaty after wearing, so these will be a winter shoe for us. They look great and I really like the elastic built into the top of the shoe. It makes them easy to put on and they do stay put. The color appears darker in real life, closer to black than silver. The tassels so not curve or stick up like other brands I've purchased, which I really like. As others have mentioned for this shop, they arrive taped in a plastic bag and do stink for about a day. The smell goes away quickly though. I've purchased these at a discount in exchange for an honest review. I will definitely recommend them to friends."
4.0,"This set was just what we needed for our family Halloween. Cheap quality, but worked for an evening of trick or treating, and we didn't want to spend more for just a costume. Bonus - most of the pieces have lasted for several months of dress-up play and are still holding up. Fit adults and kids in our family and looked cute."
4.0,Suns a little smaller in the chest than I’d like. I’m 36DDD and it barely stretches enough. The slot is also so high this would be a better swim suit cover up instead of a dress
4.0,I love them! If they were only a not that big that they keep falling off. I purchased two of these already.
4.0,Super cute but a Tad bigger than I wanted
4.0,Had to return as way too small for me.
4.0,It bends a bit if you hit it hard on a table but nice quality. The leaves catch on every thing. I wear mine as a thumb ring but on every thread and bag it catches.
4.0,"Very flattering, material sits well on the body.  Heavy enough to pull downward, and prevent gathering, but not too heavy that it makes it a heavy dress.  Good quality, nice fit.  it does stretch so it allows for comfort sitting but then goes back to its shape without wrinkling."
4.0,I ordered these for my 2nd piercing in the middle of my ear. They are super cute but pretty small. They don't climb the ear as far as I had hoped but still follow the ear enough I decided to try them. I did get them on and am wearing them comfortably. I did pinch the post to keep them in place and that does work for keeping them in place except if you wear them to sleep. So prepare to readjust or take them out at night. But for the money....cute small pair of crawlers. They're definitely different than wearing a stud so they'll take a little getting used to.
4.0,Fit was sonewhat small/tight but will work for what I need them to do. I did notice there was a small break/hole near one of the small finger areas but will not be noticed by anyone other than myself.
4.0,"Beautiful little trinket to share God’s peace. Smaller than expected, about the size of a nickel."
4.0,Beautiful watch. Lumin on it is nice
4.0,"Works great but battery started to conk out early, not holding a charge as well as my last one"
4.0,Fit is good. Bought a large to wear over shirts.. Quality wasn't as expected.
4.0,a little stiff but worked well.
4.0,really like what  i got great stuff
4.0,"These are the most comfortable underwear I've ever bought!  They are awesome.  The ONLY drawback is that maxi pads won't stick to the material so if you wear pads, don't buy these."
4.0,For $13 you can’t beat the quality and look. It’s super cute. The pants and shirt are so soft.
4.0,Love them they are alil too long tho.
4.0,"These Denim Garage Classics Men's Straight Leg Stretch Jeans are soft and comfortable. They do not feel like old-style polyester. They appear to run a bit large in the waist -- my pair has a 44-inch waist and is looser in the waist and thighs than the Nautica Big Easy jeans I typically buy at the same size. In fact, they're big enough that I won't be wearing them unless I gain weight, which is a bummer because they're otherwise good jeans. One quirk is that they have fewer than usual belt loops. This is not necessarily a problem. Also, the dyed-in wrinkles around the crotch are a silly fashion trend that hopefully will go away soon. Overall, they're not bad."
4.0,"I recently bought this for my winter vacation. I loved it! It was perfect for me to wear on the plane and keep my id, credit card, and phone in for easy access during check-in/ security and comfortable to keep on during my plane ride! I almost forgot it was on. It was perfect for the day in the Disney parks to hold my essentials!"
4.0,Smaller then I thought but cute for small necklaces
4.0,For the price they were nice. Really tall not as thick as I wanted.
4.0,"Really nice holders, good quality but could be a bit longer."
4.0,"These masks are very cute, but too thin to be worn for protection"
4.0,They are beautiful for this order it was great but I also ordered 4 more  that I have already received  but 1 of them wasn't the same earring.
4.0,"Solid helmet.  A bit snug, and sound proof."
4.0,"Super cute, warm and comfy! The only downfall is the threading is coming undone on the very bottom where the sole is sewn, whaaaaa! If it weren't for that, it would have been a perfect 5 stars."
4.0,"This dress was much longer than I expected, but I kept it because I’m sure I can can use it on some occasion. Niceaterial."
4.0,"This dress is so cute! Love the print, material and the fit. Unfortunately it was defective .. no hole to pass the right tie through and the tie is sewn in the wrong spot . Seller sending me a replacement .. I just hope it arrives in time for my trip !"
4.0,When I bought this I read the reviews before hand and knew that the chain would be long instead of choker style. But when I ordered it the chains were silver but they came in brown
4.0,"I received a necklace that I purchased for my mom's birthday and was pleased to get it on time, and intact. It looked exactly like I had seen it on the preview and it was very lightweight. The only disappointing thing was the chain; the chain is too small to put on anyone's neck unless they're an infant. That is the only thing that disappointed me, because I was aware of an 18"" in diameter, and it was about 5"" in diameter."
4.0,Love it show the faith
4.0,Really great value for the price. Wish I would have gotten a size smaller but it’s still great!
4.0,"I love this messenger bag - it's got lots of little compartments, it looks good and it's comfortable.  The build quality is excellent.<br /><br />The Surface Pro 3 does fit snugly inside, but it seems just a hair too short - it'll fit under the elastic strap that holds the tablet in place just fine, but it's so short on space that if have the pen attached to the pen loop on the keyboard, you won't be able to comfortably close the bag.  I keep my pen in the bag's pen holder instead, and that works fine.<br /><br />With the tablet, power supply and headphones in the bag, there isn't much other space before it starts bulging.  Adding a small wireless mouse is alright, but my Rubik's cube definitely won't fit.  It's basically meant for the Surface, power supply and a few papers, and even then the space consumed is mostly padding."
4.0,My son loved it. Quality of the clothes is good. The crown is not super fancy but is good enough for photoshooting. Boots in the product photo were not included in package.
4.0,"Perfect for my wedding! Bouquet is 11"" height, handle is 6"" long, width of flower bouquet is about 8-9"" across. Love the crystal accents."
4.0,its what you expect for 10 dollars not bad
4.0,Nice leather.  Seems sturdy. Works for me!
4.0,Truly outstanding wallet.  Very soft with deep pockets.
4.0,Best available shoe online for youth cricketers in US at this price
4.0,Soft material. Not sure if it is linen.  Runs small. Overall cute looking. Nice color.
4.0,The sleeves for me were a little short but I still really liked the shirt.
4.0,"The price was great. Th dress is nice. It is cotton, which I did not expect. But, it is cute for a casual need. Probably not ready for dressy with this material. Good dress for the price though!"
4.0,This pullover was a little bigger than I expected but it had a nice oversized look so I wasn’t too upset. Definitely could have sized down. It’s definitely cozy and has a nice texture on the inside.
4.0,"Great fabric, super soft and stretchy. But definitely runs on the small side."
4.0,These gloves are so soft and great to wear with several different style clothing.
4.0,Much bigger than I thought.  I would have liked a more dainty piece of jewelry.
4.0,"I love them I bought them for my twins first mermaid birthday party. The star head band came broken I was able to fix it I figured it was broken due to the shipping, other then that I liked them and the price was great."
4.0,"Christmas gift, no complaints from the recipient"
4.0,"Too small, but worked for what we were using them for. Go up a size."
4.0,"Arrived as described, but was a little on the small size."
4.0,Happy with the purchase. I ordered one size up and they fit well.
4.0,"I like the fit, but they are kind of short on me so I could not wear them out and about. I am 5'6&#34; tall and 140 pounds and bought a small.  Very comfy.  Wish they were a bit longer."
4.0,"I like the concept, it is a little bulky and I had it less than a week and dropped it and the plastic insert broke but company was quick to address it and send me a replacement once they found out"
4.0,Good fit and comfortable. Would give five stars if there wasn't a logo on the front. I somehow missed that when i was buying them.  The logo is there when you zoom in. I probably would not have bought them.
4.0,These pants ... fit but a little to tight ... by the way I’m 4’11 pretty short ... I weigh 140 so I bought these and they fit but suggested to go a size up .... I bought a size 7 and it fits but a little tight
4.0,not as I expected the sizes are too large
4.0,Great socks...feet feel great
4.0,My granddaughter loves these! The adults love the ankle strap so they're more secure on her feet. Fast shipping.
4.0,Every one else likes it to. I have the britches. I guess I need to get the shirt.
4.0,My 17-year-old daughter squealed like a little girl when she pulled these out of her stocking.
4.0,"It's nice but pretty big. I usually wear a large so that's what I ordered, wow, I think I can fit another person in with me."
4.0,"It's a beautiful bracelet, I'm still trying to figure out how to get it to fit my wrist the best it can."
4.0,these shoes are beautiful but they are too small. I wear a size 8 but need a size 9 in these shoes which they don't have.
4.0,"I love this design so much I bought it in the pink, blue, and clear.<br />The first one I bought was the blue. I've had it for 2 months, do not take it out when I sleep/shower, and the body has started to tarnish.<br />You can see the difference between the blue one (2months of on/off wear) and pink one (brand new) in my photo.<br /><br />These clickers are very comfortable, don't fall out, but don't get stuck. I wish the ENTIRE thing was stainless steel so they would not tarnish, but besides that they are still really nice. Despite them not being 100% stainless steel, I would still buy them again. Like I said, they are comfortable and easy to wear.<br /><br />8/10 would recommend."
4.0,The earrings pictured are not the ones I received.  The last pair in stock was damaged. The seller offered me another pair and I accepted it.  I love them!  They were even prettier when seen in person.  I appreciated the effort made by the seller to satisfy my order.
4.0,"Purchased this for my daughter and it arrived in a timely manner.  This is made with good material and appears to be well constructed.  The lace has some stretch in it, to give that form fitted look.  The color is as bright as indicated in the photo.  Dress comes to just below the knees on a tall (5'8&#34;) female. There is a hidden zipper that runs from mid-back to above the bum.  The belt is attached to the front of the dress. Very pleased."
4.0,"The fabric is a weird polyester which can snag easy but aside from that, it fits great and looks nice."
4.0,they claim they are 13-14 and they are still too small
4.0,"I like the white and gold color. The white stones are bumpy and more like rocks, which I wasn't expecting. It wear well."
4.0,"Fits great,looks nice,this does have a high neck line that I'm not use to but will wear any way because it looks great on me"
4.0,First off the print on model is different than print in picture of dress but I was aware I’d probably get the one that was different and it is very pretty! Second the dress is about 5 inches too long and a little wide. Keeping because my little can grow into.
4.0,Material is good and fitting properly.
4.0,Love the lace sleeve and the set fits well. Shorts are a little too short for my taste.
4.0,I thought these suspenders were a bit small at first but once I adjusted them they looked fine. I would consider the specially made ones if you don't want to damage your suits which these will over time. I use them on my less expensive pants and they look very nice...I plan on purchasing more of them in various colors.
4.0,"It's Very Cute. I wear this belt all the time with all of my dresses and skirts and it makes a perfect accessory. The only problem I have is after the first couple of times wearing it, it began to look I little stretched out after I took of the belt. Other than that it looks great. I'm glad I bought the product."
4.0,"The ear covers were a little weird to fit on the kids some times but other than that, they were super cute and warm."
4.0,"The dress is super long and needed hemming. Sleeves are also super long and I ended up cutting about 4 inches off. I am 5f 4i and ordered a medium. If you hope to have the under dress down on your shoulders (like i have in the picture) it won't stay (you have to keep pulling them down or add elastic to the arm). If you are not curvy, this dress adds curves and shape. Overall cute. The fabric is not breathable. Good for the price"
4.0,Great hat. Love the color. Live in FL and it has Great sun coverage especially for my neck. Will recommend to others
4.0,perfect for OT and for getting the wiggles out! Wonderful sensory item. I wish it was thicker and provided a safer stretch.
4.0,"These rings are great when doing anything that might damage my rings. Activities like hauling wood, swimming, running, working in the yard, etc. Fits well and the grooves keep your finger fresh."
4.0,"makes a grinding noise when you spin it, it's annoying."
4.0,"Now, I love my bookbag because of its huge storage space.<br />The problem is that the storage is mostly in one pocket. This solves the problem by arranging items in a flat, portable space that's very organized. It even has a small storage pocket on the back!<br />The only problem I've seen with this is that small, polished metal items (like a multitool) fall out.<br />Maybe I'll have to put metal items in there."
4.0,Rad  gladiators!  Total hit at the party.  Wore them for 5 hours comfortably.
4.0,My daughter has wore
4.0,Fits well; very light with mesh material. Just wish brim was same as a baseball cap. It's a bit long for my liking.
4.0,Nice watch. I'll let u know the quality in a few months.
4.0,Fits well. Material is kind of stiff
4.0,Love these but gave a 4 because they are priced a little high. You can buy a full sweat pant for the same price. Not too thick but you don't want thick for shorts in summer.
4.0,"Handy for fidgeters such as myself, it makes minimal noise, and for the most part, spins well. It does seem to get somewhat sticky at times, but it has always gone back to spinning easily."
4.0,"I got this for my daughter for finishing soccer season strong and she loves it. It has a cute pattern in it and it's sturdy, however she made a mistake and broke the chain, but it was a breeze to put back together. This is one of her favorite gifts from us."
4.0,"These definitely run large. Since the sizing is fairly ambiguous (S-L for a range of individual shoe sizes), I'm giving them a pass. However, based on reviews and the sizing given at face value, I bought a Large because I normally wear a shoe size 9. These almost fall off my feet when I'm walking around. I bought them strictly to wear as ""house shoes"" at my boyfriend's place where I don't necessarily like to walk in my bare feet or even socks, so overall they serve my purposes well. They are SUPER soft and pretty cute (if they didn't look so oversized--very wide as well). I do not regret my purchase. I would not recommend wearing outside the house, however."
4.0,Very see through u will want a white or nude bra
4.0,"The price for this skirt can’t be beat and the quality is that of $50 skirts I have. Nice fabric and nice fit. I don’t like the silver wraps at the end of the waist tie, but I just cut them off."
4.0,"very good quality overall, but some of them are not looking as good as others. you gotta pick the nice ones if you're using in jewelery or gifts"
4.0,I like how thin this is! The only thing I dont like about it is the size is a little big. I recommend this if you have a big wallet!
4.0,"Love this ring...but my mother warned me ...tall oblong rings never sit right  on any finger..... she was right, it doesn't ....but I love it and stone is perfect! ❤️"
4.0,"Very nice ring, the stones sparkle beautifully and it's comfortable to wear, it does run a size smaller because the band is thick, i ordered a 9 but it fits like an 8, it goes very well with other stainless steel engagement rings that i bought, i'd recommend this ring to anyone looking for a wider band eternity ring"
4.0,"Very prompt delivery. The flares were a bit too big to fit to begin with, but I guaged just a little bit larger and managed to get them in the same day they arrived (lucky for me I have resiliant enough skin that I can gauge quickly w/out tearing). Love them!"
4.0,The product didn't look like it was brand new. Not too sure because the tag wasn't attached but was satisfied enough to keep it. Reason for the 4 stars. It also fit well.
4.0,"little smaller then I thought it would be, also shrunk after wash."
4.0,"Buena calidad, lindos diseños"
4.0,"The necklace is beautiful, the only thing I kept readjusting it throughout the day because it kept coming up to my neck. It did not hold up on the initial spot."
4.0,Great mask for the price just got it today would recommend it I use it for my magician acts and it's GREAT
4.0,If you have a big butt it’s not an ideal fit. They are suupper short. Like short enough I can’t wear them out or even to gym. Maybe just around the house. They are comfy and I like them just not respectable to wear around other people.
4.0,"nice bag, soft feel, lots of pockets"
4.0,Cute top. Has buttons running down the middle of ur back. Buttons are for show only. It wasn't what I ordered. Never got that. Top is long on me because I am petite..
4.0,"Bought these for my boyfriend based off his tennis shoe size. When he first put them on he said they were a bit small, but as he's worn them and they've become broken in, they are perfect fit and he loves them! He leaves them at my place and wishes he could have them at home too he's said."
4.0,"Was badly mashed when it got here, in box loose with a small other heavier item, badly packed., But I like the hat"
4.0,"I ordered these just to use in our In-ground Pool and they work fairly well. As I have a mustache and goatee the normal goggles that go over your nose settle on my facial hair and don't seal very well. With these goggles the bottom seal is on my cheeks and seals so much better.  I don't have a problem keeping water out of my nose so the above nose fit worked fine for me. The goggles were very easy to tighten and loosen up when you took them on and off. The also came with a pair of ear plugs and a nose plug that worked great if you decided to use them. The only complaint that I have is that when you are underwater that I had an issue where i couldn't properly focus. I could see everything clearly underwater, but my depth perception was off and it almost felt like I was looking cross eyed. I think it may have something to do with the curved nature of the goggles. I do wear reading glasses and thought it may be related to that, but I gave them to my son who has perfect vision and he experienced the same issue."
4.0,"These are a good quality shirt but HUGE. I usually wear a medium-large (34c, 5'10, 135lbs) and bought a medium in these. And they're very big. I wish they had worked, they're so soft!"
4.0,"This dress is very cute and versatile. The material is thin and flowy, but not see through.<br /><br />Overall nice fit and design. The only caveat is that this fabric wrinkles very easily. The dress arrived extremely wrinkled as well."
4.0,Bought this as a gift. They are beautiful & my BF really likes them. Reason for 4 stars is that the blue is a bright primary blue & not muted as I had hoped. The maroon color is very soft. The blue & white dominate. I do recommend these.
4.0,I love the look they feel very strong and I am going to get my prescription lenses put in hopefully that is possible. I am a fashion design student and these are an excellent addition to any woredrobe!!
4.0,They are good. I'm in between a 36 DD and DDD they fit good. Not super supportive though going to have to wear two of them till I get my breast reduction
4.0,"I'm not a wallet connoisseur. I am a utilitarian at heart and this wallet seems to have enough pockets and slots for my typical walleting use case. My previous wallet turned out to be a knock off leather wallet I bought off of eBay, but even then I begrudgingly used it anyways for almost 8 years before it tore in half.<br /><br />This wallet is nice, especially with the light grey tone I picked. It makes me feel sophisticated. Like, I feel like I have some offshore Cayman accounts whenever I crack this baby open.<br /><br />The driver license pouch is fairly easy to work with, and this is especially crucial due to my frequent run-ins with the law. The entire wallet seems to be lined with some sort of foil-like material covered in cloth. I'm not sure how good the RF blocking capabilities are, or how relevant this feature even is as the likelihood of someone getting close enough to your wallet to skim data via radio waves is... low, to say the least."
4.0,"DRESS IS REALLY PRETTY BUT SIZE RUNS SMALL. I WEAR SIZE 14, BOUGHT SIZE 16 BUT IT WAS STILL TOO SMALL SO I HAD TO RETURN."
4.0,These are awesome cross-trainers. Fit was perfect and they were a great deal.<br />Love these shoes 😍
4.0,Great looking in picture but the tight elastic waist band doesnt allow and wiggle room if you have a long torso....the shorts look like daisy dukes and the seam is in your no-no spot😳
4.0,The shirt is cute. Arrived quickly.  It was a bit short so I exchanged for one size up and that was a perfect fit. The one sided Cold shoulder is super cute.
4.0,A great watch for a low price. Leather band with 2 loops to keep everything straight. Large face with chrome on black dial makes it easy to read.
4.0,"I have purchased Spring Step shoes in the past and I love them. The colors in the leather is as pictured and shoes appear to be well made. I'm normally a size 41 which tends to be loose across the instep after a while (leather stretches). So I got a size 40 this time around which gave me a more snug fit, but was somewhat shorter in length. Don't think it's noticeable to anyone but me, nor will it make a big difference. I'm keeping them cause I love'm."
4.0,very nice easy to use.
4.0,"Ordered some other bikini tops, but none were as flattering as this on the girls! Make your boobs look great!"
4.0,Very cute! I want to buy more in different colors!
4.0,"This idea of camo scrubs sounds interesting, but when you put them on you feel like you're in the army - which is defninitely not what I want in scrubs...too bad!"
4.0,"I like the hat, but ordered the wrong size. I need to get a Large not XL."
4.0,It was a little hard to get the clasp undone but other than that kt was fine.
4.0,Great price. I wish it was a bit more shiny.
4.0,I purchased the blue hat and separate scarf for my 12 month old. It fit him when I received however that was in May. It's now Sept (yes I'm slow to write a review but thought this is when it counts fall is coming) I thought it was one piece but happy it was two. So soft and love the colors. So unique I know he will get lots of compliments. He's now 16 month's old and still a little warm out. I will post a picture when he wears it. I also believe he can wear it for a few more year's. It's very well made and lined. Stretchy in the correct way. Hope this helps. I gave a 4 because it said it would take 2 month's to ship. I received within 2 weeks but was unable to track it so had no idea when it would actually get here.<br /><br />Update: 10-20-16 we went out on a rainy day to pick pumpkins & apples. This hat and scarf were awesome and kept him (17 month old) warm and dry. He received many compliments and he didn't take either off which is amazing!
4.0,"only four, because they are too big to fit kids (Unless your kids have adults hands size)."
4.0,Great fit. Just was was described.
4.0,"I really love this jacket.  I get tons of compliments.  I purchased it in purple.  Please note  It is actually a more vibrant,  more fuschia purple than the photo shows.  It is on the small side as other reviewers mentioned.-  bought it with the expectation it would still be a fitted jacket when I slim down a bit.  I would be more comfortable in an XL,  but the L fits.  I think if the lining had any stretch to it,  the leather would  conform to shape-  & it would perfect now.  The sleeves are long,  and would be too long in an XL.  The leather appears to be of good quality-  It's not the utmost grade one could possibly purchase, hence 4 and not 5 stars,  but it definitely doesn't look cheap.  I'm glad I took the leap and purchased this!"
4.0,Very comfy but way too long. I’m 5’1 and had to roll these several times so they wouldn’t drag on the ground. I weigh 160lbs and wear a size 12 in pants. I ordered the XL and they fit perfectly.
4.0,Quality is OK. Sizing is small. The Towel needs to thicker. These robes are used by kids at the pool.<br />The belt loop at the back is missing. Need 3 loops minimum for kids robes.<br />Color was nice. Cloth is soft. Hood is great.<br />Size 10 (10yr) is more of size 8 (for 8 yr olds.)
4.0,SOOOOO COMFORTABLE.  HARD TO IRON BUT WORTH IT.  BE CAREFUL WHEN WASHING.  WILL BLEED ALL OVER YOUR OTHER CLOTHES.  HAD TO WASH IT BY HAND. EVERY TIME. I FINALLY SOAKED IT IN BLEACH  WHICH CHANGED THE COLOR BUT AT LEAST I CAN WASH IT WITH EVERYTHING ELSE NOW.
4.0,"Cute, i love it!  The shorts are very thin material.  I thought they would be sturdy and cargo like but they're not."
4.0,"the only thing I didn't know they were plastic , very cute but over priced for plastic def. not a daily shoe if you wanted to. they worked perfect for he special moment then I took them off ."
4.0,Ordered for my son for football camp... he sweats really bad and I didn't want him to get overheated....now it's all he wears
4.0,Great mirror look. Sometimes can see glasses behind them in sun light or various angles.<br /><br />Clip seems bulky but is sturdy and may or may not bother you.  Good alternative for when I dont want to put in my contacts but still need some shade or protection.
4.0,My experience with the sunglasses has been limited. But when I've worn them they are comfortable and do what sunglasses are supposed to do... block the sun.
4.0,"I love the dress and the print, but unfortunately I will be returning this particular dress because the fabric is not double sided."
4.0,"The bag is perfect but I was really looking forward to getting the cute little purse with it, and I didn’t.<br /><br />Would love if the seller would reach out and send me the purse."
4.0,These are very pretty in person. I got them engraved at a local Things Remembered Store and it looks gorgeous if I get a chance to post a pic I will.
4.0,"I have ordered it for halloween. I loved the fact that length is perfect and style is so cool. Lights works perfect as stated in the description. Overall, a nice tutu. I am really looking forward to wear it in upcoming Halloween Party."
4.0,"The socks were a weird throw-in, so I’ll leave that out. That hat is great quality, fits well enough and is very sharp. Holds up well to heat and sweat."
4.0,Cute but rubber near toes doesn't budge. A little snug for my 8 1/2 shoe size.
4.0,LOVE THIS PIECE IT IS VERY HEAVY AND STRONG ONLY REASON I GAVE FOUR STARS BECAUSE JUST A BIT TOO SHINY BUT OVERALL CUTE NECKLACE THAT LOOKS MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE THAN THIRTY BUCKS!!!  IM HAPPY WITH ALL OF MY LOLA FASHION ACCESSORIES
4.0,I was rather nervous to buy this based off some of the reviews but it fits perfectly!!! Only negative thing is that it smelled very chemically when I got it but I just washed it and it was good to go!
4.0,"I like the t shirt however, for an XL it fits rather snug (I usually wear a L but decided to go up a size) and still. It's comfortable, soft and color and print are exactly as described."
4.0,Works great. Needed this due to being allergic to the metal clasp.
4.0,Fits very nicely and it’s warm
4.0,Just as I expected love them
4.0,Love these hats I can wear my hair anyway I want with them
4.0,Overall pretty good. The bad...Lenses a little too dark for me...hard to see in medium light.
4.0,"I ordered this adorable outfit for my taller than average two year old.  I bought it in a Size 4.  Boy, it's quite large for a 4.  I put it on her and surprisingly, it fits and is too cute for words.  She looks like a sweet, little toddler model. :-)  The top is a soft sheer fabric and the shorts are somewhat like a thinner twill fabric.  This will be a great outfit to wear once the weather gets back into the 70's.  I'm glad it is a bit larger than I expected so that she can wear it for a few years to come.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I received this outfit at a reduced cost in exchange for my honest and unbiased review."
4.0,"I like the product, lightweight, and comfortable. I am typically between a large and x-large depending on the type of shirt. I ordered these in and XL and it's a little tight in the chest. If I ordered again I would go with a 2xl. Other than that great product."
4.0,Great purchase for swimming!
4.0,"Bought this for my grandson. Very cute! He was very excited, however it fit very snug. It runs small."
4.0,It worked perfectly for my Halloween costume but it smelled AWFUL. I put it outside to air out which helped but please be aware the smell is pretty strong chemical smell.
4.0,nice fake piece. its ok.
4.0,Very cute. Got a 4xl and I'm about an 18-20 sized. It fit very well just could have fit slightly better.
4.0,"I am really excited to wear this at work come fall and winter. My neck is always getting cold and tightening up. I work on an ambulance and multiple times a day I am exposed to the elements. I am always looking for neck things to wear in regs that will keep me warm but not burning UP! This will fit the bill. It will bundle up and keep me warm but not be so thick that I start sweating in the bottom of my hair. It feels very silky soft. Its pretty stretchy and returns to original shape easily. The inside is white however, so it might be black printed onto white fabric? I'm definitely looking forward to using it. Its almost like jersey knit."
4.0,It is the perfect size for me. I have not used it yet and if you don't hear back from me...it's perfect!
4.0,Sleeves are long..need to alter them..otherwise looks good..
4.0,This is a nice bag. It is light weight yet durable. Feels soft yet structured. The color (grey) is very neutral and versatile.  The only reason I am not giving it a 5 star rating is there are some finishes that are not spot on. With that said for the price it is worth it.
4.0,"Update:<br />these soft style shirts by Gildan seem to get softer the more you wash them, which was really one of the more important things to me. I ended up keeping one of the several I purchased to see if washing would help with the softness, and it has.<br />Something else to keep in mind that even though this is labeled as a womens cut, it is still more mens tshirt like fitting, but it’s shorter proportions so you’re not swimming in the sleeves and length. I think this would be perfect for someone leaning towards a mens tshirt style, but is short and, therefore, doesn’t have long arms or an extra long torso. What I do enjoy is that the sleeves are much shorter compared to the mens version, but still has good coverage like a mens cut, not like a lot of other womens cuts I’ve seen with uncomfortable sleeves with how short and tight they are - these are much better like a normal tshirt. I would still lean towards sizing up if you’re between sizes AND don’t like your clothes skin tight. I’ve weight, so the shirt fits me just how I like it now. I’m wearing a 2XL in this photo, but I am kind of between a true XL to 2XL, but I lean towards XL. So I wouldn’t go crazy with sizing up or anything, but lean larger I’d say if you like a looser tshirt feel. PLUS it seems to have the same neck line as a mens tshirt. Like I said, I generally don’t like womens cuts, so getting basically a mens shirt that fits well makes me happy. Fits so comfortably. I plan to buy more now that I know that it gets softer with washes.<br /><br />Original review:<br />This was not as soft as compared to another soft style shirt from this brand that I have. It really is a decent shirt, but I am crazy about soft material and it just didn’t compare. My other one is a mens style, so I am unsure if that has anything to do with that or not. I may try to wash it with my next several loads to see if it gets any softer. I had ordered a few of these same shirts and they all seemed not as soft as I was expecting. Still softer than a regular tshirt though. The womens sizing seemed a little snug and small. I don’t like my shirts tight so I will probably order a size up next time."
4.0,Came in today so I have not worn them yet.  Very good purchase. Would recommend them highly.
4.0,Don't stay very tight and the screws fall put easily. But hot style
4.0,These are really cute yoga shorts. They are very true to size and comfortable. As soon as I put them on my fiancé was a big fan. The only thing I didn’t like was the lines going down the back but that’s me being picky. Besides that I really like these!
4.0,"Dress is beautiful but top part definitely runs a little small. I'm usually a size 6, I ordered the 8 and I was barely able to zip it up.  Order one or two sizes up."
4.0,Love them but to small cause my lil guy has wide feet
4.0,"Nice weight & color, well made"
4.0,My granson luved it
4.0,If you have use those coconut earring the splinter in this ones are way bigger so be careful if you do not want to expand your ears too much. Lightweight and good design.
4.0,The dress is soft and easy to wear. The color is bright and eye catching. What more could you ask?
4.0,"I love that these pants were nice and long. I wish the waist was a little higher, but I am very high waisted. They were snug in the thighs and generous in the waist. They are super comfy!"
4.0,These do the job well for my weight lifting workouts! Open back keep you cool and the overall performance is great
4.0,"It is a polished looking piece, not rough. It is quite lovely, just as it appears in the photo."
4.0,"The jacket is nice.  Fits well and is warm.  Zipper seems a little cheap, but the more I wear it and use the zipper, it seems to be breaking in a little better.  Overall, for the money, it’s a good buy."
4.0,"The fit is perfect, looks pretty"
4.0,True to size. I’m not real fond of the shade of pink. Why? Because of the underlying pattern in the fabric and not simply dusty pink.
4.0,"It was ok. The black was not a true black fabric. The fit was ok, but not fitted like I thought it would be. I kept it anyway to wear at work."
4.0,fit well ..wear large n i bought the large fits perfect ...material kinda thin
4.0,"The dress is super cute and I like that this costume came with both the arm coverings and tights. It does run small making it a good costume for a tween or teen. My daughter is age 12 and 115 pounds.  She normally wears a kids size XL 14/16 or an adult small. And this dress fit her really well… but I don’t think it would fit the standard adult.  I had read other reviews that the wig was kind of strange. When you first put it on your head all the yarn hair is clumped in front. We took about 10 minutes to separate the yarn and lay it across the back of her head the way we wanted it, and then used bobby pins to secure it in place through the mesh cap.  There is a lot of yarn! We managed to hide most of the bobby pins even. See photos."
4.0,Just what I was looking for and such fast shipping
4.0,"Would give it 5 stars, but one zipper came without a placket and the strap on mine does slip down, winding up being very long most of the time.  Other than that, I do love it; washable, lightweight - and that’s important if you load it down with a lot of stuff like I do!<br /><br />As a Prime member, I buy a LOT of stuff from amazon.  Living out in a rural area far from a city, amazon is my go-to source for many of my purchases. I must rely heavily on your product reviews to help me decide which item is best for me -- especially when I can't actually see, touch or hold the product.<br /><br />I take my personal product reviews seriously, and if something proves to be a piece of junk, I'll tell you - and if it's great or mediocre, I'll tell you that, too.  My policy is to try to write the kind of reviews I want to read and to update my reviews if for some reason the product fails to perform as advertised during the period it's warrantied for. I do ask that if you found this review helpful in making your decision, that you please click on the ""yes"" button below."
4.0,"I just got my watch as a gift and after following the directions several times, I found it synched to the correct time within a half hour.  It has a nice clear display, when I hold my wrist just right, however, I hope I can get the watchband replaced with twist-flex band so I can re-position it on my wrist to see it better.<br /><br />The two things that bring the rating down by a point include the fact that it doesn't have a second hand and it displays the date military style -- August 10th displays as &#34;10-8&#34; and it doesn't display the year.  But it does display the day of the week, and that's nice. After a few days, the display changed so that the month showed first, so by August 12th, the display showed &#34;8-12&#34;, which is the way I prefer.<br /><br />I just realized that even if I replace the watchband with a silver band, there's still a border inside the watch that is pink, so there will always be pink on the face of the watch.  But, I think the convenience of a self-setting watch is worth that inconvenience.<br /><br />Maybe some day they'll develop an atomic watch that is narrower, more like a woman's watch."
4.0,Work well - basic buckle band
4.0,"Had to leave a star off on account of there being no side pockets. Looks good, fits good though."
4.0,"The material is great. Compared to a similar one I purchased, not by the same company, but a monokini, this item was put together very well. Under the front skirt, the bottoms are secured at the top of their band to the liner. This helps the suit lie smoothly. The suit has enough give in it, but supports well. I do not think it is made for longer torso's though, as the bra elastic fell about two to three inches below my breasts and the straps fell off my shoulders. I wear a 14/16 in clothes, but thought, from my last experience, a 16/18 would fit. Unfortunately it did not. I'm a C cup and it felt strange to have the elastic strap so low, and I couldn't pull it up. Yet, the shoulder straps slipped off.<br /><br />Overall, I really liked the design, and the fabric, and the way the skirt draped in the front.<br /><br />I received this item at a discount for my unbiased and honest review."
4.0,Got for my daughter she love it ..
4.0,"*** NOTE: I received a free sample of this product in exchange for an honest review. ***<br /><br />The Beipei Women's V-Neck Tunic Top is a nice soft blouse with an appealing shape and fit.  The large elastic waist does a good job of snugging up next to your skin while accenting your top and not your hips.  The material is very soft and the blouse color that I got (purple) was very dark and vibrantly colored.  The only negative comment my wife had was that the V-Neck line was a little too low for her as it was revealing her bra from time to time as she shifted.  She typically wears a tank top under her dress shirts though so it isn't an issue for her.<br /><br />Overall, we really liked the Beipei Women's V-Neck Tunic Top.  The material was soft and silky and the blouse fit and looked great!"
4.0,"No question.  These are definitely leather.  They are pretty, true to size and classy.  I do not have eight more words."
4.0,Fit was good - the only thing I don’t love is the pockets stick out a bit.
4.0,Still going to try and wear it on the beach... If it doesn't work out all that great in the water I can always wear it as a body suit with a skirt or something.
4.0,"Cute dress. I received this item within the promised shipping time and that is a plus. I ordered a medium which is usually the size that I ordered for everything and it fit it perfectly. The material is pretty nice and soft, so I like it. The one thing that i do not like about this dress is the lenght. This dress is too short! From the picture I was expecting this dress to be a little bit longer....l personally did not want a dress this short but I will keep it to wear it around the house and to go to the swimming pool when it get a little warmer. The colors of the dress are beautiful just like in the picture and the dress still perfect after I washed it. If you are looking for a cute short dress, this one will definitely do it. The dress looks great with my cowboys boots but I am sure it can be wore with different items as well."
4.0,Dress was absolutely perfect- only issue I had was dress was slightly see through lining needed to be added.
4.0,Feditch Women's Comfy Drawstring Casual Elastic Waist Pocketed Summer Shorts<br /><br />Shorts wrinkle easy and are quite short. The waist is elastic but also has a functional drawstring. Two side pockets and two patch pockets on the back. The shorts are not very flattering on me. A bit too short and boxy. Also they seem to crawl up the hiney no matter what size. I'm 5'6 and 130 lbs and I ordered a pair of small and large - both pairs look like they are crawling up in the back. Totally not a good look for me. 4 Stars. Hope you find this review and pictures helpful.
4.0,"I love the pants and they fit perfectly but the shirt is too big.  I wear 32 jeans so I needed an XL bottom but a medium top.  I wish I could have ordered different sizes but it isnt allowed.  Also, I would wear the bottom with a white tank top and the top with jeans...not together."
4.0,"Easy to put on, they just don't last long, you have to put new ones on every so often."
4.0,Big but still useful for what I need it for
4.0,Fits a little small but is still comfortable
4.0,"This hoodie is great, its comfortable however it streches out so easily it becomes kind of baggy.<br /><br />If youre looking for something with a stronget structure id look elsewhere but for a lazy just chilling out at home or running errands its perfect."
4.0,Loved the look of this watch but couldn't get the band apart to tighten it.
4.0,"I really was surprised by the quality of such and inexpensive swim suit.  It has a liner in the front and the material is not see thru, it's legit material.  Only problem I really had was that the torso was a bit short, but my hubby didn't mind.  I'd prefer it to come higher on the bust tho.  I'm 5'5 175 and a ordered a XXXL I usually wear a size 12"
4.0,Very nice and actually work! Great for formal camping! or escaping a 5 Star POW camp!
4.0,I love the color change from dark at the bottom to lighter at the top. The two colors complement each other. The shape and style are perfect. It is comfortable to slip on any time of the day.
4.0,"nice bag, a bit tricky that the top flips over, often my phone then slips out..."
4.0,"I think this was pretty long in the torso, but a belt would help.  Good quality, good value.  Got this for my husband- he's 5'10"" and 275 - he wears a XXL."
4.0,"I ordered these shorts because in the photo they appear to have a smaller waist than other shorts. When I ordered them the waist was bigger than expected. But, the material is overall comfy and stretchy."
4.0,Made very well .good price good shape.
4.0,This item fit well and is very cute.
4.0,The product looks and feels better than expected for the price has really quality feel and so far working fine.
4.0,shipping is some what crappy comes in a bag. lucky it form into shape out of the bag good looking hat<br />like it alot
4.0,I like the dress but it is a little sheer.  I wear dark undergarments and a tank top or sweaters over it and its fine.
4.0,The fabric was not as thick as I had imagined. But they did the trick. I bought these to go along with a travel bag I had purchased for a friend and they worked fine. He pointed out that they can also be used for other things besides shoes so they are multifunctional.
4.0,"Very cute top. Fits better than expected. You dress it casual for work, or dress it up for a night out."
4.0,I like it - a little different xmas sweater and not to heavy
4.0,Good item would’ve liked a lighter color face.
4.0,Super cute!! Luv them wish they was a lil bigger but I'm very satisfied with them.
4.0,"I loved this dress! Last year I wore it to a New Year's Eve party, and felt great in it. Normally, I am between a medium and a large, so I went with a large, and it fit perfectly. I love anything glittery, so this dress immediately caught my eye. Sometimes, sequin can be scratchy or uncomfortable, but this dress was not like that. I'd definitely buy it again!"
4.0,This is a stylish and subtle way to wear cat ears.<br />I bought this hat to add a fun twist to my semi cold weather outfits.  It's perfect since I'm not a 10 year old that can run around in animal ears and get away with it...apparently when you are in your 20's it is not acceptable.  But cue this hat and...VOILA!  It is acceptable and dare I even say cute and fashionable too!
4.0,"I've wanted an all gold watch with a steel mesh band and I came up on this, which was the best based on what I could find! The watch is nice and stylish. However, sometimes the clasp does pop open and it annoys me."
4.0,"I bought this bracelet as a gift and my friend loved it! It was a little snug at first, but stretched some with wear."
4.0,My wife says she loves it and that it is very comfortable and soft
4.0,The quality of the dress is good and it is very cute but you have to be very slim and have not bumps or rolls.  I kept it hoping that I will fit into it at some time.
4.0,"This hoodie was on the larger size, but it's a good comfortable, oversized hoodie. Love the colors and it's very comfy."
4.0,"Love this shirt and the faces people who do not understand,, make. However, go up a size. I wear a. Xl and bought an XXL. fits perfect.  Over best shirt ever!"
4.0,"Looks great, fits like a glove. I'm really a fan of HOMEYEE, even though I was skeptical at first. But you can't beat the price, and they just look so good when worn.  I'm taking off one star because the one I received was not a half sleeve, it was a short sleeve. I don't have crazy long arms or anything, it was a short sleeved dress. That's okay with me, because I really would rather it be shorter, but absolutely NOT a half sleeve."
4.0,Love everything! Only suggestion is the slip inside can be a bit longer
4.0,"These are SO close to 5 stars. The ONLY issue I have is that they put a clothing tag right on the butt area and therefore it creates a bunching up, unflattering line. Why do you even need this tag? Otherwise I would order every style and color! I already ordered 5 pairs and I love them. Best leggings ever! I hope they stop putting tags on the butt though. If they ever stop placing this tag I will buy them all! Seriously they are amazing leggings."
4.0,Just need to find the right bra for this dress.Dress hugs my cruves perfect 👌🏾
4.0,"I purchased this dress on a whim to wear to a family Christmas party, and it was a hit! I normally wear a size 12, but I ordered an XXL because I didn't want the dress to fit too tight, so it was a little loose, but not extremely so. The pattern was bright and vivid. It felt a bit like wearing a nightgown it was so comfortable. I may purchase another for next year!"
4.0,The color was not as pictured . Wanted teal but they are a baby/sky blue other than that they are very comfortable.
4.0,Nice . Just what I ordered . I needed some ying and yang back in my life . I need the balance of ying &yang.
4.0,Snug and loose at the same time. Crotch area was baggy and waist was snug.
4.0,"This is a darling top, however I feel it runs too large. I am 5 ft. 1 inch 120 lbs. I ordered a med instead of small based on reviews. The item is too large. I am hoping to exchange it for a small. The top also took over a month to arrive."
4.0,"Product quality is good, but size mentioned is small as mentioned."
4.0,Had a couple stains on the pocket but otherwise very cute and as expected.
4.0,"The ring really looks better than I imagine. The design is really great looking to have come from such an inexpensive ring. At the end of the day, I would buy this ring again."
4.0,"Bought for Motorcycle Riding, it did stop the Sunburn."
4.0,Buckle is not black pictures show blackout buckle sliver color suppose to be blackout not.
4.0,cute but runs small.  fast service
4.0,The girls loved it.
4.0,"I'm used to wearing Adidas workout shorts, and these can't replace 'em. The materials are nice, but the tapered fit is weird, both in appearance and wear. They seem to be a good quality overall, and the reflective material is definitely highly reflective."
4.0,"Love the fit, the cat eye style takes some getting used to"
4.0,"I got the shoes at a very good deal like $6 when it was on promotion. I don’t think it worth $20 the original price, but for the price I got I will keep it. Size fit as expected or maybe run small a little bit, it does fit wide feet. I probably wouldn’t buy any sandal in this material again because my kid feet got hot and sweaty, even the shoe is open toed."
4.0,When a young coworker of mine came in one day wearing an actual safety pin in his ear I shook my head. I'm all for the idea but why wear that when there are cooler looking ones out there than the ones actually used for diapering. I picked this set up for myself knowing I was only going to wear one so I gave him the other and he loved it. Wore it until all the black coloring wore off sadly. So while it's sure to get you loads of compliments (everyone told him how cool it was and many wanted to know where to get their own) it is worth noting the plating on this will wear off over time.
4.0,to thin for me gave to daughter
4.0,"Get a size smaller, comes bigger than normal sizes"
4.0,"Kids were very excited when they saw the hats. Would have received a 5 but the fur balls (under chin) came off (unstitched)  on many of the hats. They were not rough with them, the balls just came off."
4.0,"Fit as described,  but neckline is very high. Also sleeves are tight by design, which I didn't like, but that's me. Does have a bit longer back than front. Washed well."
4.0,Like this sweatshirt that looks like s casual top. Its not too heavy. Drapes nice and colors are well pigmented.<br />I like that its separate pieces of fabric for each color block not just one piece dyed in strips.<br />I like the unique neckline too. Looks feminine and modest. The length was good too-hangs to about mid hip in my XL.
4.0,Ordered adult size for my adult size 11 year old.. it was really too big ... but he loves it!!
4.0,I like the look of this wood watch. It feels very light on the wrist. I thought the female version would be a bit smaller than men's but it's still larger than i thought it would be as a female watch.
4.0,Supper cute material is kind of itchy at first. Keep in mind this is kind of like a cropped sweater it is very short.
4.0,Great dress For the right price for a cruise formal night. Little loose around top for me—when I leaned over it was not tight enough against my skin. Might be my body shape though.
4.0,"I bought this to wear to a wedding and I really loved the way it looked; however, the inside of the waistband is quite scratchy so I was very ready to take the dress off at the end of the night. This should be an easy fix since I'm sure I can put something over the inside area to make it less uncomfortable. Overall it's a great dress that feels quite sturdy and I'm happy I made the purchase! I would happily recommend for others to buy it since it fits so well! Just beware of the inside scratchiness."
4.0,Great bargain.  I keep it at work to wrap up when it's cold in the office.  Several coworkers inquired where I got it.
4.0,"The dress was nicely made and good value.  Unfortunately, the dress was too small for me and the color was not as deep as I expected.  I might reorder the next size, but I am wanting a deeper plum to match the other bridesmaids.  Plum can vary quite a bit, but I don't want to stand out from the other 3 bridesmaids."
4.0,"These are really cool rings.<br /><br />The turquoise seems a little cheap or fake but just a little.<br /><br />I have thick knuckles so I was pleased to find that all the rings fit. They fit almost too well, as I was only able to use one ring as a midi ring...which is the reason I wanted this set. Oh well, still worth it."
4.0,"Very nice, soft, light weight cardigan; if you order the best size you can layer it like the model. I wear a size 2 and purchased  a small. Plenty of space in the bodice area and sleeves were perfect length. Can't wait to wear sweater with matching hounds-tooth handbag and heels. Worth the price for building your wardrobe. Classy and chic!"
4.0,It’s very conformity.
4.0,Light breathable material same colored stitching like that’s it has a bit of a stretch. I’m 5’3 165lbs very bottom heavy most rompers don’t fit my top compared to my bottom but this works well. The belt included is too big for me but i still love the suit .... may try a medium just to test the size
4.0,"I like the color and design, it is a bit bigger than expected...."
4.0,"Love this dress!  I wear a 16/18 and it fit perfectly!  My best friend even ordered two for herself.  The only thing to keep in mind is to hang dry it.  It made it into the dryer and while it didn’t shrink too bad, it made the bottom seam some what crooked and slightly shorter.  Now that I know that, I hang it dry and it’s fine.  Worth the money!"
4.0,I am tall and this is a little short for the office – hits my a couple inches above the knee. But it is cute and I think it'll be good once it's tight season
4.0,I thought it has excellent detail. Good sturdy though a little heavy for a necklace. And the person I gave it to told me he had one previously but the back detail diminished with ware.
4.0,Granddaughter loves these shoes.  Would give them 5 stars but they run a little small.
4.0,"My daughter loved her pajamas.  They fit great, ran a little big, which she prefers for her pj’s to fit a little large.  The material is thin and very comfortable for sleeping.  The only con that made me lower a star is because the neckline on the top is a little larger than my daughter prefers - but overall, she loves wearing them.  Very happy with pj’s."
4.0,"I initially bought the blue and loved it so much immediately turned around and bought the pink. Just recently bought the silver (white) and I stack all 3 and love the look! No green finger. I wear them on my index finger and it's slightly rough on the side of my bird finger lol but nothing that leaves any marks, rash or anything like that."
4.0,I have short arms so it's a little long there but otherwise it does exactly what I bought it for.
4.0,Very pretty gown. Too hot for florida.
4.0,Really like this.  Was disappointed about how the neck attaches.  Expected one of those metal belt loopy things but if you look close in the pic.  Its just tied there.  I didn't notice it.  BUT still love it and use it and my cocktail or beer fit in the front pock while my hands are full from carrying everything in from the grill!!
4.0,"Nice and sparkly, interesting look overall.  A little smaller than I thought, but I didn't measure or anything, so that's on me.  Would be appropriate for any age - small enough for a little girl but classy enough for a grown woman."
4.0,This was really cute on my twins
4.0,"As depicted; smaller than I thought it would be. It looked a bit small, even though it was used by kids rather than adults."
4.0,"Stylish, not helpful in direct Sun-light"
4.0,"Beautiful, elegant watch.  I have a tiny wrist and need help on removing some of the links to make it fit.  For now, I keep it in my pocket."
4.0,My son has a big head for a one year old just saying...
4.0,"Bought to fit inside Bogs rain boots, size 10. They did not fit as intended. Unsure if sending back for larger size or if worth the hassle. Very soft and cute. Too big to be warn as slippers as some advertise and too big to put on child first then in boot--other way around ok for us.  They do fit in his size 9 snow boots just fine. I am assuming the shaft on the Bogs were too tall and wide, no fault of these, just not what I purchased them for. Can't speak to the left or right on here teaching my child his left from right.<br /><br />My son loves dogs and is particularly happy to wear boots. He thinks these only have one eye and tries to tuck the whole thing into the boot. Turns out the cuteness factor is more for moms. Kiddo could most definitely careless."
4.0,They are o.k.
4.0,Great quality for a medical bracelet. Beautifully designed. My teenager loves the discreet description.
4.0,"I bought a size way too big. Size down. These are not see through at all. So, no worries there. They might be tan through for me, because they are too loose. If you buy them in the right size they might be a 30 SPF. Also, there is a modesty lining in the crotch, which is probably not necessary. Because of the fine mesh fabric, they are very cool. Not hot like most multi-lined bikinis. I would have been happier if I ordered the right size and I wish the tankini was available on Amazon Prime."
4.0,Color is not as pictured. It is more of a true red. Disappointed in that.<br />Fit is true to my normal size of xl.<br />Wanted to wear this to school functions but its red not burgundy (school color) as described.
4.0,Size is not for women with curves more for straight body structure since material does not stretch. Bought largest size and it did not work. Ended up giving it to a friend who was size 10
4.0,I'm 6 foot tall and it's hard to find these items that are long enough. It's as if you have to be larger in the waist to find these that fit. I am not a thin person.
4.0,"Love the jeans but i should have went up a size,  it needs a bit more stretch to it, and needs to come up a little higher on the belly. Other wise I'm very pleased with the product"
4.0,"My daughter loves mermaids so I thought I'd try this swimsuit! It really is a cute suit! The top fits great, the bottoms are alittle big."
4.0,"Cute for the price.  I didn't give it 5 stars because my size was not a free return, and I didn't catch that some sizes are free returns and others are not.  My fault but still a little frustrating.  In the end, I think it will be a cute dinner dress for a trip to Mexico so I'm glad I didn't return it.  Purchased the coral and its pretty, the white print is a little loud in contrast and the back is plain, so its an abrupt end to the pattern, but for the price its made well, it fits very nicely, and its a light and comfortable material.  I wear a size 8/10 petite and the large fit perfectly."
4.0,"The fabric is great, stretchy but fitted and doesn't stretch out (stays snug and fit to the body). The bra shelf is a little &#34;short&#34;, meaning it doesn't hold a lot (larger breasted might find the internal bra a bit small). Overall, LOVE these and will probably buy all the colors and tones."
4.0,For a 38DDD it fit well under my dirndl.
4.0,"I like these replacements, though I suppose I mash the joysticks pretty hard because after a few months I ended up having to replace the replacement on the left hand joystick as well. I know many gamers don't mash the movement joystick, but if you do (like me) this is a good factory replacement for the rubber joystick pads.<br /><br />I have moved over to the aluminum joystick replacements and they are pretty comfortable and don't have the same problem with wearing out."
4.0,"The color is as shown, a very vibrant blue.  The material is soft and fits well.  I will order a second one in a different color if it's available.  It is perfect to wear to work."
4.0,Pretty shoe
4.0,"does the job, fits as expected.<br />nothing to complain about."
4.0,"The underwear fit great, they have just enough room to feel comfortable but are still tight enough to give you support. They could however make the open fly a little bigger, and they need to make these without a tag because I have been bothered by it a few times already, not badly but still I dislike the tag. Also the matirial is very comfortable, I would definitely recommend these."
4.0,My mother liked this outfit.
4.0,Not bad with the price
4.0,"This dress is adorable. I got the off-white one covered in grinning pumpkins. It's completely see-through, though, so I returned it."
4.0,A little too small for computer components.
4.0,"She love them great protection, and she likes how they fit"
4.0,"I like them so far, it's going to take some time to break them in."
4.0,Needs to form to your dome so the beanie is really small at first but after you break it in it's amazing. (:
4.0,This is a very beautiful bangle for the price.<br />I don't think you can't go wrong with this.<br />Comes in many different colors.
4.0,Bought for sister in law. Super cute. She loves it
4.0,"These are lovely 6mm pearl earrings. I have a nickel allergy, and the posts do not cause a reaction. They are very comfortable to wear, and the backings are great for keeping the earrings snug. The only issue is that they have a peach tone, which is not what I was expecting from the photo and the description, but I still like them enough to keep them."
4.0,"I bought for a themed bachelorette party and didn't end up wearing it.  This is a cute top but time got away from me and I can't return it...so I'm stuck with this top that I'll never wear.  It's decent quality so I'm going to try to find a time to wear it even once. I do like the longer cut, works nice with leggings or tighter pants and covers your bum and crotch areas."
4.0,"Super flattering dress, print and style exactly like picture. Good length but a little on the thinner side. Not see through but not very thick"
4.0,It was perfect for the  Downton Abbie premier party we went to. There was a costume party and we won.
4.0,I got this for my very small 2 year old fits slightly big bt smaller than other 2t clothes... While it was adorable nd cute on a button fell off the first time she wore it
4.0,Great for boys and girls!
4.0,"It was a bit smaller than expected, but nothing a good body shaper can't fix."
4.0,It’s very cute but also VERY see-through.
4.0,Little too tight on my girl
4.0,"I like the top but even from the description, it isn't evident that the side slits go up past your ribs. That may be just me, I ordered an M/L but I'm 5'8&#34; with a looong torso so for me, the slits make it a crop top with front and back modesty veils... even then the possibility of sideboob is high. Regardless I like it and the knit material is slinky, heavy, but not too heavy and it's washed well once so far."
4.0,"The shoulder bag is lovely and has ample room and compartments.  It is nicely made and like the quality.  My only dislike is that I expected the color to be white or a very pale gray.  The online picture was deceiving.  When it arrived, it is a bone or very light beige.  Still very pretty, but again, not the color I had hoped for.  It is still nice and wears with everything, so I am overall happy, otherwise."
4.0,"I bought these shorts in an xl in navy. They fit well. Of course they're snug, but not at all uncomfortable. I was pleasantly surprised. I normally wear a sz 12."
4.0,The stone is a little big for me but other then that its good quality and i do like it
4.0,"The fabric of these gaiter masks is thicker than many of the extremely thin gaiters I've seen, still very easy to breathe through, and hold minimal warmth.  The fabric has an almost fleecy inner texture to it, very comfortable.  The earloops are comfortable and effective to keep the mask in place.<br />Another feature of these masks is the drape.  Unlike many gaiters that provide an almost grotesque outline of the face in the snug form fit, these gaiter masks fit snugly over the nose and was only snug enough over cheeks and mouth to 'suggest' facial shape, more of a close drape.  I was actually hoping it would be a little bit looser over the mouth and jaw.<br />Despite the slightly thicker fabric, this gaiter cannot effectively filter droplets either to protect the wearer or to protect others nearby.  I would find this useful only in situations where we could maintain distance from others not of our household, primarily outdoors.<br />The inside of the fabric is pale, and would not be as attractive if worn reversed.  The vertical seam must be to the back for the earloops to fit appropriately."
4.0,"Cute but almost no stretch, and runs small. I'm a size 14 and the XXL doesn't fit"
4.0,Exactly as described. Thank you.
4.0,Nice .
4.0,"Nice socks.... soft, comfy and warm"
4.0,I really like the color of these frames and the no lines multidirectional is great but the lenses were larger than I expected.
4.0,"Good material nice feel but my girl doesn't like the elastic waist, she says its too thin/narrow and it leaves a deep mark after wearing them for a while, make the elastic wider for 5 stars"
4.0,"I have gotten these socks for my husband and he likes wearing them.  My husband never really wears no show socks with his low cut shoes but these socks have made them more comfortable to wear.  He has worn them a lot of times already and also have washed them a lot and they still look great.  He did feel that the size fits him well.  The material and make us soft to the feet when I tried them on also.  It is suppose to be made of natural bamboo fiber and more resistant in odors.  When he wears them in his shoes, you cannot tell that he is wearing socks inside.  He also likes that there is a grip on the heel to prevent it from slipping off his feet.  He definitely has added these no show socks in his wardrobe.<br /><br />Disclaimer:  This product was received for free for the purpose of a product review.  This is also an unbiased opinion."
4.0,These earrings are very chic stylish look expensive and are light weight 3 /6 arrived broken from the hoop stem -connected to the acrylic  .very unhappy about that.<br />The pics I posted is just the stem placed into hole but not secured ..
4.0,"they fit very snug, looked great. would definitely buy in different styles. the top one didn’t look that good on me, maybe on others it will look good. the bottom one was bomb and totally worth it"
4.0,"Yes, you can buy full-leather suits or even separate leather pants that may give you greater ultimate protection, but for those who want something that looks even somewhat like an ordinary pair of pants and you can remove the armor from to increase that effect once you get where you're going, the Charger Jeans are excellent. The knee/shin armor is legit - Dainese's bulky Kit J E1 armor, included (and adjustable), and the pro-shape armor for hip pads.<br /><br />Neither of the following are deal-breakers, but the jeans do sit unusually low for a riding pant. Perhaps that's just the way they fit me, and it can certainly be adjusted with a belt. I'm also not a fan of the button-fly aspect of things, never was, stretching all the way back to Levi's. They're just too much work/fuss when compared to the usual excellent zippers Dainese uses on most of their euro-focused pants. Not sure why they elected to go with this much sillier and more time-consuming method for the Charger jeans, but perhaps Dainese just looked at the iconic American jean (Levi's 501) and concluded this is what the US market must want. Maybe some do, but not me."
4.0,"is a little large on my arm but I have small wrist.  Very easy to read and great for everyday, knock around activities."
4.0,"they work well.  super fat, may make it difficult to get all watch bands on, but thats literally why I bought them.  I used one...then lost the rest..."
4.0,It's really pretty. The straps just don't adjust so I had to put a small knot in the back for it to fit properly
4.0,looks good like the fit
4.0,when I feed the fish eat a lot of floating with XL Pro 5mm
4.0,"Purchased in early July and have worn this most days, still love it holding up well.<br />Only thing that would make it better is if it was a tad bit longer!"
4.0,Super cute. True to size.
4.0,Replaced my leather Cognac with this sleeker black rubber as it works with many more outfits. Only problem I really have is that the left over strap slips from the horizontal fastener sometimes but it may just be me as I'm highly active when wearing my moto. Definitely not a bad product however.
4.0,"This is a great product, it keeps me super warm! Just dont wear it with black pants - it sheds!"
4.0,"Fast shipment ,good Material;Not good it was a Little to big."
4.0,really helped
4.0,"This Orchid Row Women’s faux fur ‘scarf’ is super cute, however, it looked too young on me. I don’t mind that it’s small, for it’s more of a neck warmer I suppose than a scarf.<br /><br />It’s fun and playful and super soft and warm on my neck but it looked ridiculous on me but I gave it a try since I thought the photo looked fun. But, I’m going to send it to my 9 year old granddaughter, who will love it and wear it.<br /><br />The flowers are so cute. One side is white with the black flowers and the other side is black. It’s soft and ‘furry’ but of course is synthetic.<br /><br />I think almost $30 (at time of this review) may be too much for this, however, it does look well made.<br /><br />There’s a slit in the black side to slide the flowered side into so the scarf stays in place, and it does. It comes up a little high on the neck in the back so it looked a little odd.<br /><br />I think my granddaughter will have fun with it.<br /><br />It doesn’t have to be just for kids—A woman could wear this as a fun accessory, but on me it just did not look right."
4.0,Comfy and fun dress!! Lots of compliments!!
4.0,"Runs a little smaller than expected but looks nice on and the material is soft but not thick.  You couldn't go be a lumberjack in this top, it's more for home or office.  Wash on gentle or hand wash only."
4.0,looks faded
4.0,I love it!! The dress is beautiful
4.0,It fits my son very well!
4.0,"Very pleased with these. My son works in a restaurant kitchen and has to cover his tattoos. They are cool, and hold up well."
4.0,The dress looks exactly like it does in the picture. Great quality for a great price.
4.0,So far the leggings are perfect. In fact I intend to order another pair.<br />They feel very nice
4.0,Super cute. Wish there were more options than &#34;one size&#34; though. I want matching tutus for my girls and can't find any that aren't one size. :/
4.0,Need to manufacture a smaller version of this hat
4.0,Is bigger than I expected but is ok looks good either way. The finish touch is very good.
4.0,I enjoy them very much. Fits perfect
4.0,Commencement ceremony
4.0,Beautiful.. I loved it
4.0,"Fair price for the size and quantity. Fit well right out of the pack, fit better after a wash. Bought two packages, will be buying more packs"
4.0,It took a long time for it to ship but the product is great
4.0,These are comfortable and durable. boys wear them for baseball
4.0,"Live the top. Fabric is nice but tag specifies hand washing. I prefer to know that upfront. If you order,  do so in a size up. Sizing was smallish."
4.0,"Although the picture is not accurate, (actual earrings have an indention along the edge to place a rubber o-ring and picture doesn't show this) I received them on time and was otherwise satisfied."
4.0,"Very sharp and fashionable looking, just wish they had included instructions on how to set the different elements of the watch....as of yet, I cannot set the date on the watch!!"
4.0,Band at top just a little snug.
4.0,"I’m 5’6 and usually a medium. It fit perfectly, however the strap broke while trying it on. It’s cheap material, but super cute."
4.0,"I really like this dress. I wasn’t sure what to expect but am so pleased. I usually where a 12 dress because on top I am a 38DD. I bought the XL. It wasn’t clingy and felt very comfortable. I bought it for Indonesia. The weather there is hot, hot, hot. I think this fabric will keep me cool, wash easily and dry quickly. I plan on buying another."
4.0,"Pendant was slightly smaller than expected, but really cute. Gave it as a gift and she really liked it."
4.0,"Took a while to get these, but it was worth it"
4.0,The band is sturdy and will hold up to regular wear and washing. The size is great for someone who requires a larger band but I will need to cut it down to make it comfortable to wear.
4.0,"A really cute shoe.  I brought the 1.5 in children's for my niece who wears a size 2.  I was a little worried that the shoe might be too small but they were a little big, so a 2.5 would've been way too big."
4.0,"Although it is big, I still like it, remember it's one size fits all an I'm pretty tiny."
4.0,Excelente inversión calidad precio lo único q vienen sin estuche
4.0,"was as expected, a little TOO Delicate but will serve it's purpose"
4.0,It looks just like the picture but if you have a small chest this may not be for you or you may have to go a size smaller
4.0,"I bought this for my granddaughter; it’s very cute on her. She turned 2 in April, but still can wear 18mo in most brands. The size 2 fits just right, so this may run a bit small. The dress is very lightweight and great for summer in Texas!"
4.0,Love them! The waist is high enough that if I bend over no one sees your crack and i like the material it's made out of.
4.0,Fits my curves like a glove
4.0,"I love these glasses , I have gotten a lot of complements on them."
4.0,simple and compact. better than a purse at times.
4.0,A little small but overall very satisfied.
4.0,"DISCLAIMER: I'm using this watch band custom-fitted to an off brand smart watch not listed as compatible. (TLDR available below)<br /><br />It's a darn good thing they gave us three springs for the quick-release because the very first one I started to put on my watch went BOING across the room! I appreciate them so much for covering my clumsy butt.<br /><br />So I've worn the watch a few weeks now. I'm happy to see that it fits tightly enough that my average watch readings, from steps, to heartbeats, to sleeping patterns, don't seem to have changed any. I am happy with how generous the band fit ranges are because I have pretty fat wrists at 8.5"" around and these fit wonderfully in the spot I like my watch 1 1/2 inches above the wrist bone with lots of extra room if I needed it. The circumference of the band is big enough that I can fit my hand through it without having to completely take the magnet end out of the loop. Although I'm also very happy to say if you needed to do that, you can. The magnet end fits through the loop if you need it to, and I think that's a good thing. The watch feels light and delicate. I have the shimmery finish and hope it lasts a good long while, it's the only thing I can see might be an issue.<br /><br />I don't have an expensive smartwatch. I have one of those cheap $35 versions that use an annoying off-size  19mm watch band quick release that doesn't match any other major brand smart watches like Apple, Fitbit, Galaxy, Samsung. So when I see watch bands available I get frustrated because I can't find any for me and this nasty silicone rubber stuff all smartwatches come with are gross. They get filthy with dead skin and for some reason when you try to wash them the dirt and stuff won't come off even when you scrape it with your fingernails. So I filed the plastic tongs of my smart watch so it fits 20mm bands and here we are. I just wanted you to know... to be honest. Oh, and if you want another good word about this watchband? I was using an industrial steel cutting file for automotive work to try to file down the edges of the band where it connects to my plastic watch housing and couldn't really get it down too good to fit until I gave up and filed the watch instead. So hey, sturdy!!!"
4.0,Loved most of the charms.  The big box ones don't work on bracelets but may on a necklace
4.0,I honestly don’t know what gauge is what
4.0,Nice fit is good.
4.0,Really cute shirt I love it!
4.0,"Cute necklace, got lots of compliments but obviously doesn't look good for long, you get what u pay for"
4.0,Great 👍🏼 but watch out for underwear lines
4.0,"This would be a 5 star rating, but, the gray isn't gray...it's taupe which totally clashes with the slacks I purchased them for.  It's a nicely made shoe and is very comfortable."
4.0,Very comfortable for a supportive stocking.<br />Fun design. Thanks!
4.0,Great watch. Very happy with it.
4.0,7 of the 8 have held up well but one broke before I could get it in my ear.
4.0,"I was slightly disappointed that they are duller than they appear in the images. I read reviews, so knew to anticipate the small size. All things considered, they are adorable and I'm glad I got them."
4.0,"I bought two pairs in different sizes because I was not sure what size I would need. The large were a bit small ( although that would normally be my size) so they do run a bit small. The Xlarge fit better but unfortunately the Donuts on the side were horribly crooked :( but this was not the case with the other pair. That being said, they are cute & I do love the cotton fabric as I am not a fan of the shiny leggings.  I am re-ordering another XL hoping that the donuts will not be crooked."
4.0,I wish the material was more cotton rather than polyester. Other than that its beautiful and I love it. It fits me perfectly as well.
4.0,"I wanted this jacket because it reminded me of the one Vanessa Hudgens, who I love, is always wearing but less money possible. The color I picked out wasn't tan like her jacket but I love the deep olive green color. I love how soft it is on the inside and with all this snow coming on and off for the past weeks as well as the cold temperatures and wild chills. This has been great from getting to work and back home. I just make sure I have my hat with me at all times since this doesn't have one<br /><br />The outside of this jacket is velevty and soft and silky to the touch which I love. It gives it an expensive feel. I overall love this jacket however since this doesn't have a hook I've notice some cold air can get down the neck spot because it's not tight against the neck but that doesn't bother me. If that's something you feel will irritate you or bother you this might not be for you.<br /><br />I recieved this product for free in exchange for my honest opinion."
4.0,Light weight and durable.Comes with cool cover that's easy to take with when not in use.
4.0,"I got these gloves for a very specific reason. I had to get part of my pinky amputated due to an injury and I wanted something that would 1. cover what I have left and 2. keep it warm. I have an illness that causes my hands and feet to get cold and swell. Without any swelling these have already started to cut off slight amount of blood flow for only wearing a couple hours. Due to how tight they are it’s not the most comfortable for my pinky either. It may be different once it’s fully healed, but for right now and the purpose I need them for it’s not the best I would say. They aren’t bad at all in fact I love the material, color, and style very much. It definitely covers what I have and the length on my wrist is what I wanted it’s something I could wear in the summer as well they may get a little warm but they’re light enough to do so. They look spot on I got the light gray. It’s only the tightness that is causing an issue and I need as much blood flow as I can for it to heal. I do have bigger hands for a women these may be better for average/smaller hands. I’m going to try to stretch them out a little with an old trick I have an hopefully that’ll help with not cutting off the blood flow."
4.0,"These are very comfortable. For me they are better for general casual-wear as opposed to running as they don’t offer much by way of compression. Nice quality, I wear them for working from home and less for exercise."
4.0,I love the look of these but they are too small.
4.0,"Love the shoes and fit as expected, but unfortunately their not black, their denim blue. Would buy again definitely."
4.0,"Love this watch, only reason not giving 5 stars is because i wished it had an option of getting it a negative face. Am very pleased with the overall performance of the watch. It is a bit bulky which i dont mind but if you dont like the bulkiness then i would recommend staying away from this one. I bought the US version because it was cheaper but this watch is the exact same one from japan but less expensive, quality is the same. I also wished the beavel clicked when changing the direction of the compass. The buttons on the side are gripped nicely i would highly recommend this watch. Awesome awesome watch."
4.0,I didn't have them for very long when the gloves started to develop little burs.... They're relatively warm; they're great for wearing in chillier weather (that doesn't quite warrant full-out mittens) or in a cold building. I like wearing them. :)
4.0,"I got the light pink color and for someone who likes muted colors. This is almost on the bright side. I kept it because I do want to brighten my color palette. The fit was great. Plenty of room. I am 5’4 145 lbs and a medium had plenty of room. It is a crop cut, so I chose to wear some thing underneath it because it does go up really high when I am reaching around for things. But overall good quality really soft on the inside the hood was not annoying or too bulky I’m really happy with the purchase and I would purchase more in different colors."
4.0,Very pretty. Maybe a bit too small for my wrist even with elastic. I have others that are not this way and wrap easily without gaps in beads.
4.0,"This bag is very nice, the leather is soft, and roomy. I would have given five stars, except the strap is not the same leather, looks, feels cheap, and hard brittle. I'm not sure how long it will last."
4.0,"The designs are good, material is okay, do feel it was priced high for the material. Got them as Christmas gift."
4.0,The only down fall I have with this watch is that the band is just a little too big for my wrist.  Other than that I like it.
4.0,"Comfortable socks, although I have to give only 4 stars compared to the zero run. I wish Craft still made the zero run / 87-89 socks which were discontinued (see photo). They lasted me over 20 years, and I only have 2 pairs left that are just beginning to develop holes and stretch"
4.0,"This dress fit me well, it is a bit tight in the chest, but so is everything! I wear a medium but am a 38 DD, so there is that. The fabric is really thin, but this dress is still cute. I just wore a shaper underneath. It does run true to size. It was a reasonable price for one event. Very fast shipping"
4.0,Perfect but when I got it the band pin pusher was broken
4.0,Loved them!! Purchasing two more as gifts!!😊
4.0,"Good quality, thick fabric.  It does run a little small.  If I lose a few lbs, I'll be wearing this all over town."
4.0,"I like these except for the fact that they are a little large. The color is nice and bright though, gotta love that for sure."
4.0,Fit as expected but have conformed to the shape of my feet for a good fit.
4.0,Nice cover. Too several weeks to arrive.
4.0,Good buy even holding up to washing does snag the material not a work shirt for sure but good for casual wear
4.0,If you normally wear a size small/medium this hat will fit you nicely. The bill is longer than the average hat by an inch and the one I recieved has a snap back.
4.0,Very cute dress. I’m 5’5” 135 lbs and ordered a medium. Fits great.
4.0,"It fits well but would fit better if the sash went over the lace material instead of the dress being sewed to the top and bottom of sash. I have feeling the sash section is going to roll over instead of staying in place. I do like the way it feels and fits. I wear 18/20 and it fits well. It is a pretty dress.<br /><br />Update: I wore the dress to a wedding. I received many compliments. The arm holes fit tight around my arms and I am hoping to be able to loosen somehow. It was a bit uncomfortable. I was also correct about dress rolling over sash area. I had to keep pulling dress down while I was sitting and always when I stood up to straighten it out. Overall, still a 4 star rating since the dress is very beautiful and a great price."
4.0,Wish that the bottom was a little more loser.
4.0,"The arms were a little tight, even though the recommended size for me was small. I order a medium and it was too big"
4.0,average sports bras
4.0,"They are very nice, and warm too. Thank you"
4.0,"My father has a shoe shine valet that he made back in high school shop class and I have always wanted my own but have never been able to craft one. My wife bought this one for me for Christmas and it does a good job. It has enough space for all the brushes and polishes that come with the box and the ones I already owned. But it is also not too big to be able to place in a corner out of the way. When I was attaching the stand on the top the wood slightly cracked, but this does not diminish the quality of the product nor does it limit my use of it. Very happy with this gift."
4.0,"Light wood, and  cute, great price"
4.0,Nice just wish it came with both options—
4.0,"I've purchased this Item & I've removed the original Pin... Now I'm using it with the original Garmin pin (26mm long X 2mm dia) for my Garmin Descent MK2I... & it is working perfectly... this way -IMO- the watch is more secure than any 3rd party band with ""Quick Release"" buckles."
4.0,"My first silk PJs-- I washed them before I wore them-- hand washed, blotted on towel and hung on a hanger-- they needed no ironing (thank heavens) and they felt great in bed-- no sweating!  I didn't like the big covered buttons on the front-- I may change those to thinner buttons but they felt OK.  Really like these."
4.0,"Good quality, thick leather. We'll see in 6 months how she wears."
4.0,"I ordered the navy blue in 3x to wear for an upcoming wedding. I ordered according to measurements and it fit, just not in a way I would wear. I also felt like the line, I imagine is there for the slimming effect, is in an odd place. The dress is well-made with a heavy lined silky fabric and it is beautiful. Overall, this style of dress does not compliment my body shape, or I am too self- conscious, either way it is gorgeous and well made."
4.0,"Great bra for working out.  I would like it more if it had just a tad bit more support. It is pretty good, but I am large breasted and running can be kinda painful. If this bra had just a little bit more support for running it would be the perfect bra."
4.0,Tight and short I went up two sizes cute and fun
4.0,Fit well at first very comfortable they do tend to ride up though the day
4.0,This is very cute and comfy.
4.0,Tons of earings for the price! I mostly bought these for the hoops and was a little disappointed in the size of the earrings. They are pretty tiny but i was happy they didn't break when i put them in. If you like studs this is a decent pack to get.
4.0,"This dress is very cute and is well made but runs a full size too small.<br />I ordered size XL for my size L (10/12) small chested daughter.  It fit her well and looked super cute, but she returned it because it looks 'Too Amish'... Lol"
4.0,Nice belt. Comfortable without breaking in.
4.0,These were great for making seasonal earrings and bracelets. There were a lot of broken pieces in the lot.
4.0,"I really like this. Fits well. The only complaint I have is there is a lot of padding to the top and it can not be removed. Otherwise,​ I am very happy with it"
4.0,"My cowokers like it, and me too. lol"
4.0,"Bought to use as an angel costume, and it should work great. Fits wonderfully, it is made well with decent materials."
4.0,"My husband wears only Ralph Lauren Polo chino shorts. He recently has had trouble finding them at a good price, at the department stores. Sizing on the shorts has always been an issue. No two pairs of 32 are cut the same.  He purchased the olive color at a good price and they fit perfectly.  The white is two sizes too big and the Khaki are one size too big. The material is what he wanted, the heavier chino, some version on Amazon are the thinner material. Anyway, happy with the Olive color the other colors not so much."
4.0,"Bright and fun, Great for the price!"
4.0,Doesn't cover nipples but does create great cleavage
4.0,"Soft yoga pants, fit as expected, but they stretch out really easily."
4.0,"Very nice necklace, and not heavy at all. I love it."
4.0,Too large on top but I can easily sew that. I bought larger size because I don't like it tight.
4.0,I like it but it is hard to get the top on
4.0,The m material was so soft and she said the Jamie’s were comfortable
4.0,"I wear a women's size 7.5-8; the socks fit great. The seam runs along the front of my toes, making them feel a bit odd at times(which may be bothersome to someone with longer toenails) but because the fabric is soft, comfortable, and my nails are short, this is not a problem for me. The prints are beautiful, just as pictured. These no-shows are the perfect weight - not too thin, not too thick - and the price was ideal.<br /><br />Because of my excitement when receiving a new pair of socks, I always forget to use scissors to cut the plastic &#34;barb&#34; that holds the socks onto the packaging... which leaves a hole in sock. Hopefully this serves as a great reminder for future purchasers!"
4.0,"Ok I LOVE this sweater BUT, there were no instructions nor tags on care of sweater. There were two (2) loose threads on the front that kept running just from walking. I have attempted to stop the thread runs. Fingers crossed. Since there were no care instructions or tags for care... when in doubt, I do ONLY a cold hand wash gently. LOVE the look, just a little scared of the quality."
4.0,Love my silver hoops. Nice quality.
4.0,"These were a bit big on my child, but I expected that since I am unsure of what size to get my weed.  It has been a few months and my child loves them.  The zipper is a clever idea but does not quite work out.  The shoestrings have to be untied and the zipper unzipped when taking off.  Otherwise they are good.  I wish they came in wider fit as my child is starting to complain about her toes being squeezed from the sides."
4.0,Stylish and nice fit. The coating on the glass is not of good quality though.
4.0,"These are very nice earrings . I am partial to pearls , especially grey pearls . These have good lustre and are well matched . Not quite as shiny as the photo online depicts , but I realize that pearls hard  to photograph , unlike faceted gemstones . I would tell anyone who likes grey pearls that these are good and worth the price ."
4.0,"The tunic being sold isn’t the one in the image (left tunic) but the right and is of a thinner and rather lower quality, but serves its purpose if you’re just wanting a Sith/black jedi tunic."
4.0,"Very cute and stretchy material. Amazon told me my fit would be a medium so I originally got it in that size, but the sleeves were a little too long and the the dress was too slouchy. I’m 5’1,” 140 lbs, 27 in pants, usually a small/medium in shirts (medium if I want a loose fit). The medium in this dress hit my knees.<br /><br />I reordered in a small and it was perfect. It hit right above my knees. But I noticed the collar only had pearls on one side. Haha. I don’t mind it without the pearls, I just want both sides to be the same. I returned it and they’re sending a replacement out."
4.0,"Shrinks quite a bit, but I still wear it to bed, but with bottoms now."
4.0,"These glasses are ultra cool. It is very well-made: lens, frame, shields, and ear hooks.  Depending on where you are and the climate, it sometimes fogs up near the shields but that is a minor gripe.  My major gripe: the case is god-awfully small.  These do not fold flat so you can't hang it on your shirt, either.  Its too bad they didn't bother giving it any thought considering the price they charge for these glasses.  That aside, I love these glasses and the protection and visibility during a bright sunny day is excellent."
4.0,"The bag IT was ok, but doesnt send  mede padded  strap."
4.0,Fits kind of small but still wearable.
4.0,Was comfortable to swim in.
4.0,Prettier than expected. Very pleased!
4.0,I love how thick and warm it is perfect for the fall super cute
4.0,"Got this for my kindergartener. Lighter weight than expected, but colors are bright and my kid loves it. Wish the bottom of backpack was padded. I like that there’s hidden back compartment where your back goes."
4.0,It’s buttery soft on my shoulders and back. It slipped on without hooks and my boobs stayed in place for my entire shift.
4.0,"They're just really comfortable. Nice light, breathable material. They are a really good compromise between briefs and boxers. I always seem to be sitting on the edge of briefs which can get uncomfortable, and boxers offer zero support. These really are the best of both worlds. The price is decent for what you get. There is a tag, which I can't seem to feel while wearing them. That is an odd choice as most underwear puts the tag on the waistband, but this is a more conventional tag on the inside, outer edge. I would have expected tagless or a rim tag but since I can't seem to feel the tag, I guess it's fine. I do not recommend trying to remove the tag. It's solidly sewn in for some reason."
4.0,"It’s very cute, but it runs bigger than I thought."
4.0,"This is a great necklace.  However, after my child wore it in the ocean for a couple of days the words are faint and hard to read."
4.0,Loved these for working in the hospital. They did fall off my head and broke very easily though.
4.0,A little sheer on top-would need to wear a camisole under
4.0,"Good price, ‘fire’, and size."
4.0,Sold piece. A bit bigger than I thought but still cool
4.0,"This dress is a perfect dress up costume for a 2 year old! I love that it is simple and short so she won't trip on it. The only red flag, and I'm glad I read other reviews before purchasing, is that it does run very small. My daughter just turned 2 and I got her a 4T and she is not swimming in it - it fits her with just a little room to grow. So definitely size up on this one!"
4.0,"I ordered an extra large and it fits as it should except that the sleeves are a smidge too long.  I have long arms and most jackets fall short when I extend my arms so I shouldn't complain.  I'm just mentioning it as an FYI to anyone looking to purchase an XL.  Torso and neck fit very well, it's warm and looks good."
4.0,It's so beautiful but to large
4.0,This shirt was massive. I was disgusted when I first held it up to me. I was so pissed I was going to have to surely return but instead I cut the bottom half off & made it into a crop top. It's a loose but it works b/c of the off the shoulder. 1000x times better as a crop & one of my fav shirts now
4.0,I love this little summer dress and it fits perfect I am one happy costumer
4.0,"Fit as expected. Good quality, nice color. Great deal."
4.0,"My toddler likes these, no laces."
4.0,"It’s actually nice and decent quality; not a 2-5 year wallet though...<br /><br /> However, my wife forgot that in America that is by no means a mans wallet... good ol’ vintage emasculation. I may be exaggerating as it was a gift of let down."
4.0,was a little small but it works :) my fiancee loves it
4.0,"I love the handbag.  The quality is very good, the leather is nice and soft.  I got the blue one and the color is really nice. I'm only giving it 4 stars because I have issues with the zippered compartment inside.....it is securely attached at the top but just hangs inside which allows everything you have in the handbag to go under the compartment causing it to keep getting pushed up to the top of the handbag.  They should have attached it at the bottom also to keep it from moving.  Other than that I love it!"
4.0,"it runs really small, im a female and generally wear size medium / small in tops & i ordered this hoodie in a size XXL and fits like a large for reference"
4.0,"Beautifully colored, nice fabric.. Huge gap in the front I may need to sew up a bit. Definitely fits like a long shirt, not a dress. Doesn't cover much in the bottom department."
4.0,"I took this on a trip to Cancun, and it was perfect.  My only complaint is that the top is not adjustable at all, and I would have liked to tighten it up just a little."
4.0,This is a nice sweater vest but as others have said it runs small and is especially short in the back.  It is warm and wool so I think/hope it will stretch to be a little longer in the back with time.
4.0,count fit over my foot gave it ti my daughter.
4.0,Material a little lighter than the pic but love it.
4.0,I love this company and especially these tops I ordered in 3 different colors. Will order more❤️
4.0,Great so far! However one of the chokers came with the chain shorter than the rest and it didn’t fit. But a little innovation with a safety pin mad it perfect
4.0,"Beautiful shirt. Fits kind on weird on the hips (tight), but overall very nice."
4.0,A little small but good quality.
4.0,"Son wears sandals year round at home and around his neighborhood, this was an add on for Christmas. He totally loves them."
4.0,"Great shoes, nice color."
4.0,It’s a tad big but nice and comfy! Took a long time to arrive ‘tho. I would consider buying again if available in different patterns
4.0,"It’s a nice shirt and it fits pretty much as expected. BUT don’t let the description fool you, this us not a sweatshirt. It is a long sleeve t-shirt with a hood. The material feels like good quality, so it’s not a thin t-shirt."
4.0,*Beautiful Dress it has beautiful details &<br />Wonderfully made.<br />×Negative side<br />* Dress is a little bit sheer
4.0,The elastic straps were Too tight at the leg bottoms. I finally cut the lower bands Up 2 inches by the back of my knees because they were very restrictive.
4.0,Like fit casual yet enough support<br />Only negative is the logo placement on side or back be much better
4.0,"I like, beautiful and good product"
4.0,The shirt was just as described. I have no issues with this item
4.0,My toddler loves these light up shoes.  There's a button on the inside that cam change the colors and many different cookout servings including bright flashing and alternation colors.  The lights were nice and bright and lasted for hours.  The only thing holding these back from 5 starts was the usb charging cord that came with them didn't  work.  I used my cellphone charger instead.  I am currently buying these again because my child outgrew them.  Great value!
4.0,"My son likes it a lot, would have gave a 5 star but the strap that holds excess watch band broke in the first month"
4.0,I got these boots on sale at $105 for the Cognac.  I really like them.  I was confused about the sizing as the reviews were mixed so went ahead and ordered my regular size 8 (I wear an 8 in everything).  The boots fit perfectly.  I couldn't wear thick socks with them (have been wearing tights or barefoot) as the boots have shearling inside so will keep me warm.  I think the shearling may wear down a little bit and leather usually stretches a little.  Once that happens the boots will be PERFECT.
4.0,"My first reaction to this sweater was that it was pretty but thin and very stretchy.<br />The fabric was described as “medium weight stretch”. It is definitely a stretch fabric but I would also definitely call it lightweight.<br />The picture on the product page looked to me like a heather grey. The sweater is actually a uniform solid grey, not unattractive, just not what I expected.<br />The size runs a bit small. The sweater fit me very nicely over a thin short-sleeved t-shirt but had no extra room; it definitely stretched when I put it on over a somewhat heavier knit shirt with long sleeves and gapped a bit in the chest when I buttoned it. I have short arms and rather narrow shoulders. The shoulders were actually just a bit tight on me, and the sleeves were perfect. The sweater measures 12 ¾” from armhole to armhole across the back, and the sleeves are 16” long from the armpit to the edge of the cuff.<br />The quality is middling, e.g., on the back of the top buttonhole there is an odd knot in the stitching (in a green thread, not grey) that causes a small pucker in the neck of the sweater next to the buttonhole. This is a very noticeable place on the sweater.  The sweater was packed in a very nice reusable bag, but I would have preferred that attention was paid more to the product than to its packaging.<br />In sum, this sweater is okay for everyday wear, but if you want to wear it over a heavier blouse or sweater, you might want to buy a larger size."
4.0,Durable and gorgeous! My only complaint was that I couldn't customize the message. Luckily &#34;I love you&#34; is as classic as it gets and he loves the unique look to it!
4.0,Started Squeaking in automatic with in 24 hrs. Its pretty and does ok in the other settings. The only fuzzy logic involved is why they made a claim of fuzzy logic.
4.0,"I had to get used to the high neck and the bow, but it's really a flattering cut and a durable, wrinkle-resistant fabric. I needed help to zip it up, but it was really a nice look for a dressy occasion."
4.0,"It looks like the picture, my little sister likes it."
4.0,The devil horns were not standing straight and wig hair was falling off and was unruly.<br />I think that all these is because was packaged in a back and squished badly for a long time
4.0,liked the vibrant colors and it came fast
4.0,"My wife is typically a medium for sports bras, so that's what she ordered for this one. It fits nicely except the straps in the back are a little tight at the upper back. It's good for running or working out, preferably for a short period of time (unless you size up). She liked the support that was offered and liked the look of the straps in the back. Decent bra for the price, just ran a little small is all."
4.0,"I first started hearing about Orient watch after researching several Seiko automatics. Apparently, Orient is one of the oldest Japanese watchmakers and they are recently acquired by the Seiko Group so they are a great watch company. This particular watch (3 star automatic) is nice and it looks very expensive. It will be a nice watch to wear when you dress up because of the watch face. The time and day-dates settings are easy to set-up and it looks like it is accurate and does not lose time. I do want to call out though that the band width for this watch is actually 19mm not 18mm so take a note of that if you are thinking of replacing your watch band."
4.0,Fits well but too long for me. I am 5tt 2ins. Love the material
4.0,These are the cutest socks ever! The price makes them even better. The color is nice and rich and the socks are super soft. The only things is that the fabric is a little thin around the heels.
4.0,Nice sox for my low boots & slip ons
4.0,"This is an absolutely comfortable and flattering dress that has pockets! I mean, don't all women love pockets? The skirt is flowy and has excellent flow capabilities. We all love a skirt that spins and flows. Its lightweight and comfortable. The top is a thin cotton and very soft. For me, the arms were longer than I had hoped. Long enough to have thumb holes I'll add in to them. The neckline is subtle curve and not too deep. This is also a dress that can be worn with leggings and boots in the winter. I 100% love this dress. It can be formal or casual. The colors in the skirt pop and while it is great for the holidays, it doesn't show holiday. The top is very stretchy and I ordered a size up not knowing how the sizing is, but you can order your usual sizes. Its very true to size."
4.0,This is my 3rd scrub shirt from this company.  Durability and quality are great.  Ordered one size up from last time due to mild shrinking over time. Only complaint is it is very boxy.
4.0,These r the lined ones bght because they didn’t have any other smalls left in stock. Velvet lining does hold onto pet fur unlike responder to question stated. Generally these r very flattering the lined ones less so. Wld buy more if they get any of the smallest size (can’t remember if it’s s or xs). 5’4” 100lbs.
4.0,These are really cute earrings but the round ones are not sturdy. The closure is  cheap  and when I try to close it the loop goes all the way in.<br />I don’t want to order both But it’s a good deal
4.0,Washes and dries great. No pilling and no fading. I am not tall but bought a tall size to ensure the length would be appropriate. I will now try a regular in same style different color.
4.0,"I ordered the pink and it didn't look like the pink in the picture but like the blue one on the model . So its still very pretty . As another customer review notes the strap would of been ok with two hooks - this has four hooks , very wide! In a way this looks to me like almost a very retro style bra .. I think its very well made - amazing really for the price . I don't think its really made to be a support style bra though . I'm very happy with it especially for the price and am gonna order the blue ."
4.0,"It's a Christmas gift and won't be opened by the recipient till December 25th.<br />It looks fine to me, the giver.😊"
4.0,"I like this a lot. However, it doesn't look as nice as it does in the picture shown. It's much more casual than I expected. But it's nice if you're not trying to get too dressed up or you work in a more casual office setting like I do. I ordered the XL and it fits as expected."
4.0,"Like them but not for anything you have to bend down for, they slide off your butt. Mesh seems kinda fragile but I have squatters legs so that maybe putting more stress then normal"
4.0,"The earrings are cute, but smaller than I imagined. They were a gift and the recipient loves them!"
4.0,These shorts are great as an undergarment. Like under shorts in the summer and leggings for the winter. The only bad thing about these is that they are not as opaque and will easily reveal your underwear if your wear them alone. They also do a great job of protecting my privates when im biking so the cushioning was amazing.
4.0,"I love almost everything about this top, I did not have any bleeding red color anywhere after washing. The fit and style are just so cute and simple. My only complaint is that my long sleeves are pouffed at the end of the shoulder, right on the biceps and snug from the elbow to the wrist, this is honestly a little weird looking, I don't quite understand why this is as I have only worn this item 3 times. The fabric feels very much worth the quality, the question is, will the shape be worth a darn after more use."
4.0,"Great summer bag! Love the pattern, only downside is there are not enough compartments to organize your stuff, I wish there was just one big enough for my phone 📱"
4.0,Sent this bracelet to my son who is in The Navy.  He really likes it but told me the clasp doesn't hold that well and it comes undone frequently.  Otherwise he is very happy with quality.
4.0,This is a unique groovy necklace.  It must be worn with the right outfit however.  Something rather tame would really allow the groovy necklace  to shine!
4.0,"if you’re like me and have medical issues, wearing that bracelet gets to be really annoying and very much obvious to where people are like 👀. This is so easy to use and is so much more appealing!!! Definitely worth the money!<br />My only issue was that when you enter your information that it’s just on the internet attached to your name. so if my name was googled, my medical stuff would pop up under the MyID site."
4.0,"I love the shirt, but it is advertised as a sweatshirt - and that is not what it is.  It is a silky material.  I like it so I am keeping it rather than send it back, but just know it is not the usual kind of sweatshirt."
4.0,"I sized up because of other reviews, and it is perfect! I usually wear it as a cover up since it does show a pretty significant amount of side boob if I wear it alone. I am 5'3&#34;, 110 lbs, 32C, and I got a medium (I am normally a small). It is not super short which I like (goes to mid thigh), but I am also short so it might be really short on a taller person. And there will be some side boob for anyone bigger than an A cup I would say. Definitely size up 1 or even 2 sizes."
4.0,Comfortable for lounging around but not so good for an active day running around.  They bunch up a bit and get a little annoying.
4.0,"Material is a little thinner than i expected from the other reviews, but it fits nicely!"
4.0,"Nice lightweight, fun color capris. Slightly see through but as long as you wear a light colored underwear it’s not an issue."
4.0,The neck piece is very comfortable. It is a bit long for my son who is 10.
4.0,They came on time and they're cute. They just won't go in my lobes due to the flairs being too wide.
4.0,"Beautiful but just after 3 wears, the earring especially has shown signs of discoloring which is so disappointing. That said, this is very attractive and I received so many compliments."
4.0,"This necklace is a fun costume jewelry piece.  You know it's a hit because every time I wear it, strangers compliment me on it.  4 stars because it was broken when it arrived, but it was a 5 minute fix at the local jewelry repair shop."
4.0,"I really liked , is elegant, very beautiful, the price does not appear . As along the belt, keep in mind that any brand of watch you buy this, always going to have to adjust the straps depending on the type of wrist. I hope the color, stones and operation, with proper care can last me a while."
4.0,"although i think is a bit pricey ,i love it , it would be more comfortable if it had side buttons for the mask"
4.0,"I like the style, and look. The size is to big."
4.0,"This is a great bag for travelers and others who like a larger size and lots of pockets. However, for my purposes, it turned out to be a bit too big and a bit too heavy, so I returned it with regret."
4.0,The bracelet looks beautiful on my hand.<br />Characteristics<br />The beads are woven such that it feels like a big bunch of flowers.<br />The colors look pretty and give it a floral theme.<br />Opening of the bracelet expands easily to fit to one’s hand size (see attached pics).<br />It is hand made yet not wobbly like other handmade sets that you get in market.<br />The product is very good for the price.<br />It is a nice bracelet to wear for birthday parties and special occasions.
4.0,"My wife ordered this, and wants to cut the bottom shorter."
4.0,"They are very Beautiful,one of the bracelets broke as I was taking them off."
4.0,It does have a some what stretchy material. It fits real nice. I weight 150 and I’m 5’3 I ordered a medium. The dress is made to be tight at the bottom that is the only thing I don’t like about the dress besides that it’s a must have
4.0,"Very nice but too small, Gave them to my young daughter."
4.0,"nice shirt, breathes well and works great as a base layer"
4.0,"Nice little gift for girl | woman who loves to read; especially a librarian!  Length of chain is about 20 inches.  Since I have trouble with clasps, that's important... this slips over my head."
4.0,"Good tool. Easy to use, store and carry around. Big time saver good buy. Ballerina all should get them. Trust me!"
4.0,Purchased for my daughter for Christmas. She loves it. But it does fit a little snug. I'd suggest purchasing one size larger than normal.
4.0,Love the feel and weight of these. Black pair was smaller than grey ones.
4.0,"If you are looking for some joggers that are in trend with the overall style as of late, then these joggers get the job done. They are lightweight, so be cognizant of that. I was hoping for a little bit more weight to them, but living in the south, their lightweight, breathable material just means I can wear them year-round now instead of just in cooler months.<br /><br />They fit as expected and are comparably priced to other outlets."
4.0,For cheap sunglasses these are actually pretty awesome.
4.0,Super cute. A little chinsy or I would give 5 stars.
4.0,Nice glasses. But they are slightly heavier than I expected. The item states they are polarized.  Mine are not.
4.0,"I had an original in my teens. I loved that watch. So, I was super excited when I saw these for sale. My excitement was a bit diminished when I opened the box. I really don't remember these being so small. Were they bigger in the 80's or am I not remembering them correctly? Still, cool to have one again."
4.0,I usually take an extra large but these were tight
4.0,It's a beautiful shirt it was just too big.
4.0,"I would say this is really true to size. I am 5,4” and 185#. I ordered a large and it’s a good fit. Maybe could have gone a size smaller, but I am very solid and tend to be smaller than my weight would suggest. I am happy with the large.<br /><br />This suit has simple and cute styling with a really comfortable racer back, sturdy zipper they stays up, cute color accents, and three pockets across the back that are perfect. It’s very comfortable on.<br /><br />It does not have much compression which I would prefer. I wear mine with a sports bra and compression swim briefs underneath but have also gone with no panties. I just prefer a little more compression in my lower abdomen.<br /><br />The suit did not billow or drag in the water and the chamois was not even noticeable. It dries quickly!<br /><br />The chamois is very thin and kind of perforated so it dries very fast and it isn’t bulky at all. I thought it might be not as good for biking, but really it’s as adequate as my biking shorts with thicker chamois for a 20k or so ride. I haven’t run in the suit very much, but so far I haven’t had any discomfort from the chamois while running.<br /><br />Overall, I think this is a great entry level suit and a really great value. I’m definitely happy with my purchase. My only suggestion for improvement would be slightly more compression through the torso."
4.0,"Reviews are right - it's nicely plush, but if you're even somewhat thin it is way too big. I'm a large & ordered the small size which is still too big. I will keep it and try to have some of the bulk tailored out."
4.0,"I really like the color and details of this boy's shirt which is dressy enough to wear alone for a wedding or special event. I also like the versatility of being able to roll up the sleeves and button them in place for a more casual look. I was anticipating this feeling like one of my husband's dress shirts but the fabric is a bit rougher than that, almost like a nubby linen. It's well-made and I appreciate that there aren't any loose threads or seams which I keep finding with online clothing orders. It seems a bit narrow so you might want to order a size up depending on your child's build."
4.0,I like the simplicity and style of this dress
4.0,"I read reviews and saw that other customers said the band for this watch was large. That is one reason I bought it because my wrists are broad. It was large even for my wrists. I took it to a jeweler and had 2 links removed and it is fine now. The watch is an attractive watch and has worked well for me so far. I've only used it about two weeks, but have no reason to believe that it will not work well. I like it because I can use it with both gold and silver jewelry.  I consider it a good bargain."
4.0,Didn't care for material of dress. Nice
4.0,"The gloves are beautiful and seem to be well made, however, they seem to run small. Otherwise, I am satisfied with my purchase."
4.0,"This shirt is super cute! However the area between the top two buttons gapes open. I actually have this shirt in black from a different seller/brand, which is the same size (L) and it fits perfectly and doesn’t gape. I returned this white one and am going to try a larger size to see if that helps. For reference I’m 5’4, 165 lbs, 38C, curvy/wide bottom."
4.0,Stunning dress! Sadly it’s huge! My daughter was so excited she had picked the dress out herself. I checked all the measurements on it and it looked like it might be a tiny bit loose nothing we couldn’t adjust. When it came in everything was perfect until we got to the torso. It’s huge. Easily a size or two too big on her. 🤦🏼‍♀️ She was so disappointed. We’re sending it back. Hopefully we will get our refund and can order her another dress and get it in before her next pageant.
4.0,Really like how comfortable this beanie is. It doesn’t take long to charge and I can wear it for hours during the day while working. Really love the duality of this product. It serves two purposes keeping my head warm and providing entertainment.
4.0,Laughed at myself because I put it on wrong at first- but this was a great buy!!!  Comes in handy at the beach!!
4.0,"As expected - very nice, high quality."
4.0,"Runs a tad big, like most people say. But in the 1920s dresses were supposed to fit loosely. &#34;Swing dress&#34; &#34;slip dress&#34; so I liked that aspect. I'm 5'5 160 ordered a size large the bust was a bit big. But I wore fur and it covered it! Id buy it again great deal really good beading on the dress. I was impressed"
4.0,The size of the circle and chain are just right. The letters are what I was looking for. The service was on target. I would have preferred a mat<br />finish.
4.0,"Timex has really up'd their aesthetic in recent years, this a prime example."
4.0,"I like the bag. It came in perfect conditions and fast. It is small with two compartments, the way I wanted it. The only part I am not happy about it is the strap. It is kind of short for me. I am 5’9”, so I wish it could be longer but I keep it."
4.0,I like the dress & the fit but it’s a bit too long. I am going to wear it to a wedding rehearsal dinner.
4.0,"I LOVE the variety but worried that the ear hooks would irritate my ears (not the best quality). But lo and behold, it works just fine.  Love, love it!"
4.0,Looks exactly like a Movado.  People have to look reakk close.  Finally a China made product worth using to impress friends
4.0,"Remember when you knew how to read a watch dial?<br /><br />I have been using digital watches most of my life. Using an analog watch was for dress. So did this watch meet my expectations. Yes, and more.<br /><br />I have the ""zebrawood"" style.<br /><br />I have two complaints. First, the dial is busy. So, the time is not immediately apparent looking at the dial. Second, the ""crown"" (button/pin used to set the watch) should have two settings (as per the book). Mine only has one. This means if something bumps the crown in moves the date (which is not clear anyway). There should be one more click to lock the crown. This also means I can not reset the stop watch.<br /><br />The watch is beautiful. I doubt it is wood. It's extremely light (like balsa) but extremely strong. It's even lighter than it would be if it were plastic. It seems to be varnished in some way, yet it doesn't seem to be varnish.<br /><br />Beautiful watch. Keeps good time. Don't expect the other things to function correctly. If I bought it in a store, I would have returned if for one that does function correctly."
4.0,"I’m a beginner cycler and was not expecting the discomfort associated with the bike seat. These bottoms had good reviews so I decided to get a pair. The biggest negative (for me) is that they are obvious under my work out pants. I wore a jacket around me waist when walking around in them because I was slightly embarrassed by what they looked like. They definitely take some pressure off your nether regions during, but I was pleasantly surprised that I was less sore the next day too. Unsure if I’ll buy another pair or opt for built in padding to a pair of pants."
4.0,nice gloves but ordered boots two days before the gloves and have yet to receive boots its been 15 days
4.0,they fit great around the waist and legs but when you get on the bike there isnt much leeway in the crotch area so the pants rise when you sit on the bike.  Not sure if its my body but I think there could be more give.
4.0,I am short and goes a couple inches over my feet. Still fits baggy.
4.0,it looks amazing i didnt open the packaging because this is a gift for my sister for Christmas who loves scarfs and pink  and cherry blossom so this was a perfect find for her.  i love the color looks amazing and i just hope she likes it the way i do.
4.0,Perfect. Only thing I noticed is in the picture it shows the sleeve having a fitted cuff where it would stay up on your arm. This shirt doesn't have thatZ you can tie it but it's not tight enough to stay up. Overall quality is perfect fabric is thick and beautiful. Very happy.
4.0,The pink one isn’t adult sized. It’s like a youth or teen size. It squishes my face.
4.0,"Fit was a bit small, but wearable."
4.0,Looks just as pictured the only thing bad is you need a lot of them because they're not going to stay in the end of them are so then they come out with ease like for real if you laugh too hard and your nose somehow Rises it's coming out when you go to sleep and wake up they're usually out so you're going to need a lot of them but they cute
4.0,"I really like this bag. It is the perfect, for lack of a better word,  &#34;storage&#34; bag. Not too deep or wide. It would be perfect if the straps were shoulder length."
4.0,"Love the dress. I ordered a large and could have done a medium. My only complaint is the buttons are so far apart and they gap in certain angles. The dress is oversized enough that the buttons could have just been for aesthetics. The material is a thick cotton, kind of like a t-shirt. I’m really loving this dress!"
4.0,Absolutely beautiful earrings. They are lightweight and look very beautiful. The color is as shown in the picture. Beautiful aquamarine color. The deducted star is because it says it is hypoallergenic but is not; they cause irritation on my ears after half and hour of wearing it. The solution is easy I placed a little bit of clear nail polish in the insert and problem solved.
4.0,They shirt is very cute. It is bigger than expected. Order a size below for better fit.
4.0,I’m a 22/24 and ordered a 3XL and it fit great. Just didn’t like the color i ordered  Wanted something brighter for summer. Would order again in another color. Length was great - 5’5”
4.0,"I wear a US size 10 - 12 so I would have ordered a large if I'd gone by the size chart. Based on other reviews stating this ran several sizes too small, I ordered a 2XL and it fits exactly like I want it to. It fits perfect in the bust and arms and is slightly roomy in the hip area. The material is very nice, but just be aware of the sizing issue with this dress."
4.0,These run very small. Definitely order the size group up. They are practically Asian child sizing
4.0,"Because of the way the heel is made on these he makes it real hard to get on, especially for people that have neuropathy in their hands and feet"
4.0,My daughter really loves this necklace.  The clover looks great and the necklace was high quality.  All around a good purchase.
4.0,"This shirt is very well  made. Buttons are sturdy and is very conformable to wear. It does however run a little small, normally an XL will fit me just fine, I am able to get the shirt buttoned however it is a tight fit."
4.0,This is a great quality watch for our first grader. She is learning to tell time at school and we wanted to have her continue to practice. It fits her well and keeps time appropriately. She loves the pink sparkles! There were some stickers in the box as well that she really liked.
4.0,"I guess I’m not use of it, still good"
4.0,"The bathing suit was beautiful and good quality material, I am 5'9 and 167 pounds, I ordered a large and it was way too small! Had to send back."
4.0,My five year old loves it
4.0,the quality of the fabric is quite good and i loved it
4.0,They looked much too big when I first opened them but after a wash they shrunk enough to fit perfectly
4.0,Fit was spot on for a nice relaxed fit top.  Not too tight but not too baggy.
4.0,"It was so beautiful, just as pictures, but it ran larger than the small I expected when I ordered."
4.0,I bought these to wear under my dresses for work. They ride up my legs...
4.0,"I like the purse a lot, however, I wish the straps were longer and it was easier to close quickly. The clasp has to be placed perfectly for it to turn closed."
4.0,Got this for a friend she loved it
4.0,I like these capris.  They are comfy!  They do show sweat so not necessarily ideal for high cardio unless you don't care.  ;)
4.0,"Nice boots, but run real small. I ordered 1 size larger and they barely fit. I should have ordered 2 sizes larger."
4.0,"Cute, great size, wish it had more color options though."
4.0,"Very cute, reasonable quality for price."
4.0,"It doesn't billow on me, but still a lovely skirt."
4.0,Good 👍🏾👍🏾🙌🏽
4.0,"I ordered the same size mentioned by the first reviewer.<br /><br />This can fit an adult and the right size by label was delivered. But I think by style design, it's meant to hug the body snugly. It's not uncomfortable but I am glad I'm wearing a bra, otherwise it's a show for the guys.<br /><br />I think in time it will probably stretch out a little."
4.0,Definitely more like socks than nylon hose.
4.0,"It looks just like the photo, but the material is super thin and cheap feeling. Hey, I spent $5 on the dress so I plan to keep it, but its real thin."
4.0,This dress is so beautiful. I loved wearing it. It is see through but you can't tell if you wear black undergarments.
4.0,Size fits well. Not as low rise as i thought they would be.
4.0,Broke kinda too easy.
4.0,"Good fit, I got the XL but it ran a little small, I recommend a size larger. Still very good quality product, would buy again."
4.0,Fit was somewhat small but thankfully I read reviews and ordered a size up.  I &#34;fringed&#34; the bottom and it turned out really cute.
4.0,"Nice bag,"
4.0,This was a cute costume for the price!! It was comfortable too. I wear a large but went with the extra large and it fit like a large.
4.0,Best feeling exercise capris I've owned!
4.0,I love matching with my daughter
4.0,"Very soft. Stayed put on wrist. Zippered slit fit a house key, credit card and asthma inhaler."
4.0,I bought these socks for party favors for my daughter's 13th birthday party. They were ultimately a huge hit! The girls loved them.
4.0,Para el precio estan muy bien.
4.0,"They fit real well, nice and snug. Unfortunately there is no fly opening so when I need to relieve myself, I have to drop my draws."
4.0,Training my grandson
4.0,"Super cute! For some reason I thought it was silver but it’s gold. Beware, it tarnishes very easily so keep away from water, etc."
4.0,These actually looked nicer than I expected for the price.  Made nice gifts.
4.0,Really cute and fits as expected BUT the flag color is a bit dull. Would recommend but not for a shirt you are wanting to take a pic in.
4.0,Liked the heat.
4.0,great for every day wear.. and well made.  a great variety of colors which I enjoy.
4.0,Good watch. It serves its purpose.
4.0,Good vibe. I like the bracelet just seems to be getting looser and makes me nervous it will break.
4.0,"This is a lanyard, not shoes!"
4.0,Looks nice.  Frame a little wobbly
4.0,"Fits well, material ok but could be a little better made"
4.0,my only issue is the empty space between the hat and my forehead that i dont get in other dad style hats
4.0,"It's a nice warm jacket. 14 year old likes it. A medium is a little big for him, but he's long and skinny so needed the larger size for arm length and room to grow."
4.0,Loved this dress... very sexy.  Didnt like the neck line so i cut itm)
4.0,"These seem sturdy enough, as hose go. I always seem to get runs in mine, but I scraped against a wooden bench and didn't get one in these. It's not saying much, but I was surprised they didn't run.<br /><br />I am pretty tall (33&#34; inseam) so they took some work to get all the way up, but were otherwise fine."
4.0,Material looks kinda cheap but fit perfectly
4.0,I wish the material was a bit more stretchy or something that hugs the curves a little more but all in all very nice.  Exactly what I was looking for.
4.0,"I'm glad I took advice of others and ordered this jacket. I got the 1X and it fits perfectly, and value was right for my budget. I gave it a 4 star because it's not even a week since I got it and the lining inside the pocket is already torn! I'll have to see if it'll hold up during my New York trip."
4.0,"The length was OK but I have very narrow feet so the strap across the top of foot is a little too big for me..I have a pair of regular Crocs and have no problem with them for I mostly wear them with socks..but these flip flop style I can't do that I will keep them because they are great for water and just getting feet wet...just wish I could shorten the top of the foot strap, or shorten the toe post."
4.0,Laces are way too long to fit any size shoe unless you plan on lacing up your ankles...
4.0,Great fascinator for the price
4.0,Cool shirt. Light and comfortable. Slim cut though. Only reason I didn't give 5 stars.
4.0,"This is such a cute dress! The material is thin but not see through. The only reason I am returning it is because I ordered 1 size bigger. I thought it was going to be the ticker material like the other AX Paris dresses I have. I also wish they had more colors or patterns. Overall, cute dress for the price and it fits TTS. I would totally buy again in my correct size. For reference, I am 150 and size 8 fits like a glove."
4.0,"The hat does the job and wicks away sweat pretty well. It also doesn't seem to drip as much as other hats I own when it is saturated. That said, it doesn't dry all that quickly. It's also a bit thicker than some lighter hats, though that doesn't seem to be a detriment to performance.<br /><br />My main criticism is with the sizing strap being a floating pressure type. It works, holds its spot while wearing and allows for incremental changes. But I find myself always having to adjust it, as it easily slips (especially when the hat gets washed). I'd prefer an elastic band, personally, as opposed the pressure clip."
4.0,"Good buy, my son loves it."
4.0,Material is thing but fits well. Not something to wear on a cold day.
4.0,"First of all, these run true to size which I really appreciate. They are soft and comfortable. The lace hasn't stayed in the greatest shape, but it's by no means poor quality, I am very pleased with the quality for the price."
4.0,"Waist length and it shrinks a little, even when washed in cold water and tumbled on air dry. Arms are snug."
4.0,Loved this dress...
4.0,Very nice and comfy.  I may buy more now I know my size.
4.0,Stiffer and smaller than expected.
4.0,"This design was very well defined on the mask. The mask fits well but the elastic string tends to pull on the upper part of my ears. That may be user error though, more testing required."
4.0,Decent quality for price point. Have yet to see how well it wears for an active toddler!
4.0,"Well crafted.  No lining, and does not stretch."
4.0,"It's ok for my trip up North this Christmas, I was expecting it to be a little longer."
4.0,"We have bought these in the past and I could swear the quality is not the same. Not bad value for the money but the fit in the seat is wrong and the stitching in this area is ""larger"" than the old suits. Lasts about a year in a pool/spa daily environment. My husbands suits, however, last eight years. What's with that?"
4.0,"this jacket is well made and very pretty ,however  it is made small."
4.0,"Cute, little turkey earrings that will be perfect to sport during the holidays. Thanksgiving often gets overlooked so I was happy to see these online. My only wish is that they were a little bigger which is why I took 1 star."
4.0,Not the worst.
4.0,Loved how it fit me. Material was super soft. I also got the matching top. Only thing is that it ripped a little when I was squatting the first time I wore it. #thicgirlproblems
4.0,"love the sunglasses and faster shipping than what was estimated, only downside is, they came with a few scratches on the lens :(  other then that, I'm very pleased with them!"
4.0,These glasses are very comfortable. Well made.  You cannot return them easily. You have to contact the actual company. The color of the lenses make everything look brownish which I do not like.
4.0,"the material is thinner than I thought it would be, it looks a little thicker in the ad pic. it's a nice material tho, definitely a summer outfit. the shape is cut in a triangle, very narrow at ankles- stretchy material. will be wearing it today to church, (Mary-like crusade = nothing 2&#34; below hollow of throat, long sleeves, below knees-preferably to ankles, loose fitting), I need to purchase a long sleeve maxi undergarment to wear beneath..."
4.0,Nice material<br />Little big<br />It would be nicer with pockets at side
4.0,"Great look, awesome fit, poor quality.<br />I guess it's what you get for the price.<br />I'll post later how they last."
4.0,"Perfect to keep the wind out of my ears while riding our bike.<br /> Love the velcro for a proper fit.<br />Neck piece runs small, to snug without  any give."
4.0,"I like them but they are &#34;short shorts&#34; and more like a swimming suit bottom, don't go down very far on your legs."
4.0,"My glasses arrived w tiny micro fractures. They ARE beautiful and so shimmery, I’m wearing em anyway. I’m not sure it’s worth returning to get a new pair, the fractures don’t impededmy vision and aren’t super visible. I just hope they don’t get worse fast or ill be sad. These are then funenest glasses I’ve purchased ina while. I’m usually a Rainbowoptx girl."
4.0,Everyone said to go up sizes I'm 34d size 4/6 woman's I got a large and it is definitely huge in the middle and neck . I would not suggest going up two sizes stick with your size or maybe one size up tops for heavy chest . If you're my size you could go for a medium like I wish I did . The material also is not exactly like what the model is wearing. She is wearing a cotton or linen like material that crinkles. I really loved the design . These would look great with leggings or skinny jeans
4.0,Lovely casual shirt dress with pockets!!. Thick material. I think i ordered up a size from my usual. Reaches 2 inches above knees. I am 5'3&#34;.
4.0,These are a bit larger than a different style from this company but still cute and well made.
4.0,"Ordered a 7/8, but fit like a 6"
4.0,Cute for the money.
4.0,Super quick delivery. Looks just as pictured. A little snug in the chest area. Would prefer a little looser to wrap around when unexpectedly chilly.
4.0,It’s roomy. I can breathe.
4.0,Very cute and a nice size. just wish the chain color was lighter
4.0,"The V-neck is a little lower than expected, but the fit, comfortable and easy flow of the dress definitely makes up for it!  Flats or heels, a great little dress to have."
4.0,"This shirt feels cool and soft on the skin.  Its breathable and lightweight.  The color is true to the photos in the description.  Its not something I would normally wear, but was in need of some new shirts.  This shirt is going to be great in the summer."
4.0,Super cute mask and worked perfectly for my batgirl costume. Only down side is I never felt like it shaped my face to lay flat.
4.0,My son has been wearing this since Christmas. I believe the craftsmanship is appropriate for the price and I would definitely purchase again.
4.0,"Love!  I am 5'6 140LB bought a large.  I wear a camisole under it, the reveal is just a bit much for me.  (shy, and a working women)  Hangs great on my frame and disguises the muffin top!  (we all love that feature!)  I have machined washed it twice, but only line dry it. Holding up great!"
4.0,[[VIDEOID:cdc9d5133dc20d17791802869004ebf6]] Since my daughter hasn’t worn them because they’re for Christmas I didn’t give 5 stars but I love these shoes. They are stylish and very durable and the speed of light changes and has multiple colors. They also remind me of Nike Roshes
4.0,It is very lite weight.
4.0,I sent it back as it didn't fit right. It was well made and the colors were terrific
4.0,Cute shoes and fit as expected. I dropped a star because the Velcro doesn’t always stay together.
4.0,Love it! 4 stars because it comes loose easily..
4.0,I really liked it.......it is a pity it fell apart.
4.0,"it was overall p good, if you put it in the wrong place it might hurt after a while and the magnet could be stronger but it works well and i was able to change the spikes fine"
4.0,"These fit great,  look great but slide down a lot."
4.0,"The material seems to be good quality.  I ordered the blue ones.  I like the color but the strings are a little yellow.  They were a little short on me and tight in the back .  I ordered a medium, but  should've ordered a large.  I didn't realize how much weight I had gained since weaning my daughter.  I am 5'4 and weigh 134.  I gave them to my daughter who is 5'2 and weighs 120 pounds.  They fit her great!"
4.0,I love them but I washed them once and one of the straps fell off!! Kind of bummed but I would buy again! Will fix just a pain!!
4.0,"I usually wear a small (5'5"" tall, 25"" waist). I ordered both Small, XSmall, and had to return them. The XXSmall fits like a small, so that is the size I kept. After finding the right fit, they were worth the effort. They are well made with a sturdier material than most leggings, almost like a cross between leggings and pencil fit slacks. They look nicer than regular leggings, but feel just as comfortable."
4.0,Not as nice as I expected.  Was too large for an 8 year old.
4.0,Love them but when I wanted to wear the army green it was broke. that was the one I bought the pack for.. ugggh the others are nice too and very soft and comfortable
4.0,Great price and ok quality. The clip doesn't always stay together. They're not as strong but still look adorable and nice size
4.0,I bought this item as an anniversary gift for my husband.  I was very pleased to find something<br />a little off for him as thats how he is.  He absolutely loved the gift and it arrived ahead of schedule<br />which was perfect because i actually ordered fairly late for our anniversary.  I would recommend<br />this company as the ordered did arrived early and was packaged well.
4.0,Very smushed when I got it. Had to re shape. But he's happy so I'm happy.
4.0,It works OK no complaints I would never use this hiking the material is really cheesy I only use this as a day bag/go bag.  If you want a hiking backpack don’t be cheap
4.0,"The good: absolutely beautiful and it seems very high quality! Such pretty fabric. Great if you are petite!<br /><br />The bad: not great if you're not petite. I am 105 pounds, 5'5&#34; 32C. It was about 1/4&#34; too short for me. I will still wear it, but I will have to wear it with flats and hope no one notices that it's somewhat short. It fit everywhere else wonderfully. I personally did not love how the top was cut, very modest neckline, maybe a tad too modest when you don't have a lot of chest. I figured out a way to make that work too.<br /><br />Overall: beautiful, quality dress at a low price and with a few slight modifications will work just perfect for me. I would definitely buy again, if I was 5'4&#34;. :)"
4.0,I got this for a wedding I’m in and I like the dress and it fits great except the boob area the boob padding is so hard and stiff it looks funny on not to mention that the boob part is up really high where your boobs shouldn’t be. Other than that I really like the dress and I will make the boob thing work.
4.0,These are comfortable.  The waist band is a little to wide and tends to roll over. Other then that they are soft and comfortable.  I prefer the modal fabric for lift and for comfort. This was a free sample and I ordered another 4 pairs they since they appear to be durable. I like the feel but they could be more like the modal fabric design. The slimmer elastic waist bad on the modal do not roll but these do. I probably will continue buy the modal fabric versions in the future. I also like Bamboo fiber briefs and trunks. For those I have bought other brands. The Lapassa Brand products are good quality and have good customer support.
4.0,Easy to wear and look good on love the color
4.0,Love this dress! This is my favorite dress that I own now. Wore this dress yesterday to work and it was so comfortable. The fir of this dress is great it doesn't hang to long and isn't to tight on me. Got this dress to wear for the rest of summer and to transition into fall. Love that this dress can be dressed up or down. Highly recommend.
4.0,"Though they do not work for the sheers in the cats' room, they are so beautiful I am leaving them up."
4.0,It will shrink as I expected cuz it is 100% cotton highly recommend getting a size bigger
4.0,"Fit pretty well, a tiny bit small. Not enough that I would go down a size, though. I'm 5'3&#34; and 38DD. I ordered a large, so busty women may want to order a size up for comfort's sake. A couple people said the zipper was annoying, but I didn't even notice it. IT HAS POCKETS! I must not have read that before so that was awesome. I'm all for pockets. Especially pockets that can actually hold things. However, the left pocket opening was over sewn? I can't put my hand in it without effort and have to hold the skirt down when I take my hand out. (Which is why it lost a star)."
4.0,"It looks kind of silly, when I pull my alpaca wallet from my fancy designer bag, but it's fun! The print is not as nicely position as on the picture and that takes one star out of my review."
4.0,"The dress is really feminine. It has a side zipper. Just wish it came in larger sizes: XL, XXL. The Large is snug."
4.0,These pants are made BIG. Went down two sizes to get the right length for my tall daughter but the waist was still huge.<br />It’s a shame because I liked the fabric. Might work better on a heavier child.
4.0,I love the look and shape.  Only wish it were a little more sturdy. (Thickness/weight).  I would have been happy to pay for the extra grams.
4.0,Just a standard tank. I love it and it's comfy.
4.0,I ordered an XL based on the size chart and it ended up being like a dress on my daughter. We decided to use it as just that and threw on some leggings with it. Turned out fine.
4.0,Nice heavy sweater!
4.0,Super cute for a quick trip into the store. For adults they will just cover above the nose & below the chin.<br /><br />For teens it might fit better.
4.0,"It is beautiful.  Of course the ring is not for me, so I can not rate its durability; however I buy jewelry all year long, and this one is a KEEPER!!"
4.0,"I really love the unique style of these earrings. I received my product much sooner than I expected since they come from Thailand. I was somewhat disappointed about their appearance during wear. I am only guaged to a size two. At this size it is very difficult to notice the detail of the jewelry during wear. It almost appears as if you are just wearing black plugs. Still, I love this set and I am happy to have bought them :)"
4.0,"I am 5'5'', 125lbs, and I bought a medium. I am not very fit, just skinny by luck. BUT i have big thighs - so i'm thinking I should have gotten a large. It is tight around the leg holes, so it makes my thighs look even bigger. Also, as other reviews have stated, this is difficult to put on because of the shape.<br /><br />However, i knew all of this before i bought it, and i still bought it. This is a novelty piece, i'll wear it during 4th of July or big party weekends at the lake because i get so many compliments on it. I just don't wear it every weekend sort of thing."
4.0,Pretty nicely made.  But they need earring backs to stop them from falling out
4.0,Very nice earrings. Matches a necklace I have.
4.0,The large I ordered is a little tight in the bust BUT I'm an F cup so that's to be expected. Otherwise the dress is very comfortable & the pockets are everything. I gave 4 stars because the seam is right down the middle front of the dress which is odd but for $20 I'll buy other colors.
4.0,perfect for what I bought it for!
4.0,"I really like the design of this bag and the look of it. There are some serious pros and cons that I will mention to help you make your decision in purchasing this purse.<br /><br />1. It's heavy and stiff. I found having to move the Satchel flap up and down inconvenient as it's a two hand requirement due to stiffness and it slowed me down quite a bit.<br /><br />2. There's not as much room inside as you would think. The interior depth is about 2 inches which cuts back on organizational space.<br /><br />3. After one week of use, and that is very light use, the finish on the brasses are already rubbing off showing a grey plastic.<br /><br />4. This bag looks like real leather and is very stylish. I received many compliments on it and can wear it many different ways. I like the versatility<br /><br />5. For the price you can't beat it, especially if you don't mind cumbersome bags<br /><br />6. It appears to be well made other than the brass finishes."
4.0,Very pretty however I lost 2 because the prongs loosen very easily
4.0,I'm 5'5 and I bought a large thinking it might fit well as a dress and tie up but I should've gotten an extra large. Either way it is still very nice
4.0,"Highly recommend. This is a military classic with a manual winding. A nice-looking watch with bright lume (see pics). Don't worry about the size, especially if your wrist has a flat shape.<br />The only drawback is a low quality strap. I changed it to another, handmade."
4.0,They work well only thing is when cleaning they get small scratches very easily
4.0,Bought this for the extended life using it in a pair of heated gloves for winter.  The top has changed where it does not have a groove for the cord to fit it.  Other than that it seems too work well.
4.0,Was very cute thought kind big! lol
4.0,"Thin, breathable material. Easy to dress up or makes a cute casual look. I typically wear a size 18 and their largest size (XXL) was too small for me. Gave to a friend who wears a 13/14.  Fit perfectly"
4.0,I bought this for my granddaughter's recital and she loved it.  She is five so it is hard finding a bracelet to fit. This was great .
4.0,"My husband used these for an Ash Ketchum Cosplay and they worked out great. He is 6&#34;2 and they fit just fine. Only downside is that they appear to just be cut off at the fingers, but didn't really seem to effect the overall look."
4.0,"Very comfortable and retro. Not wild about the material of the heel, but not a show stopper...and I suspect it's what makes it so comfortable."
4.0,This robe is good for the very warm/hot weather but it is a little thin.  After a shower it does not help absorb water like you would expect a terry cloth robe to do.
4.0,Cute and easy to put on
4.0,I always get extra warranty on everything that I buy
4.0,These gloves are warm and comfortable. The only drawback is how quickly the fuzz balls begin to form.
4.0,"These socks really are more orange in color (somehow on my monitor they look reddish).  These are comfortable to wear, offers just enough compression to give it a snug feel, and teh extra raised back of the foot will help reduce chaffing while the low sides helps to keep it near invisible to be worn as no show socks.<br /><br />The stretch on the socks makes it quite flexible, being to fit from women's #6 to men's #11, though size 11 is definitely the max."
4.0,Love the color and feel. The nose pieces are not quite the same as the originals to me otherwise would be 5 stars.
4.0,Very good price for a Michael Kors bag.  Good summer tote.
4.0,"Really fun and light evening dress. I'm 5'5, 125 lbs and ordered an xsmall. The color is beautiful, emerald green (you cant tell in the pictures). Only down side is the top cuts way low so you have to make sure to keep the girls in check."
4.0,It's a great gift! Unique and beautiful
4.0,It’s a nice looking jacket. Fits as expected
4.0,These fit a bit loose compared to the other brand I buy.  At first they did not stay up well.  i discovered that dry skin caused them to slide down some.  They are more comfortable in the foot and at the toe than my other socks and do the compression job well enough for my needs.  i will buy more.
4.0,It's super cute retro style. I read people has had problems with the straps. I haven't had a problem and have worn it a few times.
4.0,Needed for a funeral. I’m not busty so the top was a little loose but a great dress. Nothing fabric tape can’t solve.
4.0,"Very slow shipping. Good fit and comfy.. I got the skin color, thought it would be beige but it's more pink. Overall I am happy with the product"
4.0,Liked the gloves but the cream colored gloves had one of the finger holes sewed shut.
4.0,"For a costume, this is a good product, but the fabric is a cheap quality fabric and almost feels like paper. Ok for the price."
4.0,"Great sundress or poolside cover up. Not see through. Very comfortable. Only negative: It hangs lower in the front than in the back, not leveled well. Poolside or house dress makes for a better outfit"
4.0,I would definitely recommend this slim wallet. The magnet on it is ridiculously strong and works well. My only qualm is that it is tight so I can't carry as many cards with me. Also the middle portion is very tight as well. I've tried sticking 4-5 credit cards in it over night a few times to try and stretch it out and that seems to work. Overall I really like it!
4.0,"The fit was fine, I didn't realize it was a 2 piece so I had to send it back because the blouse is just too small, almost cropped really"
4.0,"I got these to go with a 19th century costume. They work fine, but the cable temples take some getting used to."
4.0,"I normally wear a size 12/14, so I ordered the XL not knowing it was going to be the equivalent of a US size 10/UK 14. That being said: it still fit, and it was also very cute on! It’s very thick material that has good stretch to it while not being cheap looking. I’m not going to lie, though: I was super excited about the pockets, and they are abysmal at best. You can maybe fit a tube of chapstick in them, which is incredibly disappointing. I’m still going to wear the dress because it’s very cute and figure flattering, but the lack of good pockets is a huge bummer.<br /><br />If the pocket thing isn’t an issue- the dress itself is lovely, and I don’t regret buying it!"
4.0,"The material is thin and will require undergarments to hide imperfections, but otherwise decently made. I’d suggest going up one size for maximum comfort. The dress is super clingy and the bust area & mermaid portion can be a bit snug if you’re buying your usual size. Also, glad that the material is not that shiny polyester that is typical of Amazon dresses in this price range. Will update when I wear it. Btw, I’m 5’4”, 190lbs and usually wear an XL, but had to send that one back."
4.0,"This was a great last minute costume. It was really simple. It slips over the head, and you can wear anything under it. The only small issue I had was that part of my puzzle piece was not very stable and kept flopping around, making it a little cumbersome to take pictures, but it worked out well. I would suggest this product."
4.0,"i thought it ran a little small for a xl size person, will try using it."
4.0,"Shipping time was great! Product was new. Shoes were recommended by my doctor. Takes a little while to get use to the feel. Not the most comfortable shoe, but does take the pain away."
4.0,"They protect, but don't prevent auto-clicks."
4.0,"The waist trainer is okay, the comfort is fine but it isn’t thick enough in my opinion."
4.0,This shirt really absorbs moisture.
4.0,This shirt looks good and feels great!
4.0,My daughter is 4'10 and 91 lbs but has larger boobs for her size. The small fits but not tight around the belly enough to be worn without straps. Pretty color though. And very cute on.
4.0,"This comes not as shown, color wise, flowers are larger than in the picture. True to size. Cute and comfortable."
4.0,Comfortable.  Wear to sleep in.
4.0,"I have a big head (7 3/4) and this hat is almost too big... pretty nice quality, but just a bit too big"
4.0,"Love the size. Love it. As a large headed mammal, it can be difficult for me to find a bandana that fits my oversized grape. These definitely fit the bill. I took off one star because the pattern is printed in such a way that after a couple of washings it is starting to peel off and feel crispy. Kind of a bummer as I really like the size and colors."
4.0,Always buy these for work. Very comfortable and look good with anything.
4.0,Nice mid priced belt Not as robust as my Bullhide Belts but excellent for everyday wear. I would not use this belt as a carry belt.
4.0,Sturdy suspenders
4.0,I'm giving them a 4 because there made of cheep plastic but they work for what I was needing them too. They fit a child's head. Like 3 and under they are tiny
4.0,These slippers are for size 5/6. My shoe size is 5 and I have wide feet. I wear these slippers with 2 pair of socks for extra warmth and this perfectly fits my needs. Even with 2 pair of socks there is extra room and my feet are not cramped. Exactly what I wanted.
4.0,"These slip shorts are comfortable and do not ride up. They run a little bit small, though. I would buy them again but maybe try the next size up. I am a size 2 and got the small."
4.0,Does the job. Sometimes the light will stay on even if it’s not charging though.
4.0,The fit runs small so take 2 sizes larger than usual
4.0,"I like this, but my iPhone doesn't fit if it's in an OtterBox."
4.0,THESE WERE OK I HAD TO ADJUST THE LENGTH OF THE STRINGS. THEY WORK GOOD
4.0,"I am 5'1'' and got a small, I wish it came in xs. The color and fabric is perfect! The feeling of it is very comfortable!! I need to wear a t shirt under it because the distance from the strap to the underarm is soo long. Without a garment underneath, the side of my bra shows... But I love the neckline! Only a little disappointing, not the end of the world though :)"
4.0,I think the kids will like this it's different
4.0,"Really liked this blouse! I use it with a camisole under and it fits well, not too long or not too short. I like the scoop neck, very flattering. I usually wear a medium and this size could be a little looser on me but it looks fine. It arrived in 2 days and with no wrinkles! You can't beat the price either."
4.0,"This waist trainer is nice a sturdy.  It seems to run a bit small but that's OK for me, more motivation to lose more weight. It fits comfortable.  It's made of good material because it's strong .<br /><br />I received this free or virtually so for product testing and review.

4.0,It’s beautiful but it runs small. It didn’t fit.
4.0,I have the LV MM and I got the medium size organizer. I used the size guide to help me pick a size. I should’ve gotten the large since it still has a huge gap inside my purse.<br />I mostly got this product to help me organize and help keep my LV in shape.<br />I suggest you get the large if you have the MM. Other than that it’s very nice and it has 8 pockets so it’s very convenient. I totally recommend it.
4.0,"Elizabethan-esque collar with this sack-dress.  The belt is a scrap of fabric you tie around, so unless you are an expert this dress can look rather shabby.<br /><br />I like it, not &#34;wedding appropriate like&#34; but I like wearing it around the house.  The collar is slightly ruffled/stiff/unexpected, but not too bad- just slightly itchy.  I do like how it flows."
4.0,"They are not as soft as I expected. They itch a bit, but keep my legs warm."
4.0,these do work but are a novelty quality and probably appropriate for the price.  Bought these and then went and bought some considerable more expensive that were a much nicer quality metal and feel.
4.0,"It's hard to find a romper or jumpsuit when you are short waisted, but figured in the camouflage print, any excess from the top would just sorry of blend in with the bottom/shorts. It just wasn't flattering for me."
4.0,"Just like the picture, great size bag, great material, very roomy. Only little little thing was that the &#34;Kenneth Cole&#34; was slightly crooked. No big deal though. Very pleased"
4.0,"This is a review for the Colombian Latex Short Torso Sports Workout Waist Trainer Cincher with 3 Hook Rows.  This arrives in plastic and when you take it out the latex smell is overwhelming.  The smell will seep into anything you have near it, so be forewarned.  I had to give it a couple of days to air out, and the scent faded so it did really help.  The hooks on it are strong, stronger then any hooks I have seen on a waist cincher.  It does run small and will be tight.  It will certainly train your waistline if you get the proper fit.  Mine is a little too small and I will have to shed some pounds before I will be able to use this, that and the smell makes it lose a star for me. I received this cincher as a promotional test product at a discounted testing price to use and review.  The stars I give are based off my own personal opinion and not any discount received.  This is my honest and unbiased opinion after receiving and using this cincher."
4.0,"The material is of good quality and I like that the skirt drapes and flows. What didn't work for me was the cap sleeves that make my arms look bulging and the shoulders look wide. May work well for a person with narrower shoulders, probably. I returned it because of this misfit, but am willing to try other Homeyee products given the quality and the overall design of this one."
4.0,Comfortable nice material but I ordered to big. The material is stretch
4.0,"I LOVE THIS DRESS! So many compliments. I'm typically an XL and this fits great except in the chest. The girls are really out there, which is fine - I just wore a scarf for a little modesty."
4.0,I loved the large pockets. Great for a cell phone or whatever if you want to go hands free. Fit is nice. It’s got a shape to it. It’s not loose or baggy but looks nice.
4.0,Flip flop more than I expected
4.0,"It’s not bad, just not used to mesh"
4.0,"Cute but runs small, especially the bottoms"
4.0,I needed a safety pin to feel comfortable in this dress. Overall loved the pattern and felt flirty and fun!
4.0,"This is a basic lightweight strap perfect for ukuleles of any size.  It is fairly comfortable.  It is a very basic strap, not fancy but it does the job.  I mainly use this strap with a tenor size ukulele."
4.0,These are absolutely adorable. The fabric is nice and soft the print is vibrant and as pictured. They do run on the small side though. My grandsons are average size in these or more than snug or should I say short in the sleeve and shorten the leg and waist length
4.0,I love these sandals. I had a pair that broke and I immediately replaced them with a new pair. Once they're broken in they're the most comfortable pair of sandals I own.
4.0,I always seem to have trouble finding hats that fit me because of my massive noggin. Glad I found this gem. Design is minimal and goes perfectly with any winter outfit. Good price too. Gave it 4 stars cause after 3 months of use the pom threading started coming loose. Nothing that a needle and thread can't fix though.
4.0,Love the bright color! The padding inside looked crinkly so I'm glad that I was able to take it out.
4.0,"Perfect for my Halloween costume. It’s a great length. It’s a bit snug, but not horribly so. The white is a tad see through (when is white not). I’d wear this again in a color, but probably not white as an actual piece of clothing."
4.0,Quality of the product seems good. My son is 6' 4 and when he raises his arms the shirt untucked.
4.0,there very pretty but they are to big for me
4.0,Very attractive and comfortable.  Easy to wash.  Fun to wear.
4.0,"I bought this for my son and he will grow into it, but the shirt I bought was a medium (and labeled as such) but is larger than my L and some XL shirts I own."
4.0,Great minimalist watch
4.0,"Love this product, but when I purchased on amazon was wondering if I got seconds because the fit was different than what I had purchased in the stores."
4.0,It's so cute and versatile. It just seems to run a little big and it's too sheer. I have to wear shorts and either a sport bra or cami under it which is disappointing. Otherwise it's durable and washable and cute.
4.0,"This top is slightly tight in the bust so if this is an issue, I would order one size up. The tree on the right is a very fuzzy image and I wish it was a sharper image as the other two are."
4.0,Just a little too tight at the top but they don’t bother me otherwise I love the look and feel.
4.0,"I liked this bralet so much I bought a second one in pink. Very comfortable. I wear between a C and D cup, and though it's not tremendous support, it's enough support I can wear it during the day, and soft enough I can sleep in it."
4.0,Very nice product. I wish they came in a smaller size though. They are what they say and it is definitely worth the money. I would buy again just a smaller size.
4.0,"This TaiPove Women Sexy Lingerie Lace Underwear Sleepwear G-String Outfit arrived a lot quicker than expected, which was great. I did not expect the best Lingerie coming from overseas, however, I was impressed. I ordered and XL,which was a size up from normal, and it actually fit pretty well. The one issue I did have, the underwire area kept going up and not staying in place around my chest (maybe I need to play with adjustable straps more). Otherwise, the main outfit, fit perfectly and looked great. I really like the color combo, pink and black, which is what drew me to this. The product is pretty much see-through, so be aware of that when buying. The quality of the Lingerie is actual pretty good, and should hold up, it is not overly thin like some others out there. One other slight issue, the thong that came with the outfit, was definitely a little large for me, but did still stay up and match perfect. Overall though, I am happy with my purchase! I received this item at a discount in exchange for my honest opinion"
4.0,Feels great on I love that it's 97%cotton and 3% spandex. I washed as it said hand wash and air dried it fits the same. Hard to steam out the wrinkles but that's cottonvery happy with this purchase
4.0,"Fit better if I lose 30lb. I do like it, the fit ok looks like what it supposed too in the picture. Recommend to wash cold water by itself. Dry side I recommend no heat."
4.0,Lots of slots for cards and bills. A lot better than signature wallets I've used
4.0,"Luv this dress I bought one in every color! I get tons of compliments on it! They are great dresses to travel with they dont get wrinkled!<br />I'm 5""5 150 large was perfect!!"
4.0,Comfy and fits pretty slim but long.
4.0,I love the sweater but wish it had a lining in it. The pockets dangle because there's no lining and people can see it. Otherwise it would be perfect.
4.0,This was fun- wore it on vacation until I lost it in a waterfall. Super cute.
4.0,My son loves the shoes...
4.0,Great shirts but I wasn't quite as built. That's on me. I'm 6 ft 1. 205 medium build. These are for yoked dudes.
4.0,"The bag is much bigger than I thought, delivery was on time, but I will be able to put more stuff in it."
4.0,"The gloves are perfect for driving, but accurate texting is not possible."
4.0,Beautiful. Arms too short and too too small. The dress wouldn't even come over my shoulders the arm holes were so tight. I had to have the sleeves removed in order to wear the dress. It was way way long. I am 5'6&#34; and I had 10 inches cut off the length. Other than those 2 issues the dress is well made and beautiful.
4.0,"Es bonita, comoda pero el celular quedo un poco estrecho y no me permite ajustar la tapa."
4.0,Little tight under the arms. Thin t-shirt fabric. Love the screen print.
4.0,"I bought these shields to slide onto my daily glasses to wear at work.  They do fit rather well on them. I am very disappointed in how stiff they are, they  dig into my skin a little bit."
4.0,"My husband is in desperate need for belts because he has ruined his older belts due to constant wearing. He needs belts that can be worn to work conferences and for casual dining. This belt is a really nice one. He instantly loved it. He loves how the color and pattern go hand in hand and how he could pair it with so many outfits.<br /><br />That being said, we will have to return it to get a bigger size. He wears size 34 jeans and we bought two belts, one a 34 and one a 36. Each were extremely too small. I am giving this belt a good review because it is a great quality belt but be aware to order a larger size. I will probably have to order a size 38 or even 40 because he could barely wrap it around his waist. Other than the sizing problem, I would recommend this belt and will have to buy more. * I received this product at a discounted rate for my true, unbiased review. Discount did not affect my review or opinion in any way.*"
4.0,"I am 36D with 45” hips and the L fits great. I just think the little cord could have been better, I might replace it by a larger ribbon to elevate the look. The material is just enough warm."
4.0,Nice piece the charm is really big
4.0,"I had to return them as they run small but they are a nice quality and if they had fit me, I would have kept them.,"
4.0,"Very nice band.  My wife loves it.  Removing the extra links was a little challenging, but the process was aided by the included link removing tool.  Be careful attaching to Gear Fit 2.  The band is a really close match, but not a 100%."
4.0,"Not a fan of how thin the fabric is...but, for the price, I can't really complain.  I bought a small and it's a little big on me (I usually wear a small).  It looks good with business casual or casual, so it's multi-functional on that level.  Not what I expected, but all in all, a good product."
4.0,"While I'm not overly large, I always order an XL in T-shirts so that I have room to move without restriction. This shirt is comfortable, but not as large as I'd like. Having said that, the shirt is of very high quality, and I particularly like the message on the back of the shirt rather than the front."
4.0,I haven’t had occasion to test it’s waterproof properties but like how it fits and the weight. I would have scored 5 stars if it had either pockets or pocket slots for access or pocket storage.
4.0,"The look and durability is good. It’s a little awkward where the strap attaches to the purse, kind of in the back of the purse instead of on the top like most purses. It hangs a little different because of this. But overall I really like it. It has a lot of different size pockets. I would recommend it."
4.0,I do really like them but seem a little small for my face. They also tend to slip a down my nose a little.  The day I was wearing them was very humid. I am going to try them again though to see it if it still happens.
4.0,Bought this for my boyfriend. I liked it but thought the lettering could have been better...neater?! It seems a bit made quickly.. or something. Lettering is even and straight  but sloppy. I wanna clip fringes but dont wanna f it up. It's ok.
4.0,"great glasses. i ordered a pair but they fell in the ocean. ordered another one and sat on them and they broke. both were my fault. but great glasses, correct prescription. if u take care of them they can last for a long time. 4 stars cus they bend easily if u accidentally sit or step on them. theyre plastic glasses. idk what i expected lol."
4.0,"Cute suit. Rather thin, but is all I needed for my son’s indoor swim class. The only reason I didn’t give it 5 stars is because there seems to be some wear ion the but after just one wear and he maybe sat down twice while practicing in and out of the water."
4.0,Nice light summer sweater.
4.0,"These are really cute, but a little big. I will order more when these wear out, just a half size smaller. :-)"
4.0,It’s stretchy
4.0,"Bought a my son's costume. Very nice quality, soft and nice details. Nicely made."
4.0,"Hard to rate this product, since it's the fit and style I'm reviewing.<br /><br />However, they broke two months later.  Could have been stress where the hinge was mounted to the frame.  Hard to tell if I snapped the  thickest part of the frame in half, of if the design is weak.  I liked them until the broke.<br /><br />Ordering another pair, since these fit my face really well."
4.0,"fit was okay. I have wide arms so it was slightly snug, but it will work. i'd say the fit is accurate if not slightly small. not so much to panic it won't fit, but enough that if you have a larger chest or some stomach to hide, may want to go up a size. it hides it all and keeps it decent either way. I do not think it would really work to wear as in the picture if you are taller than maybe 5'7 without soon becoming a crop top."
4.0,"The necklace is what I expected. It's got lots of little pieces, so it must have taken a while to assemble, therefore, the price was a very good deal. There's nothing special about the materials. It is what it is, but it looks pretty.  I'll be wearing this with a plain black dress for a formal-ish occasion, so it fits my needs. There's a big glob of glue that sticks out a bit on the back of one stone. I can easily fix that so it won't be scratchy. It came in a nice box. Overall, it was a good purchase."
4.0,It fits perfectly and go with my outfit that I I put together for the show.
4.0,"Very cute and flattering bikini, loved it despite it being a bit too loose. I would usually get a medium but based on reviews which suggested to get a size up, I went with large instead. It ended up being slightly bigger and looser than I expected so I definitely should have gone with my usual medium."
4.0,"Purchased for a friend to wear on a cruise. She is very large chested, I ordered “Size-L” and it fit her very well. It look super cute over her bathing suit."
4.0,"I purchased these for our daughter because she had begun using a baby walker, but wasn't getting much traction on our linoleum in just her socks - plus her socks would get dirty.  The grippy-circle on the toe helped her gain traction on the floors and kept her socks clean.  I gave them four stars because, like some other reviewers, I found they had kind of an odd fit, and could be difficult to get on our baby's feet.  Otherwise, good shoe, quality construction and materials."
4.0,"This is basically a thick leather strap with a buckle and one tanned side.  No frills.  No designs or stitching.  Just a good, strong belt.  I have no doubt this will last for years and years."
4.0,"Nice band. Only complaint I would have with it on the edges of the band, a little scratchy but that will probably go away with normal wear. Lugs and hardware are nice and solid."
4.0,"This is a great buy for Amazon, I got these for about $12!!<br />I am not a fan of white shoes in particular and the classic Primigi Mary Jane is very plain but the price couldnt be beat.<br />Make sure you measure your child and know your sizes, Primigi and other Euro brands can run either really large or very small. Great quality."
4.0,"Nice wallet, holds everything I want it to, and good to know my cards are secure! I purchased the red leather, it is a nice shade of red, not too bright, and the leather is very soft."
4.0,gift. she loves it
4.0,Fancy looking bag. The acrylic material is beautiful. Love the see-through look. The hardware is high-end looking and fashionable. Great for a night out.
4.0,It is very soft. The graphic is very sweet
4.0,Perfect for me because I have small wrist. Very nice set.
4.0,"Bought this for myself a while back and love it. Since then, a couple of friends expressed how much they love Aaliyah and I bought this jersey for them for Christmas. I know they're gonna love it."
4.0,Love just wish there was something or somewhere to put the exesive
4.0,Support is in medium range. Very comfortable...even for long periods of time.
4.0,This item fit as expected and was such a relief to have to support my ab muscles post delivery
4.0,White is a little see through but it’s a very pretty top.
4.0,Trailer hitch cover
4.0,Fit well and was a nice change to dress up my FitBit. Great option to have so it doesn’t look weird.
4.0,Got this to wear under maxi skirts.  I'm 5 ft 8 in and slip is still a bit long but I understand its fir a wedding dress so of course its long.  It provides great support.
4.0,Very comfortable cloth.  Soft and relaxing
4.0,It's a very nice wallet just a little smaller than I thought. It's definitely made for a young lady or a very small mini purse!
4.0,Gold belt is more of a penny color. But I love both belts. I usually wear them with a large shirt or dress.
4.0,I really like this product. There were some stitches popping out but no big deal. It has a more then normal size hoodie! I would recommend it for big hoodie lovers.
4.0,"Usually I have a big problem with the width when my feet swell, but with these I am gonna have to put a smaal pewice of elastic on each for when my feet aren't swollen. length they still touch my toes, and I wear a 91/2 and these are a 11/12. so you have to pick and choose . Me I would rather put a little elastic inside on the sides."
4.0,"Really like these shorts, ordered light blue and grey. They are the exact same color so that was disappointing. Make sure you do not put them in the dryer. After washing lay out to dry and you will have to steam or iron."
4.0,"I really love it, its cute and just like the picture. however, after a small amount of time, the silver part is starting to turn brown, kinda like its rusting. im very disappointed about the color change, but i still love the choker a lot. does anyone know how to turn it silver again??"
4.0,"It’s actually pretty cute, definitely runs small though. I wear a size 2 and ordered a small, it’s snug. I could use a little more room in the stomach and hip area. I’d try a medium if it wasn’t unavailable now."
4.0,I am very happy with these earrings. They are nicer then I expected.i would purchase from this seller again.
4.0,"Very nice, zI was pleased."
4.0,This works for removal of all types of watch links. Certainly saves time but you have got to have some basic knowledge about how watch bands are adjusted. Materials are a little cheesy but after some time to get used to it - it does the job.
4.0,one chain broke but I just took it off and kept wearing it. Cute costume necklace. :)
4.0,"I really like this top for wearing as a casual tank, but not for working out. It has too much nylon in it for me and that makes me sweat. LOL! That's why I give it a four star. However, this is a super cute, well made tank top. Very cute with denim shorts or jeans. Fits as expected too."
4.0,This is my first wallet that I have gotten in over a decade and I am very pleased with this product. I was worried about having enough room but this wallet has a just about perfect amount of space for my needs. I highly recommend.
4.0,Perfect for the party! I will need to secure the acrylic stones as they don't seem well attached...
4.0,"It bothers me that the new small is a medium. I don't like that the sleeves are so long that I have to roll them up a bit. That being said, I really like the sweatshirt. It is very warm and excellent for cold days."
4.0,A bit smaller than needed. I recommend ordering up!! Like if you need 6-9 order 12-18.. and so on..
4.0,just as it appears - it fits well
4.0,The tshirt fit as expected. I was surprised at the quality for the price - soft cotton and didnt shrink after washing.
4.0,"Great, comfortable motorcycle shoes. I even wear these for tradeshows and travel, as they really are quite comfortable. My only ding on the product is that the traction is not as good as I had hoped. Had a few surprises following a recent light rain where the roads were still slick, where putting my foot down for balance while on my bike had to be done carefully as to avoid losing traction. However, for dry weather riding, these are fantastic and I've pretty much stopped wearing much heavier, clunkier boots when I'm on the bike."
4.0,"It is really nice, I liked it it doesn't look too cheap."
4.0,"Great purchase for the price! It's not exactly as pictured, the shoulders aren't as full or ruffled BUT it still looks great and the fit is really flattering (5'3, 135 lbs and ordered a medium)"
4.0,"I love how great this fits, and the soft fabric. Love!"
4.0,"I’m glad I took another’s advice and sized up! I normally wear a size 9.5 and sized up to the 11. These are perfect for what I ordered them for-keeping them by the door to quickly slip on to take the pups out in cold/inclement weather. They are a little goofy looking-not sure I’ll wear them out anywhere, but I think they’ll be great even once there’s snow on the ground. Comfy enough, construction seems good. Glad I sized up for plenty of room and easy on/off."
4.0,"I purchased this in two colors. The one thing to really look closely at is the material. The dark gray one is more like a sweater material, it looks a bit more like a cardigan sweater than an actual sport coat.<br /><br />The red one is a completely different material, and definitely looks more like a sports coat.<br /><br />The reason I make the distinction, I did not catch that these may be different material/type based on the color. My expectation was the gray one would be the same material and style as the red, not a more stretchy “sweater” type material.<br /><br />That being said, I think it looks great with jeans. Just because it wasn’t what I expected, it doesn’t mean I don’t really like it. It looks very nice as does the red one. Just look closely at the material because the color apparently drives the style to a point."
4.0,"The Hemsut watch band arrived in a little box, which also contained 2 extra watch-band pins (20 mm) and a pin-removal tool. I've bought many replacement watch bands over the years (it's an inexpensive way to give old watches a new feel). For under $15, this a good value for the money. I suspect the genuine leather band will develop wrinkles and creases after several weeks of use, but this is typical of inexpensive watch bands. I would recommend this product to someone looking to replace a watch band but doesn't want to spend much money."
4.0,I sent it to my niece for her baby girls 1st birthday and the size runs big..  My niece does like it though and her daughter will be able to wear it for a couple of winters as it is that much to big.
4.0,"I really love the color and design, but my legs were far too long. I ordered a Medium, I'm 145 lbs and 5 foot 7. Any time I bend over my butt shows. Besides the fitting issue, I really love it."
4.0,Love this bathing suit! Fits as expected!
4.0,"Fast Delivery, and just as described"
4.0,nice would buy again
4.0,The coat is very stylish but is a lighter weight coat and not suitable for very cold temperatures.
4.0,"Love the belt, but need to get used to the &#34;unique&#34; release lever.  Recommend for casual or dress."
4.0,Stamped letters were bad quality but seller refunded full price for this issue
4.0,Listing shows leather on the inside of the glasses but it's just shiny white plastic with dimples inside looks cheap.
4.0,Not true to size a little small but will do for the smaller bridesmaids that I have.  Still very good for price
4.0,"A little small to fit in the number of cards, but overall happy with this vegan product. Waiting to see if it stretches over time."
4.0,"The color on Amazon is different then the color you get, but still very pretty . Will keep it"
4.0,"Not the same color as I was expecting. The photo was a deeper red burgundy, but this is more on the pink/purple side than red. Definitely won't go with the scarf I had intended to wear it with, but I'll find something else to go with this and rock it for the holidays anyways."
4.0,"Love these and got many complents. However the velcro did not last long which i replaced myself easy enough, but should not have had to."
4.0,I like this loose top style with bright floral color but too bad it was defective at the ruffle hemp. The hemp was mistakenly sewn up to the side arm ruffle.
4.0,"I purchased the tan.  This is a beautiful little purse, with plenty of room inside.  That said, I have an iPhone Xr that only has an Otterbox case on it, and I have to JAM it into the purse, because it's just a smidge too wide.  This case doesn't add more than 1/4 inch to the phone, so to advertise it as fitting the Xr phones is a touch misleading.  It DOES fit, but I would have to tug it out to answer it.  The workmanship on this purse is quite nice."
4.0,I love the pantie.  Its mostly satin and does not stretch a lot so the size that you get is important.  I ordered the dusty rose color and it was more of a brown then the image shows.  Its the only reason i gave it 4 stars.  I was wanting something more pink then brown.  But they fit nice.
4.0,"These YEEPSYS Womens Yoga Running Capris Leggings are quite thick and not see-through at all (probably due to the thickness). When I ordered them, I knew they didn't have pockets but I failed to notice that they have this black swirl design that nearly perfectly outlines your butt cheeks. SO not flattering, IMO! They are also much longer than I expected. For reference, I am 5'7"", 170lbs with a 32"" waist and the size Large fits good. If not for the thickness (these are definitely winter only leggings!) and the solid black outline highlighting my backside, I'd keep these. As it is, I have donated mine to my local women's shelter in hopes that another lady will love them."
4.0,Just started wearing these. I love them. Got some for girlfriends.
4.0,My spouse is 180 lb with 38 waist. Fit comfortably loose.  Soft.
4.0,"Doesn't look cheap, works well. Looks like it might run a teeny bit fast. I had set it and then a month later realized it was 2 minutes ahead of my computer clock. A bit tricky to remember how to set all the features, but the description says it all, so I just keep coming back to the page."
4.0,"Very cute, stylish accessory. My daughter bought it to go with her Halloween costume and it was a cute addition. The clips that hold it on were super strong and held it in place. Some of the little chains and gears fell off during use though."
4.0,Very cute bag! I've had it a day and I keep getting compliments!
4.0,Very pretty - I just wish it came as a breakaway. I had to sew Velcro on the straps to accommodate safety procedures.
4.0,Beautiful dress! It did for me right in the arms and around the bust but it was a manageable fit. It did have some loose strings I had to snip but nothing serious. Loved the dress and worked great for the ball!
4.0,Ok for this price the fabric was way better as expected. I'm 5'2 125lbs. I normally wear a small in Victoria secrets swimsuits. I ordered a medium and it cut in a lot on the sides.
4.0,"This fit my ginormous (and quite awful) throw pillow!  The opening in the cover is generous, about 21-22 inches of the 24, so it wasn't a big fight.  The body is almost a light weight duck cloth.  A reviewer said the stitching on the pattern was incomplete. I completely disagree. I feel that the use of white space on the tree trunk is on purpose to indicate striation, verses a fault in the stitching.  I had only one 1/8th inch loose end in the embroidery of the leafs.  This aqua is crisp and bright!  There is a piping of brown all the way 'round.  The zipper is nicely covered.  This is a  well appointed cover."
4.0,"The first pair I ordered, one of the leverbacks fell open loosely and couldn't be closed after wearing them a few times.....I loved the earrings and had to order a second pair.....Hoping the same thing doesn't happen, because I do love them....."
4.0,They look great. Love them!
4.0,"Really like the fabric but I haven't washed it yet.  I'm 5'10"" and the length was good.  Like the colors of the teal and the purple.  Plan to wear them with kimonos, denim vests or jackets, and crocheted vase."
4.0,"a bit too short. I'm usually a small but i ordered a medium. The material was good, though."
4.0,Fits great and looks very casual. Excited to wear it this summer. Perfect for beach
4.0,"I ordered a large, I am 5’3” and I weigh 165"
4.0,Larger then I expected but still a good purchase.
4.0,Like it very much - comfortable but prone to catching on sharp objects so try not to wear necklaces that catch.  Little balls appear after much use - much like a towel would..
4.0,"Great pajama set, warm, true to size. Only thing missing are pockets, which would have been great. After washing, it does tend to pill a bit. Also a bit pricey."
4.0,For the money I like it. It's not perfectly accurate with the features but it does keep good time and it is a nice looking watch. It's very comfortable on my wrist. The band is very soft and flexible. It just feels good on the wrist. Not a huge watch so that's good too. I like it but temper your expectations in the accuracy department. It's a good value for the price. If you like the Garmin style military watches you will like this at a fraction of the cost.
4.0,"Lovely dress, I'm 172pound and I brought a large its a little big..but its 👌"
4.0,Good looking watch!  Batteries died a few months after purchasing.
4.0,"These are large cases which are good to accommodate larger frames.  The material is durable with nice and soft inside linings. However, there doesn't seem to be much self-support with the cases, so it will be easy for glasses to be crushed if placed in a tight or pressured area. These are more just for scuff than structural protection.<br /><br />The cases close very tight, which is good in terms of glasses not falling out, but it makes it impossible to squeeze open with one hand. You have to use your finger to pry top open.<br /><br />The cases received were not according to the listing; one is black (not blue), and the other is light tan (not really pink).<br /><br />I recommend these for casual or say in-car protection or storage; might not be ideal for packing/travel where pressure might be beyond cases' ability to protect glasses."
4.0,"Soo I definitely like the top, the material is very staticy though. It's quite cute and well made. I normally wear a size medium, sometimes a large if I want it more flowy however based on the sizing guidelines I ordered an XL because I am a 36C bust. It fits perfectly in the chest, any smaller and it wouldn't, but the rest is still kinda lose.... Not sure if I'll keep it but I do like it."
4.0,It's Beautiful Necklace with the Superman Charm. The Chain itself could be a Little Heavyer the Superman Charm could a Little bit heavyer as well. Other than that not bad of a Price.
4.0,Cute piercings the only thing is that the bar is a bit long
4.0,"I wore these for the first time today. I'm giving them 4 stars because my feet were hurting by the end of the day. I have a feeling that will go away, once I break them in. As for the look, they are gorgeous. Like all Frye's, the quality is superb. I know these will last a lifetime and look better with age."
4.0,"Great pin at a great price.  Only wish/complaint is that I wish it had a gizmo on the back, or maybe a second pin, to prevent it from flipping to one side or the other.  It is very much a great item, though.  As a former C-141 Nav, it's a great conversation starter."
4.0,My niece really liked it! So happy!
4.0,Super sharp on one side and the color crusts off. But I love the aesthetic
4.0,"Not a fan of the material. However, I rocked it and received tons of Compliments. I am 5 months expecting and it was very accommodating for my growing belly. I accessorized with a yellow necklace and Fedora hat while on Vacation.  Normally a 14/16 and ordered an XL."
4.0,Larger in size than I expected but nice material.
4.0,Beautiful dress. Fit very well. Material somewhat thinner than expected.
4.0,Too longer than expected to ship but fits great and color is close to picture
4.0,"Good looking, comfortable sandals."
4.0,It is very cute but is very small so order 2 sizes larger
4.0,nice look for an inexpensive item.
4.0,"It wasn't what I was expected. The fabric was thinner, and it was hard to figure out the front of the dress as some other reviews pointed out. Also, I think it might be the fabric but it's too loose around my chest and my stomach.  Besides that, it's a really cute dress and prefect for a casual get together or something a little more classy and dressy."
4.0,"i bought a bunch of different plumeria earrings to wear in my upper ear piercing (cartilage).  these sit up so high they look silly.  so i popped one off the post, trimmed it down with a razor, and haven't yet glued it back on the post, but i know they'll be cute as long as they sit closer to my ear.  hopefully will post a photo soon."
4.0,I really like this wallet and it has plenty of room.  It's just a little bulkier than I prefer.  Very pretty wallet though and arrived on time!
4.0,Great variety of patterns for girls and boys.  My son and his friends loved them!
4.0,"This product came larger than needed, but very comfortable and I will definitely wear regularly."
4.0,"These were too small for my 8 year old with a round head.  The arms had to flex a lot to fit his head, yet they slide down his nose.  Very cute and I like the rubbery frame.  Cannot speck to durability."
4.0,Nice fit. Nice details.
4.0,"Love it!!! It arrived quickly, packaged well. It is a great size and makes all my cards so accessible. The leather is soft. I showed it to one of my friends and she ordered one and also loves it!!"
4.0,Good product but a little thicker then I would have liked because it makes them warmer and harder to breath with them on.
4.0,Prompt delivery. Love the color. Good fit
4.0,I like the thinner weight of these compared to a standard crew sock.  Elastic is a little tight on a couple of them.
4.0,I love this vinyl’s sheen! It’s so beautiful! You HAVE TO follow the package instructions because it will melt if the press is too hot. It took me a few minutes to figure it out but the results were lovely. I’m hoping it’ll hold up to multiple washing because it’s very delicate.
4.0,Absolutely love this skirt. But it's see through so you'll need a slip.
4.0,There was nothing wrong with the shirt other than being small.
4.0,they are alright.
4.0,Very pretty it arrived quickly and well packaged.  I will use it as a headband not a face mask.
4.0,"I need these types of tanks because I have the c-section belly hangover. One of them came ripped in places at the lace. Other than that, I liked them."
4.0,okey
4.0,"Lovely suit and slimming, but runs a little<br />big if you are a ten."
4.0,I liked how this shirt fit. I liked everything about it I will wear it a lot. However I would say it is over priced.But I have paid a lot more for things that are hanging with the tag still on! So I guess this is a great deal!
4.0,Very heavy nice
4.0,Love the bands. However the pink cheatah print one looks faded out of the packaging and they’re all a bit snug. I used to have Samsung and recently switched to apple. Samsung I can wear the s/m band but so far with apple it seems to be a bit smaller in size. If there was an option for the m/l size i would have probably gotten it instead
4.0,"Cute top and decently made.  It's loose and flowy... I usually wear a medium or large and I ordered the large to be on the safe side, but I think a medium would have fit fine."
4.0,Absolutely stunning but too big.
4.0,"I arrived quickly and was as pictured. It's a bit weighty which is fine, and I'm glad I ordered it. The 4 stars are because I thought the eyes of the tiger would be more blue than teal. Other than that, I'm happy with my purchase."
4.0,It was a perfect dress.
4.0,"I am a hoop earring wearing person, have been for years. I buy cheaper ones because I loose them, and they usually turn color. These have not and they are light."
4.0,"Nice hat. Well made, but smaller than expected."
4.0,only complaint so far is its kinda long and its caught on things when I have it resting outside my pocket.
4.0,I am pale so these do not look exactly as the woman pictured because she is very tan. It does make me appear to be more pale than usual but I still really do like them and like the fit. It just gives me an incentive to get out in the sun more.
4.0,great looking socks- light weight but thats fine. fit as a normal sock would. I don't get it that they are marked Polo . and if your a prime member they don't come in 2 days
4.0,"I was hoping it would have been longer is the only thing I would change. It ends right on the hip. I also didn't realize it has pockets, but that's just a fun addition."
4.0,So comfortable great price and true to size
4.0,Get compliments all the time ! Why spend hundreds of dollars when these work just as well.
4.0,This is the perfect item for any SPN fan. It fits amazingly and it was very comfortable around my neck.
4.0,Great Apple watch band for the money.
4.0,This is a nice looking band. The tool kit that shipped with the band makes it easy to remove bands if needed.
4.0,Beautiful shoes and she got compliments on them too. They were a bit still and I think that bothered her but she seemed ok. She wouldn’t wear them again though.
4.0,Size was normal size. I had ordered the dusty pink but it is actual bright salmon. Definitely not the color pictured. Nice short but returned due to not color pictured
4.0,"I almost always wear a size medium in shirts and sweaters (large if they’re European size). I have been working hard to build up my upper body and wanted this shirt so I could show it off a bit. And although I don’t look like the model, I do have some decent arms that look good in the right shirt and size.  Sadly I didn’t pay close enough attention to the size chart and ended up with a standard short sleeve shirt that has a little bit of stretch to it. Without the athletic/muscle fit, this is just a nice short-sleeve shirt. Not spectacular, but not bad.<br />The material is pretty lightweight. It has some nice stretch to it, although it isn’t real stretchy. So if you’re ordering it to show off the guns and the chest, you need to make sure it is on the tight side to begin with."
4.0,Good product but a little too small for my needs. This is NOT the seller's fault but my own.
4.0,Roy is well made and durable yet safe for kids. My 3 yr old has a blast with it!
4.0,Soft material  and cute style. Flowy and light weight. The way the shirt drapes in the back is a little..different but I'll probably keep the shirt. It'll probably grow on me.
4.0,It’s definitely comfortable.  My only problem is when the treads come loose and they tickle my nose.
4.0,I only gave this a 4 bc there are only 2 card pockets and no other places to store anything like cash that other holders have.
4.0,Their beautiful and good quality but two of the glass balls came broken.
4.0,"My family just absolutely adore these Galiva socks! -----They have a nice packaging too. They fit perfectly and are great for keeping feet warm, even though they are cotton. Since trying Galiva brand socks we are now fans of the brand and will get more, however, the heels do have a tendency to wear out quickly sometimes."
4.0,"A little see through. I purchased a medium and when the material is pulled up to where it is supposed to be, the design looks faded.  Very soft and comfortable workout pants.  Stay in place.  Comfortable on stomach as well. I have worn twice and they just look more worn out because of the way the material stretches"
4.0,Perfect for the occasion of roaring twenties
4.0,"The style is fine, but the material is not. It’s polyester with spandex, and I just feel like it’s cheap and weird. Not for me."
4.0,"Flattering cut and nice soft flowing fabric that is light, but not sheer. If you have a little extra here and there it will show, though. It's not a magic tunic. ;)"
4.0,"It's a cute shirt and it fits similar to the model but it's a bit tight in the shoulder/chest area. I am usually between a medium and large (36b) and ordered the large. I'm keeping it because my husband really liked the look and the material is comfy but disappointed in the fit considering how well their sister brand, Ovadia, fits my husband."
4.0,"I'm 5'5&#34; and about 190 lbs. This dress came to my knees in the front and is just a little higher in the back. The sleeves weren't tight. It fit just right across the chest, and is just a little more clingy than I like across the belly, but not too much. I can wear a lightweight flowy cardigan over it if I feel self-conscious about the belly. I bought it to wear with leggings, and it worked great for that. I also bought it as a less expensive alternative to the LulaRoe brand dresses. I have now ordered it in navy and gray."
4.0,"This was a great buy, however my sister couldn't bare the material at the top of the dress. She said it was too itchy. Thats the only reason i returned it. The dress is lenght appropriate and beautiful fit."
4.0,Genuine Denim Shoulder Bag Purse<br /><br />I like this purse.  It is my everyday purse.  It it is the right size.  I like the length of the straps.  The only complaint I have is that there should be divided compartments in it.  Overall it is a good bag for the price.
4.0,"I like it and it did warm me however, this product sheds a lot.  Perhaps it should be placed in the dryer on air to remove excess fur.  While at my gala I had black hears on the table and my coffee up.  That was the only sad part thankfully I were black."
4.0,It looks black and grey but it came in a light grey with an army green .. I still wear it and it fits great very comfortable.
4.0,"Good quality, worth the money!<br />I’m a 14-16 normally and went with an XXL expecting this to run small. It works but would have been better with an XL<br />Still, very pleased"
4.0,"I ordered a large tall and I hoped the sleeves would be a bit longer, but other than that the fit is good for my husband who is 6'4&#34; and has a thin build"
4.0,"These nightgowns have a simple, cute design, and the fabric is super soft. The color is less pink and more neutral-pink, so it's not true to color. That's the only reason I'm giving it 4 stars rather than 5."
4.0,It fits nicely- plenty roomy appears to be good quality .
4.0,Uniboob not attractive
4.0,Nice watch band I would buy it again if it broke
4.0,"Beautiful set. Was smaller than I expected.( which is totally ok) But looks exactly as pictured. Shipping was speedy. Only missing a back to one of the earings.  Other than that, everything was there."
4.0,"It's a cute, soft comfortable jacket. I had expectedo a floral  but it was rather abstract. I kept it tbecause it was so comfortable."
4.0,After trying on it seems to work and looks like it’s I’ll be fun to wear in the dark. Material is very thin though. Looks like it won’t last for years ahead
4.0,Great quality. Heavy. Fit is large so go with size smaller than you are used to.
4.0,Very nice fabric and doesnt looks cheap. The skirt runs big but nothing a little altering cant fix.
4.0,The padding is not properly secured it to lose.
4.0,Mother enjoyed it as it was a mother's day present. She just has difficulty with the clasp. Only drawback. Beautiful jewelry and true size.
4.0,"Just what I needed.  Construction and colors are great.  So far, they are ok. We'll see how long the buckle lasts."
4.0,"Very cute, but packaged terribly. The chain was almost impossibly mangled. It took an hour to untangle, and I'm just thankful it didn't break."
4.0,"these are great to wear with a nice pair of shorts, a nice casual skirt or your favorite pair of jans"
4.0,had to exchange size ran slightly larger
4.0,"Overall product quality is very nice, very breathable and wicks moisture greatly.<br /><br />The only issue is sizing, I'm 5'10"" - 240 (muscular/fat if that makes any sense) and went with a XXL worried about sizing. This ended up not being so compressive to me at that size.<br /><br />Going with an XL for good compression or even L for max compression would have been optimal.<br /><br />The silver lining is that this is a great and ratjer comfy compression undershirt at the bought size."
4.0,My biggest problem with this bra is putting it on and taking it off. Maybe I need instructions.
4.0,Nice but had to return.  Toe box is very narrow.  Looks chic and wished they had fit better.  Great if you have an arch and narrow feet.  Very soft and supple and size was accurate only narrow.
4.0,"Bought this swimsuit and a matching one for my daughter, her 1st birthday party is going to be little mermaid and the swimsuit is perfect for the even. swimsuit fits true to its size, cannot wait to see my daughters !!"
4.0,"Very light weight, comfortable and stylish"
4.0,The tent itself is very good easy to put up. However the carrying bag is not great no padding on the carry straps makes it very uncomfortable to carry for any distance.
4.0,"New out of the box review.<br /><br />Looks fantastic on my blue dial Wenger Terragraph.  It's heavier than the stock bracelet.  And it gives the watch a bulkier look.  Clasp feels secure.  Adjustment was easy with screws holding the links in place.  The only reason this isn't a 5 star review is because this bracelet is big.  I could use one more removable link.  I'm not a little guy, and I've used up all the adjustment and the watch is just a touch looser on my wrist than I prefer.  If my diet takes hold I may have to put this bracelet aside as I don't like my watches any more loose fitting."
4.0,I really like the bag. I wish it was a little bigger; however it great for both school and work.
4.0,"Fits well, easy to adjust, very comfortable. The only problem I had were the rubber o rings, there is barely any size difference between the two they send you and even the slightly larger one runs into problems fitting it onto a toy. I'd suggest getting extra rings if you get this."
4.0,"Fabric is scratchy, doesn't look cheap though. Will be perfect for this summer.<br /><br />Bought at a discount*"
4.0,"If you wear it for a longer duration of time your ears will start to hurt, even swell...strong magnet, look very real like pierced, I bought 8 as a size and it was a little big."
4.0,I just wish it had two loops on the put the building other than that is perfect love it.
4.0,I love the size of this purse and the compartments inside the purse.
4.0,Sent the wrong color.  Very disappointed 😞 by that. Shipping was long. But love the product wish it was longer
4.0,"This purse is very pretty and just the right size.  It is a fabric with a golden sparkle to it.  I would have given it 5 stars, but it is difficult to open ( as others noted also).  I can get it open but I have to find the right spot to push.  I am probably going to keep it for the wedding.  It is the right color and size, and comes with 2 chains (long and short)."
4.0,"Thick enough fabric, not see through. Comfortable, has pockets, would need a pin or a cami in a work situation for the front"
4.0,Bought for Christmas Stocking stuffers for 5 different teens to young adults. Everyone was pleased they were able to choose 20 favorites.  Giving everyone many chances to change their display based on mood.
4.0,With only 3 bags I had to constantly push down the over the door clip to close the door.  I guess it depends on the weight of your bags.  But it was just a bit annoying to each time have to hold down the silver part (at top) to close the door. But otherwise it was what I was looking for to have all my bags tucked away in one place
4.0,"We filled one bottle, and so far no leaks.  I clipped it to my son's belt loop so he was able to have it on him to clean his hands as needed.<br /><br />Edited to add that within 2-3 times of my son using a bottle, the lid breaks and no long stays closed.  I  only ding'ed the review one star because standing up to a little boy is a tall tasks, and they're pretty inexpensive.  Seems to last longer for me before they break."
4.0,"Great quality, cute pattern and my daughter can't live without it. She's 4.5 with a rather large head. My only complaint is that it's pretty tight going over her head, but it still works."
4.0,Comfy and fit as expected. 5'4 180 lbs got an XL and fits great. Drapes to the floor so it would work for someone a bit taller as well. Seems to be a nice fabric as well. I do wish they had loops for the belt though!
4.0,Boyfriends mother loved this as a birthday present from him
4.0,"Love the earrings, a little smaller than I hoped, good design, I have already had complements on them packed well"
4.0,The bag came in a very small box so I was worried but once unfolded it is a decent size. the material is a little odd as it feels a lot like a high end rain coat instead of the leather-like material it looks like.  The zippers are plastic and take a little effort to zip and unzip. The bag looks as if it could stand on its own. It does not have the support throughout the bag to do so. It's not what I expected from the picture but still a cute and useful bag.
4.0,"The hat is cute.  It has a drawstring on the inside so you can adjust how tightly it fits, which could help in windy situations too.  The hat is good quality."
4.0,"Very cute--a little on the small side, but still wearable."
4.0,Good tank for the price
4.0,"but feels a bit weak.  The fabric feels not nearly as stiff as a quality name brand hat.  With that being said, it still holds up well, the stitching is still in place and the brim is still solid."
4.0,"Loved this only didn’t like that the bottoms were sheer. The top was padded and double lined, wish they would’ve lined the bottoms. Strings on top are very long, or it could be because I have a short torso"
4.0,I haven't used them for walking/running yet but they fit very nicely.
4.0,These are ingenious solution for towing reading glasses conveniently. I own sever types but chose these as they looked great for every day and appeared sturdy. I do like them very much but have two issues:<br />1- the black leather piece leaves the black dye on your hands (when you adjust it) and neck<br />2- it took me a bit to figure out how to adjust these. Directions would have helped.
4.0,It's soft and keeps you warm. Reminds me of an Ewok from Star Wars.
4.0,I like the color and the fabric.
4.0,I LOVE this dress! It makes me feel pretty and stylish!<br />What someone else may not like about this dress...it’s very low cut. I added a stitch (a safety pin would work too) to hide some of it. The slit in the front is high. I wear spandx shirts underneath so I didn’t flash everyone. I will most likely add a stitch or two along the seam to prevent this.<br />I am 5’2” and a 36D. I ordered the 12/14. I probably could have ordered a size down.<br />I plan to order it in a second pattern. I’m going to wear these all summer.
4.0,Good quality socks soft durable smooth but a little too tight in the ankle.
4.0,"Very good, I wish it was non iron."
4.0,"Great shoe for a cheap import. Deep Navy color, durable soles, very comfy. Have worn many times over a year and have aged well. Great purchase."
4.0,Great for the price. I bought them for my sister's wedding that had mint green as her color. The only downside is that one of the pink &#34;stones&#34; had slight discoloration as if someone had spilt pink paint on top of it but it was not noticeable from a distance. I got tons of compliments!
4.0,My daughter is a size 9 has been in 8s but they are too small-so bought a 10 they are too big-
4.0,"I like the shirt so much, feel really good."
4.0,Small but workable. The price is right. I just straightened out the stems where they would not loop over the ear. They are snug without overlapping my ears. I like the old time look.
4.0,like the look of this garment.  very flattring
4.0,Like this pin. Just wished the flame colors on the fire were reversed. (Red on bottom orange on top)
4.0,"if rosary necklace no heavy enough, it rolls within just while you run or walk. can't get macked out with rollin your necklace in."
4.0,"I am wishing they had a 2xl. It fits a little small for an xl but it works. Took a while to get so I am not sending it back. Fabric was okay and not see through so that was a plus, and I LOVE the pockets! I am 5'6&#34; so the length was okay."
4.0,"I originally ordered a large in the wine color and it was somewhat smaller than I anticipated. I looked like a sausage in it. So instead, I ordered an XL in the royal blue - my favorite color, thinking it will be the right fit. It is a little too big. The dress is drapey instead of clingy. I look like a little girl playing dress up in mommy's clothes.<br /><br />I normally wear a medium - I am 161 lbs, 34DD, 5'2&#34;. Bought the large originally based on other reviews. Bought the next size up based on the fitting of original order."
4.0,"Bought this to surprise my fiance this Valentine's Day.  Looks like the picture, shiny rubber look. Fits me different than the girl in the picture, but I think she has more boom in the back than me lol Still very sexy and comfortable."
4.0,Smaller than what I thought but it still was nice. I got it for a present for someone
4.0,They are decent but after wearing for multiple hours tend to slide down.
4.0,"Just right. Shelves are a little big but can be adjusted with very little work. Great fabric, soft and light. Perfect for Halloween or a special night"
4.0,"Love the compact size of my new clutch! Holds my phone, keys and credit cards safely.<br />Thanks for the referral!<br />angela - TX"
4.0,"Cutest, most comfortable tube top I've ever owned! I want one in every color!"
4.0,Pretty sick.
4.0,My granddaughter is excited to wear these sandals.  She loves the cherry and says the foot bed is comfortable. The shoes appear to be well made. I do wish the velcro strap allowed for more adjustment. She needs like a little tighter and the placement of the bottom velcro gets in the way of the metal buckle to tighten it more. Otherwise these sandals are very nice.
4.0,"This dress feels good and looks good. But unfortunately it didn’t fit me. It was a little too bIg,<br />I ordered a small, bust 34, waist 25, hips 34, 4”11 105 lbs. if the seller has an extra small I would gladly get it but as for this small one I may have to return it."
4.0,Love the size and open mesh. Good value for price.Needed to resew and glue one of the seams.
4.0,"These pajamas are so soft and stretchy. I could live in them! I actually pulled them right out out of the package and put them on. They’re that lovely! I do hope they keep selling this style and I think it’s great that so many colors are offered. It always cracks me up when you shop plus size clothes online and it says “True to size. Order normal size.” Yeah right! I’m 5’5” and I weigh 255. My chest measures 55”, waist 47”, hips 54”. According to the size chart I wear a 5X. My absolutely ONLY issue with these fabulous jammies is that I wish I had ordered a 4X. Fortunately, the drawstring on the shorts is fully adjustable so I can pull it tight enough to keep the shorts up. I’ll probably shorten the drawstring because it hangs down pretty far after I tie them off. I’m waiting on that to see if they shrink up any after they go through the wash though I doubt they will. My normal “true to size” is a 2X or 3X because I wear a 42H bra. In these I think my “true to size” would be a 4X. Even the top is big and baggy which I like but I feel confident a 4X would have worked just as well. At this point you couldn’t pry these comfortable jammies out of my cold dead hands though so I guess the 4X will have to wait for my next order. Lol!"
4.0,It was exactly what it showed. Love it. Pretty and will be around for a long time.
4.0,Love the wallet. Only problem I have is that my Credit cardd tend to stick in the slots and are hard to remove at times. Otherwise great product for the price. Paid full price!!!
4.0,"I mostly love this coat.<br />First what I like about it: It is comfortable, it is warm and it is long.<br />What is not so great:  It came smushed in a bag and is way wrinkled.  I was able to iron out most of the wrinkles.  I tested the fabric with an iron on the inside, and found I was able to steam iron at a lower steam setting most of the wrinkles out. The fake fur around the hood looked like a long- haired cat caught in the rain.  I was able to make it look much better, by brushing it with a hair brush.  If you don't like the fake fur, you can detach it as it is attached with a zipper.<br /><br />I ordered a size smaller than I would have, as a lot of people said it ran small.  They were right, and the smaller size fits perfectly.<br /><br />Because of the wrinkles and bad fake fur, it got 4 stars instead of 5 stars."
4.0,"This is a great little backpack which I couldn't use as my commuter bag, as initially planned, but will be great for trips.  The anti-theft feature is great, though inconvenient.  It's a little difficult to get into since the zippered entrance is on the backside,, but I guess that's the point!  It's nice looking, sturdy and hangs well off the shoulder.  I am pleased with it."
4.0,"I like the different color options that I can match the bracelet with my outfit. However, I wish the text included ""Medical Alert"" or something additional to fill the entire band and not have the possibility of being missed."
4.0,Fit and design is very good. Feel is comfortable.
4.0,Fit well! Very comfortable
4.0,Feels good and looks good. It fit as expected and is very comfortable.
4.0,I like the neck not being too large. Shirt fits a little snug.
4.0,Love it but is not ultra light. Perfect for my daughter Ji jitsu class. Affordable price and good quality.
4.0,The belt is to big. Most are to big for me.
4.0,Cute and shiny - but a tad bit bigger than I expected.  Overall good for the price.
4.0,"Love them!!! SUPER ADORABLE, SPARKLY AND FUN!! LIGHTWEIGHT TOO<br /><br />SIDE NOTE: smaller than expected, I'm used to super big and chunky earrings and these were not as big as they lead you to believe."
4.0,More for a slim person with a flat stomach
4.0,This is a pretty bag and it's also big. The only bad thing is the bag material can be made better.
4.0,"These velvety leggings fit great and offer good support.  They are substantial enough to wear on their own, but lightweight enought to wear under layers if you like.  Be careful pulling them on, as the stitching around the waistband broke in one area on mine.  I will fix it myself, since it is a small problem."
4.0,"My first impression as I opened the package was that this thing is huge and heavy. As I peeled layer after layer of careful packaging and annoying plastic films from various nooks and corners of this bag, it emerged as quite an elegant, intelligently designed and stylish looking hand bag.<br />It is kind of on the heavy side. 100% pure leather.<br />So if you are frail and delicate, this might not be the best choice to lug around as you will get tired.<br />If you are traveling or have a job that requires you to carry around documents, laptop, ipad, n stuff, you have found the perfect bag. Mind you, with the contents it would become even heavier. Please consider that before you buy.<br />Another cool feature is that it is form retaining and there is this thoughtfully placed widening cord placed on the two inner ends so....when you tie one end to the other the bag stays wide open for you to sift through if you were looking for something. Isn't that smart?!!<br />I will keep it:-)"
4.0,"I just got it yesterday,and it seems to work on &#34;lowering my shoulders&#34;."
4.0,I holds a lot of things. Only one thing I would change is the handle could be shorter.
4.0,I received it much earlier than expected. Very comfortable. not quite as flowy as the picture unless you go up a size.
4.0,"I liked these sandals, the only thing I would say to you guys is to be careful with the back part of the sandal. It is a bit rough and might cause blisters. If you plan on walking more than a couple of feet at a time, do not wear."
4.0,I have enjoyed this cardi.  It does run small but I ordered accordingly based on other reviews.  It washes beautifully and I am quite happy with the quality.
4.0,"THIS BRACELET IS A GIFT FOR A PERSON WHO HAS MANY EGYPTIAN THEMED TATTOOS AND I THINK HE WILL LIKE THE LOOK OF IT. IT'S A BIT SMALLER THAN IT APPEARS ONLINE,BUT I KNEW THE MEASUREMENTS WHEN I BOUGHT IT,SO NO SURPRISE THERE. IT SEEMS WELL MADE AND ARRIVED IN EXCELLENT SHAPE."
4.0,"Bought these in the Spring before the softball season.  They were great on and off the field.  However, they ended up breaking in half at the nose.  For the price they were great"
4.0,I haven't worn it yet it's a little warm outside the blouse fits very comfortable I like the 3/4 sleeves it's very slender rising and looks great on
4.0,"Fits a bit tight on my average sized head, but better quality than i had hoped for."
4.0,"Cute, son love it"
4.0,"Don't know why I thought this was going to be grey. It's not. It's black with a shiny, pewter (with light blue outline), iron-on type decal, surely gonna be get that plastic crinkle it in. The hat and logo look nice. When I received it, in a small envelope, the decal had been folded to ship and now has a crease across the logo. I can fold the bottom of the cap up a few times, but then have fold it down to uncover the logo. Since it's one-size, the emblem will sit differently on different people's skulls. It's a nice thin skull cap that will likely fit under a baseball cap and comfortably under a knit cap. It's good by itself too. I'm disappointed, but still like the hat."
4.0,nice cover over
4.0,I love Telic but they seem a little inconsistent. These were on the smaller side of 8. The other 2 I ordered previously fit perfect. I would return these but they are not offering very many of these Telic sandals thru Amazon at this price.  Hope they will stretch a bit more.
4.0,"I’ve recently started wearing a medium in my workout pants but I’m glad I got a large in these. They are very form fitting, exactly like the description states. They are like a second skin. But, the description was wrong about how they fit for short people. I’m 5’0” tall and had a lot of material bunched at the ankles. I tried to capture it in my pictures. It made it look like I was wearing leg warmers over black leggings. But, that’s not necessarily a problem.<br /><br />I worked out in them and they moved great. There are pockets in each side, generous pockets that held my iPhone with no issue. That is a huge issue for me with workout pants typically. And I wore these outside on a 30 degree day, my legs were a little chilly so not overly protective but, who needs that in a gym! I wouldn’t recommend buying a size smaller to take care of the length, if you need the size you’re buying. I don’t think I could have fit in a smaller size. Other than length, these were perfect!"
4.0,I use this for my self defense class and I love it.
4.0,Overall cute and light weight. The black pair appeared to have extra rings at different points. Luckily it was an easy fix to remove them. None of the other pairs came this way.
4.0,Purchased for my daughter who loves my Pandora bracelet and wanted a look a like. The item was an amazing price and surprisingly good quality. Item arrived super fast and my daughter loves it.
4.0,"I thought the underskirt would be a bit longer, it hits slightly below the knee while the layers of tulle reach to the floor or close to it.<br /><br />Out of the package, this dress smells disgusting. After a few hours the smell went away, but wow was it gross.<br /><br />My daughter put it on and played in it for a few hours. She loved it and felt very princess-y. It looks beautiful on her."
4.0,"it fits large in the hip area if you don't have hips, but it's an easy fix.. if you're curvy no problem:) Very cute dress"
4.0,They fit just fine and were about 1/2 the price of getting them from Maui Jims. These lens are not as thick as the original lens. I don't know if that will affect it's usable lifetime or not.
4.0,wish it can with two one for each ear
4.0,"It's a lil big, but if u have small Wrist like me.one link out  on each side will fit perfect."
4.0,I bought this chain to hold my daddy's ring on. It is the perfect size for that
4.0,Te earrings are nice. They were just a little smaller than I anticipated but matched perfectly with a necklace that I have!
4.0,"The fabric is pretty! and not sheer. But I'll return it because it's a bit too loose and too long for my taste. I'm 5'3 on a good day (ended right below my knees) and too loose even in a size small  (I'm petite, 34C-32D, 130ish lbs and 20 weeks pregnant). If you're taller and weigh a bit more, this may be the dress for you!"
4.0,I like this bag for the gym and for every day life. It's functional and keeps clean easily.
4.0,I got this to wear outside during the summer. It works but it also gets very hot. But still a good option if you want or need this kind of coverage.
4.0,"I bought this at Party City for $39.99.  Compared to what is out there as far as chainsaw props, this is the best out of the easily accessible ones.  The version out now looks a bit different than what is pictured above, the knob on the side is spherical.  Also, the sound has changed - it is not as good now.  It repeats the same 3 second sound over and over and ends up not sounding like a chainsaw.  The blood splatter is very evenly spaced on the blade.  I will probably mod this - repaint it and make it look better.  I am toying with the idea of opening it up and seeing how the sound works - I may add my own sound if possible."
4.0,"Doesn't look like the picture, but it's a soft shirt and has fun sleeves."
4.0,Wish it was a little heavier material.  Fit is good.  Looks good.
4.0,"Loved it.  Looks just like the pictures and fit my girl perfectly.  She was asked to be flower girl, and we didn't have time to shop and we haven't been going out due to covid.  I was nervous about ordering a dress online, but it arrived on time and looked great.  I'm so happy with they way it  looked on her, and she loved it too."
4.0,Love the color and style. I just wish that the middle was sewn closed a bit more.
4.0,"Bought it for my 12 yo son, he can carry what he needs without having to use a backpack, 3 compartments for everything a guy might need, iPad, iPhone, water, wallet, keys ect."
4.0,"You only get one shirt in each order so the are a little pricey, but they are very well made with a thick material. Overall they are a great product and worth the price."
4.0,"Product is fine, it was just very hard for my child to get on and so he never wears them. Seems like the quality is all right though."
4.0,"These look very cute on, and the lenses are great--they really are polarized, and they're just dark enough.  However, I have a fairly average sized head, and these are a little too big.  I've tried tightening the arms, but no luck so far."
4.0,I liked all of it.
4.0,I return the Steve Madden shoes I have narrow feet they were a little too wide for my feet but they are very cute sandals if you have wide feet
4.0,It was a birthday gift to my daughter out of state she loves them
4.0,Good quality & fast shipping but they run small. Order the next size up.
4.0,Was a really cute outfit. Onsie was somewhat large. Pants were huge! With a few roll ups it worked just fine and was oh so cute!!
4.0,"I thought writing a review for a luggage tag might be kind of boring, well to tell you the truth it is. And I thought reading a review on a luggage tag might be boring as well, it probably is. But I'm going to write about this tag because it's really unique.  it may be the last luggage tag you will ever buy, unless of course somebody steals your bags. This tag is made of silicone and has a heavy metal grommet at the end.  it secures your luggage with a pretty durable metal cable. Nobody is just going to rip this one off with their bare hands. No clumsy luggage handler will separate it either.  At first I thought $15 for a luggage tag is a little pricey as I usually paid about five or six bucks at the mega store for one of those plastic or fake leather ones.  But you know I Buying and buying and buying them because they kept wearing out or tearing off. So maybe $15 is a little pricey but if this thing lasts as long as I think it will it'll pay for itself.  I'm about to leave on a trip tomorrow morning, so I will be sure to pick out  the meanest, ugliest, ornery, baggage handlers I can find, and I will insult them  to no end,  so we can be sure to get a heavy-duty test of this luggage tag.  Well I won't really, but I will see how well it stands up and report back to you.  Right now I'll give it a four-star recommended buy.<br /><br />If you found my review helpful please click yes on the button below I really appreciate your support for that I intend to leave reviews to help others make decisions prior to purchase taste upon my recommendations or disclosure and I utilize your reviews to help me with my purchases as well I have received this product during the promotional period at a discounted price for my honest review thanks for reading even though I received this product at little or no cost review is not based upon that consideration my reviews honest factual and accurate thank you"
4.0,warm and fits well
4.0,Great necklace just like the photo
4.0,"Really like the look of this bracelet, especially when stacked with the other bracelets I bought with it.  Only gave it 4 stars as it is a bit difficult to take off."
4.0,I was needing more shorts for the warmer weather and am glad I came across these. These shorts are higher-rise shorts but can be rolled down a little if you don't like the higher rise like me with my stomach in the way.  These are comfortable to wear while working out or walking around. The fabric stretches pretty well.
4.0,"I was able to perfectly match my frames to these clip on lenses due to great description with measurements. The clip on device is very sturdy and nice looking. The lenses are lightweight plastic and i am worried they could even tear, but they are VERY effective at blocking the sunlight."
4.0,Small but cute.  If your looking for a stud type earring this will work great.
4.0,just as intended
4.0,larger than anticipated but still fantastic
4.0,It is almost exactly as I thought it would be. I very much like these sunglasses.
4.0,Only had the helmet for 2 days. But so far is very nice  good quality fits good  great item for the price  light and easy to use .
4.0,"I like this even more than I thought I would!<br /><br />It's a really stretchy fabric and flattering.<br /><br />The shoulders are way more puffed than the photo leads you to believe, which might be overkill with the bow.<br /><br />But overall good fit for a curvy gal, and quite charming"
4.0,I have always liked the aviator style glasses so I was excited to receive these!  I have the red mirrored lenses which I was a little skeptical about but it's really a great look.  I also wasn't sure about the gold frame (I usually go for silver) but the red and the gold really compliment each other.  I haven't had any problems with these lenses.  They arrived undamaged and have withstood all of the abuse that my poor glasses seem to endure without so much as being bent!  I received this for free in return for my honest review.
4.0,The seem to one of the small pockets is riped off the stich. I'm going to try and get it resewed back on. Otherwise I like them. Maybe it was just the 1 pair.
4.0,A nice watch - the band a little stiff but okay.
4.0,"The necklace looks like I expected it to, but the quality could be better. It snags a lot and the pieces tend to come off pretty easily. I would advise only wearing this with clothes that won't snag the necklace and letting it hang freely because it won't stay under very many shirts/outerwear because it's too lightweight. Very pretty though."
4.0,"Love the mirror reflection as well of the different styles.  My son does like these sunglasses and I would give 5 stars, but wish they made these a better quality. - Minus 1 star"
4.0,"It's great! I got what I wanted! Perfect colors, a little large, but still great!"
4.0,Beautiful and super economic
4.0,Very nice dress<br />Must go up one size
4.0,"Delivery was great! I didn't expect the jeans to fit my son so snug, but I guess they are ok until washed but I wouldn't dare dry them"
4.0,Great tunic sweat shirt looks great with my jean legging's.
4.0,"This is a very nice dress for the price. Very pretty, just didn't look right on me. I'm 5'5&#34; and length would have been okay with a 2-3&#34; heel."
4.0,"Good quality fabric but I thought it was a loose fit per the pic. She must be wearing a size large because I wear an XS and bought a S and it’s very firm fitting. Not like the pic at all. Once I washed/dried it, it is super short and hugs the body. I wanted something looser - like the picture indicates."
4.0,Love this fur scarf it kept me warm and is nice tucked around your you neck. It is shorter than I expected though but the fur is so soft and cozy. I intend to buy another to join the two together when the black is back in stock.
4.0,Great material and design but fits bigger
4.0,"I like it, it's a soft fairly heavy rayon. I just wish the fabric had more texture (like linen) because the sleeves will not stay if you roll them up."
4.0,The fit is very nice but after a few washes it seems like the color is fading so that's a concern.
4.0,"I love this anklet! It was extremely tough for me to get it on, I had to get my fiance to help me. The two chains do get twisted up throughout the day, that is one downside"
4.0,Very cute but runs small so order 1/2 size larger.
4.0,"Awesome shirt, great quality & washes well. I just wish I ordered 1 size down because it runs a little big."
4.0,I like the quality for the price. it does run a little small.was going to return but no larger size is avail. Im keeping it even though I will need to wear a shaper..
4.0,Good piece of jewelry for the price. Looks exactly like pictures. Not thick but good quality.
4.0,Lightweight but Nice for occasion. Will Tarnish after a while
4.0,The colors were bright and vibrant. Arrived sooner than expected
4.0,Arrived fast and cute
4.0,"It is a tad small and my butt cheeks come out of it a bit, but the skirt part covers my pretty well. It is SUPER CUTE, and I feel good in it."
4.0,"this is very bright!  I get a lot of compliments.  had to glue the corner on one of the triangles, but no big deal.  I also got a free gift inside....it's a rubbery thing that looks like a very large guitar pick...only it's real rubbery.  It said it was a free gift, but I have ZERO clue what it is or what it is used for.  If anyone has any info on that, I'd appreciate it."
4.0,"Just received, and it really is a gorgeous bag. I think it's worth mentioning that the zipper on the front isn't real. It doesn't unzip and open. I was surprised no one mentioned that in the other reviews. Overall I'm happy with it though. It's beautiful."
4.0,"Very comfortable pair of sandals, nice workmanship as well and a great price.."
4.0,"This is a cute watch! It seems to be keeping time, I have had it over a month. I took off a star because I had to put a battery in it, as it was not running when I receive it. But I did by it on clearance."
4.0,"I can not wear cheap earrings as they turn my ears green but after losing several other real gold ones I figured I would give these a try because of the long backs and notch to keep the back from falling off. I was happy with the price and if I lost one it was no big deal. I have three sets of holes and hate taking my earrings out everyday as I have arthritis in my hands which at times makes it difficult to do. They arrived on time and packaged nicely, I  had them in for three weeks now and have had no problems, no itching, no green ears and all are still there, have not lost any. The only reason why I didn't give 5 stars is that the smallest earring in very tiny, but it still looks nice. I would buy again."
4.0,quality and large enough for a good fit.
4.0,"I'm 5'9&#34; and am not stick-thin (about a size 8), so it's a bit short/tight(er than i wanted it to be haha). But the description gave that away before I even bought the item-- i decided to try it out anyway because the price was great, and otherwise was not disappointed. If you're shorter/smaller than me, GO FOR IT. Seriously, there's nothing to lose hahaha"
4.0,"you still squint if theres a lot of sun, not full sun protection with these but they are cute."
4.0,Love the quality but the fit is a bit tighter than I like.
4.0,"Ordered normal size 2x, should’ve ordered 3x. Good quality/colors."
4.0,I loved the shirt ran a little small
4.0,"This is a good medal for the price. The cheap chain it came on gave me a painful rash on my neck that went away within a couple of hours of my removing it. I washed it before wearing but it must just be the metal that I am sensitive to. The round pendant itself did not seem to cause any problems, just the chain. In person, the medal looks more silvery and does not appear gold as in the picture. I prefer the look of silver toned jewelry so that worked out. Details on the piece are pretty good, which I appreciated. Would buy again. Thanks."
4.0,very nice! It's very comfortable and fits just right!
4.0,Everyone Loves it! Only drawback is that It has a gold tone in the pic but it's really silver.  Good piece
4.0,I bought these to layer under scrubs at work. The length is long... which I wanted and I also wanted them looser. I like the material. Only thing is that the arm holes are a little too large. I’d suggest sizing down just a smidge.
4.0,I liked the product just fine it moves well for when I go to therapy. The mesh was a bit warmer than I expected.
4.0,"It looks cool and is nice, but the mechanism that connects the band together, isn't that great and has failed a time or two."
4.0,Daughter's new favorite shorts
4.0,I received them the in 2 days. In time for 4th of July. I love them!! They are a bit small but not noticeable.
4.0,really good and cool in skin
4.0,"Great accessory for my Halloween costume ('80 rockstar). I wouldn't use them in the daylight though, the lenses will probably make you blind."
4.0,"Ok, so when I purchased this I discovered the best way to put it on is feet first and slide it up. I tried over the head and couldn't get it over my chest so was thinking it was the wrong size. But on a whim I went feet first and it fit perfectly after that. I used it as the base of a Dorothy costume. It's cute. I don't think I'd ever wear it as a stand alone piece as it's very see-through."
4.0,"A bit thin on the needle part , but it doesn’t slip so that’s not a big issue. Shines enough when kept clean. Especially if you go out at nightclubs and light hits it (:"
4.0,"A+, Quickly shipped and product looks great - Used on a necklace."
4.0,Perfect.. just as described. Good quality.
4.0,Shirt was alittle too big
4.0,It was a present for a 12 year old girl
4.0,It tends to snag my clothes.
4.0,"Fits good but glad I got a size bigger. I'm 4 weeks post partum. Normally a medium but got a large, covers up post baby bump nicely. Also it is great for nursing!"
4.0,these are cut small but my son would never let me return them.
4.0,A little big but very cute. Also came in the little box
4.0,it's black and it's underwear.  My husband is happy.
4.0,"I like this dress, super flattering but it’s crazy long. I’m 5’4 and have to wear heels or wedges with this dress, there’s no way to wear flats bc it would be dragging on the ground.<br /><br />If you only wear heels/wedges, than it’s a great dress. If you’re petite or don’t like not having the option to wear flats, than skip this dress."
4.0,"This hat is extremely durable, and made in the USA! The brim is stiff and able to be easily posed. My only complaint is that the sizing chart is not accurate. I measured my head and ordered a size small. Hats are usually way too big on me so this seemed accurate. The small was WAY too small on me. I exchanged for a medium which is also snug. I don't usually wear this style of hat so maybe it is supposed to fit fairly snug but I'm not certain. The material is very stiff and durable so there is little to no give. I probably would be happiest with a large but do not feel like exchanging it again.<br /><br />Definitely buy this hat if you're interested, but go AT LEAST one size larger (if not 2).<br /><br />Seller - Please fix sizing chart! It will save everyone money on shipping for exchanges :)"
4.0,"I am not sure if these will shrink, if they do they are amazing. I'll be buying these in other colors"
4.0,Description of product was accurate and worked well for kids Garmin Vivofit 2s.
4.0,The color was accurate to the picture and the lace is very pretty. I sized up and it fit nicely. The sleeves as quite long so I'm likely going to hem them but as a shorter person that isn't too surprising.
4.0,This bag is great. It is very large and holds a ton of stuff. It is very durable.
4.0,"Fabric is flimsy, but it's cute and has a lot of room for cell phone (i have a LG G3) and I put my car keys in it also."
4.0,"Light and flowy, but with some structure. Polished alternative to a cardigan for the office."
4.0,"They are described as having a lot of support for busty women. Let's  just start off by saying I am a 36DD I kept these bras vs. Returning.  You will still have some  movement if running, jogging, jumping, etc. It was uncomfortable at first, because I didn't  expect so much movement since these were described as having a lot of support.<br />They fit well and are a good bargain (4 for under $20). They are a decent support, but not the best. They also come with  bra inserts which is weird, but seem to somewhat make the bra fit or feel better when they are worn. I took one pair  out and it didnt make too much of a difference,  but I  preferred it with the cups in even though I don't need them."
4.0,"Nice quality, but, runs extremely too big for the size.  I suggest ordering a size smaller!  (and, remember, I warned you!)"
4.0,"Visor does give me a bit of a headache but most do. Hopefully, I can bend the band to eliminate that problem."
4.0,I bought a large anticipating it to run smaller than expected and it fits perfectly. For reference I am around 142 pounds and 5'4&#34;.
4.0,I get alot of compliments for the price it's a nice piece of jewelry
4.0,Very..very... thin socks but they do appear to support the legs against fatigue.CAn easily be worn under another pair socks
4.0,"I have to wear a skirt to work some times and these are perfect in cold days. But it does run smaller than normal in size, so it fits tight. Wish they had more tan colors!"
4.0,I'm 5'4and a half and am an XS to a small in shirts a zero to one n pants this fits in the waist  the top part looked huge but fits ok not a perfect fit in the top but close good quality except for the button slits which have string shedding! But looks exactly like the pic
4.0,Was good for price
4.0,These pants are super comfy and fit great! They do leave behind a black residue on my legs and sheets though.
4.0,Nice dress and got lots of compliments on it.  Slightly short waisted.
4.0,"Already this is my favorite dress, love the strings and the length of this dress."
4.0,"I like this jacket so much that there are no negative words just one correction which is the jack-hammer tool held by the bumble bee looks like a machine gun & I can't have that so I will have to explain that this jacket does not promote violence but respect for the Navy, cleaning our streets & community also did not expect a reversible jacket that is so cool on both sides. Generally, jackets that are reversible (at least the ones that I've purchased) were not this intricately detailed-- what a beautiful jacket. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is the jack-hammer looks like a machine gun & I must explain &#34;NO WAY&#34; will I ever promote violence."
4.0,the sleeve were to tight.
4.0,literally what the picture shows I love them. they are a bit long but really comfortable
4.0,"Very cute shirt! Bought to wear to work on Halloween with a chunky orange sweater in place of a costume. Shipping was extremely fast, I got my shirt next-day.<br /><br />As far as fit goes, I was kind of surprised to find the small a lot smaller than I expected considering this is unisex sizing. Based on other reviews, I expected a small to be slightly oversized on me (I'm female, 5'7&#34;, 140 lbs and lean). I wanted an oversized fit, but this is pretty snug on me. Not uncomfortably tight and it's actually very flattering, so I will keep the small, I just thought it would be bigger. I'd say size up from your usual size if you're a man or if you're a woman looking for a more oversized fit. Overall happy with the purchase and will be keeping the shirt."
4.0,Im 5'5 and weight 115lbs I have a small chest too so I ordered a Small and it fit me a lil big but I put the belt and it helped a little just my chest area was still left with room overall beautiful dress.
4.0,"Am, not bad, awesome quality but be careful with the sizes... M is perfect i would not recomend go with L size... never"
4.0,Bought these for my faughter to wear in a wedding. They fit great and matched the dresses perfectly.
4.0,I liked that it came with an instrument for the pin removal for adjusting the band but mine ended up bending. I was able to get two of the pins out before that happened. I plan on going to a store with a jewelry counter to adjust it for me. I love the style of the watch & it doesn't look cheap for the price. The band was very loose but I do have a small wrist. I plan on buying a few more in different styles & colors.
4.0,"It's a nice top and I liked the length (past the butt, hits mid-thigh) and material (not too thin or cheap), but just not for me because of the size/fit.  I ordered both a small and medium and neither were flattering to my figure.  It's too much material at the bottom because of the pockets, which makes my hips/upper thighs stick out more.  I am 5'4&#34;, 155 lbs. and have a pear-shape, so straight lined tunics are better for me.  If you have a straighter shape or carry more weight around the midsection, this top may flatter you."
4.0,"These make a great gift and have strong sentimental value for me. The quality is alright, definitely not the most sturdy cufflinks I've had. The locking mechanism feels slightly loose as does the adhesive to the chess pieces. But, they make a statement, I like them, and they are quite presentable as a gift or for regular wear."
4.0,"The boots were a birthday hit. A little big, but if you put socks on a size 5 foot the boots are great."
4.0,The dress is lovely!! Just a little too tight around the chest area.
4.0,I like the quality of the fabric but it was too roomy throught the torso. I wish there had been an extra small.
4.0,This is very cute but it was very hard to initially get on the window. But after it was very cute.
4.0,"I truly love the butterfly pattern since I am an avid butterfly freak -- and I really needed some bags like this. I haven't had the chance to use one yet due to the maddening folding directions.  It's almost like origami!  I am hoping that if I keep looking at the directions, I'll get it right.  On the very positive side, they feel sturdy & the fact that they can be washed is fantastic.  I've heard a lot of great things about these bags, they are quite impressive.  Quick delivery & great price!"
4.0,"I ordered the Blue Floral Flower Print, side pockets, high waist, floor-length maxi dress and love it! It just arrived and I tried it on immediately. It's comfortable, fits great and I'm looking forward to wearing it for Easter Sunday! Now I need one in pink with short sleeves."
4.0,"This ring is definately worth the affordable price. It is by no means a high dollar looking ring. It is delicate and pretty, but I'm sure it will wear out with time. But still, a really great option for that special girl you want to show your affection towards."
4.0,The sunglasses itself is a great quality. However the arm frame is too small it feels like crushing my head. I wish they put like springs or open wider. The lens frame size is perfect but the arm is crushing making it the size is not proportional. I guess i will just gave it to my little brother who has smaller head than me. My head is not even that big.
4.0,"If you’re looking for a high quality dress, I wouldn’t recommend. But being you’re on amazon looking for a casual dress, I would assume it’s not a high priority. With that, I am 5’2 125lbs and a 32C, got a size small and it fits better than expected. With a regular bra it’s a little tight in the chest, but I won’t be wearing a regular bra with this dress. Length is fine for me, but I’m scared to wash it. Fabric is pretty thin, but perfect for Florida weather. I had to cut off multiple threads after taking it out of the bag. And the only thing that bothers me is that the buttons are not straight on the chest area. But after looking at other reviews pictures it looks like that’s the norm. If that doesn’t bother you, then definitely get this dress. I’m going to keep just because I’m in love with the pattern and flowy skirt."
4.0,Warning: Does not come with hardware!<br />It's just the strap. Make sure you buy the hardware you need before buying
4.0,Color is close but not as vibrant. The metal framing and pole are a little thinner then I have had before but have held up fine so far. The umbrella material is definitely thinner then it am used.. but still decent.. so far so good but can't comment on the fading or full sturdiness until using it a bit longer
4.0,Zipper not functioning smoothly.
4.0,Thin material. Easily gets wrinkled especially after washing. Comfortable though. Size fits well. I like it oversized. I’m 5’2 & 146 lbs. & ordered large.
4.0,They were easier to get on.
4.0,"very nice item for parties, i think would be more used by the younger generation. wished it had glass instead of plastic but well worth the price."
4.0,"2XL shorts had an 11.25"" inseam. The description was technically correct (""11.25 - 12.25"") but buying the largest size gave the shortest inseam. It also states ""100% risk free no questions asked"" except for the return shipping costs and 10% re-stocking fee."
4.0,Gag gift
4.0,"Very cute! If you have thicker thighs size up for a looser fit in the hip area. Otherwise, very stylish."
4.0,We thought there would be a little extra room as he is just entering a size 3.  But this fits his foot exactly with no room for growth.
4.0,"Very happy with this purchase, the watch look Luxury brand. For the price it was worth buying."
4.0,too stiff so it didn't conform to my head thus looked bulky. Maybe better for a guys head.
4.0,little bigger starfish than I thought it was going to be but still pretty cute and a very good product
4.0,"Keychain is very pretty, and quite heavy. I don't grab my keys by this keychain, so hoping to avoid the complaint I see from most people here that the arm has already broken off."
4.0,"these worked out great, but I knew what I was getting into as I purchase this pant in JC Penney.  I think they are great and comfy for work.  They feel softer than a jean, but they are better than slacks."
4.0,My son loves the watch. Only complaint is the face seems to scratch easier than it should.
4.0,"This is a lovely necklace but the charms are slightly smaller than expected. The floating charm is sealed shut with 6 green rhinestones, an oval with &#34;hope&#34; engraved in it, and a heart with inlaid clear rhinestones. This charm is dime sized. The tree of life is slightly smaller than a dime. The oblong &#34;dream&#34; engraved charm has the s925 engraved on the back.<br /><br />I'm not really a fan of this chain. It's kind of like a box chain but the links are oval. It kinks a lot. It's easy to unkink but I don't like how often it kinks. You can't change the chain. The center ends of the chain are connected to a circle jump ring that the charms hang on. This is an 18-inch chain with a lobster claw clasp and no length extender.<br /><br />Ratings (Out of five stars):<br />Chain Quality: ★★★<br />Chain Length: ★★★★★<br />Charm Quality: ★★★★★<br />Style: ★★★★★<br />Value: ★★★★<br /><br />Overall rating: 22 out of 25 stars / 4.4 Star Average<br /><br />📌 SUMMARY: I like the theme and style of this necklace. The charms are cute. The metal is durable and attractive. The only thing I don't like is how easily the chain kinks.<br />__________________________________________________________<br /><br />I received this product complimentary from NINAQUEEN for quality testing purposes.

4.0,"Bought this scrub cap so I could wear it while working on a covid-19 unit. It is super cute, pretty comfortable, stays put. I just wish I had buttons to help hold my mask."
4.0,well made not real black kinda gray black still looks good
4.0,"When this dress first arrived it smelled SO BAD! But after I washed it (like 7 times), the smell went away and it fits really well. Its very soft and flattering. I wear a 38C bra and have a pretty big butt but it lays really pretty."
4.0,"I have a pretty wide face and a lot of the fitover-type of sunglasses are too tight, even without my eyeglasses. This one not only fits but also looks like normal sunglasses. I love the surprised look on people's faces when they realize that I have eyeglasses under these."
4.0,"I like this coat very much! I expected it to be a little warmer than it was--it's a bit light.  However, with a bulky sweater and a scarf, I felt very warm in 30 degree Fahrenheit weather--I wore it while travelling around Boston (mostly by bus and walking) during the past week when there was quite a bit of snow and a significant drop in the temperature. Also, I just love the look of it and the hood is awesome!"
4.0,"I really like this swim skirt. It comes up to my belly button and down just to the top of my thigh, so the coverage is awesome for those trying to hide a few extra pounds in the middle without having to worry about low rise or covering themselves up like a mummy. It has attached panty and built in pockets and seems well made. It is a little large I am more like a small 16 and I bought the 14 and it isn't snug at all. I plan on buying another color. 4 stars because I have not worn it in the water yet."
4.0,I had purchased Medium thinking it was the perfect size but was a little larger than you expected. Its loose but not too lose. My spouse has been wearing it and loves the material.
4.0,Good elastic belt. Nice front design.  I like the thick belts because it gives you a shape.  Lately the fashion use of small thin belts is not for me since I have a curvy figure.  You can dress up your outfits with this black elastic belt.
4.0,Very pretty! Fits true to size. Very thick and warm
4.0,"I purchased this to wear with my Garmin  vivomove. I am pleased with the quality and look, especially for the price"
4.0,"It was bigger then expected,but love the material and everything else about it."
4.0,Based on reviews I ordered down a size. I usually wear a large but ordered a medium. The shirt it a little tight in the waisted but very loose in the bust area. Glad I went down a size with the shirt fitting as loose as it does. Color is exactly as pictured and fabric is a good quality. Overall I am happy with my purchase and would purchase from this company again.
4.0,Great corset not steel bone but good Quality runs small I'm normally an extra large I ordered a 3x fit perfectly
4.0,"These work well.  I needed something in the car to use as sunglasses over my prescription glasses and these fit the bill.  I went with the smaller size of these and that was a good call since these are roughly a quarter-inch larger on the bottom and far sides than my glasses.  They're very easy to get on and off.<br /><br />On the cons side, you do look like a complete dork and they aren't the greatest at blocking the glare from the sun.  If you need something to throw on quickly where no one will see you, such as in your car like me, then these will work fine."
4.0,Fits tight so size up.
4.0,worked great other than it pulls on the skin and hair on the arms
4.0,"The spice color this lightweight scarf is beautiful. It is a rich red that is universally flattering. The scraf itself is 100% polyester and trimmed with nylon lace. The fabric is soft and sheer. Versatile, it can be used as a scarf, shawl, belf or headcover. It travels well. Although the directions say to hand wash I have successfully laundered in a lingerie bag in cold water on the gentle cycle and line dried. Turned out perfect. The only criticism I have is osf the lace trim. I do not like the raw, unfinsihed edges. I realize that the finge, eyelashlook is popular but to me it looks sloppy and cheapens an otherwise attractive accessory. Not a deal breaker because it is otherwise a lovely scarf."
4.0,Nice bag just the right size. I don't need the detachable shoulder strap.The double top handles fit well on my shoulder. I wished it had extra compartments. I purchased the coffee and now thinking about a buying a different color.
4.0,Great Product but they are really big. not warned in listing. stabbed me in the shoulders most of the night
4.0,"Cycling shorts are usually so boring (all black!) so I was excited to find something more interesting. These are decent overall, but the sizing is weird. They fit my legs and butt well, but they're way too big around the waist. That will be covered by a jersey though, so I'll wear them anyway!"
4.0,a bit smaller than pictured
4.0,Cute. Cheap but will work for what I need.
4.0,Nice socks to wear around the house in slippery floors.
4.0,"Pleasantly surprised. I ordered for a costume and I do think it's worth the great price, although a gem fell off it was an easy fix with some hot glue."
4.0,"I love this shirt, it's light and comfortable. The only thing I with it had was a front pocket, other than that it's great."
4.0,I got so many compliments from staff and students on the dress it’s unbelievable.
4.0,"I received this pretty quickly. It is a nice, sturdy material. Only downfall that I have with it, is that it did not come in the colors as shown in the picture. It came as a yellow color instead of the pink."
4.0,"I liked the product.  The material is very good, tough.  The engraving was not very deep, difficult to see and read.  I had thought about returning them, but I lost them into the magic land of working on cars.  Should have removed them with all the crawling around and carryings; yes I have done this before.<br />I like your products."
4.0,Love this bag! Bought it for my work bag since I work outside but wanted a nice bag to have when I need to run my errands after work. It’s very substantial and LOVE the dark brown color. Very nice bag....  perfect for me !
4.0,The gray one has a softer fabric. It does the job
4.0,"Service was fast, I just wish they offered half sizes bc the new one is too small :( but still, great customer service and production times!"
4.0,This top has a nice fit.  I bought another in a different color and it was exactly the opposite - the neck was tight -  and I sent it back.
4.0,The swimsuit fit good i ordered a large and I'm a 130 lbs. so I  suggest you  go up a size from  what you usually wear .
4.0,I was pleased with this purchase
4.0,Loved the shirt. A little large but thats okay.
4.0,Like it but it gives the Dreaded Zuni-Boob!
4.0,Very Cute. But the sizing is off. I bought one for a 18 mth. that turned out to be the same size as the 2-4 yr.
4.0,Like the color and design
4.0,"It took a while for these to get to me in the mail.  I was looking for something to help me see more clearly in the dark and rain when driving to and from work.  I think they certainly were worth the money.  It is so difficult to see on rural roads and in brightly lit areas when its dark and especially when its raining.  These glasses fit over my regular eyeglasses or comfortably when I am wearing contact lenses.  They cut the glare from street lights, buildings, and most importantly on coming traffic.  They also seem to make it easier to see the painted lines on the dark roads.<br />I would recommend them."
4.0,young man is very happy about them he takes them everywhere he goes ...even to school.
4.0,"They look really nice and are perfect for cosplay, the only problem is that one of the rings is a little opened (from where it secures the earring) and then you have to use a tool to close it a little more, otherwise you might end up losing it. Other than that it is perfect"
4.0,The dress is very cute.  but very short
4.0,Made well for 5$.
4.0,These are very cute and stylish glasses for the computer. They do the trick to block out the blue light that bothers my eyes after looking at a monitor for hours.
4.0,Would give 5 stars if lens were in both ends and chain was longer
4.0,Not thong. Hard to west with clothing to have no panty line.
4.0,Super comfy. Runs a little big. Kept it since I wear longer tops.
4.0,Nice all purpose shirt. Just as advertised!
4.0,I was taken back by how grey it was. Was hoping it’d be more on the black/darker side. But it fits good and seems soft.
4.0,"It came in the new colors, so I was pleased.<br />But it was extremely hard to get the air bubbles out of the PITT."
4.0,"Got two of these, one medium for myself and a large for my daughter. The both fit perfectly. Material is a nice, soft one. Pattern is just as lovely as in the picture."
4.0,Loved these.  Use them for dance.  Did not love how fast the elastic wore down and rolled on itself.
4.0,Nicely crafted... Looks expensive
4.0,I absolutely adore these leggings! They fit perfectly and I have had no problem with them sliding down on me when I'm wearing them. These are great for wearing on their own of under other clothing in the cooler months. Unfortunately the material that they are made of attracts all types of fuzz and shows picks fairly easily.
4.0,It’s such an amazing color. The fit was nice; it’s definitely true to size. Pretty in pink for sure.
4.0,I love the appearance and the length of the necklace.  My only issue is that it is a bit more flimsy and could bend fairly easily.
4.0,True color match.
4.0,These masks are good sized & have adjustable ear loops- which is good. They are well made & a good value. The only downside is that they are polyester & can tend to “steam” your face when you wear them.
4.0,The color is not lite pink it is more raspberry
4.0,The sleeves were extremely tight in the shoulder part. The strings that the were in another review were present but I just used a lighter to burn them and it was ok. I wear a 16 to 18 and I got a XL because I needed asap. I would suggest get a XXL it was stretchy but not that stretchy. Overall it did the job I looked nice and I was happy with the product and outcome.
4.0,"I am going to wear this as a beach cover up.  Has a funky waist band, the sewing is rather odd but will be great as a bathing suit cover up.  The twist is cute, but it is thin and I think see through"
4.0,"Believe it or not, these are my first sports bras. I wear them to sleep in, they’re comfortable."
4.0,Was missing a stone
4.0,"This bag is very cute and great statement piece.<br />Two things to note<br />1. I wish it had a way to close the top. I could see my clumsy self tipping it over and things falling out.<br />2. The embellishments come off easily. After one use one of the flowers fell off. It's an easy fix, but others have had their embellishments fall off as well. So it's just something to watch for."
4.0,"my son like it,the size and color is good"
4.0,"The sweatshirt fits perfectly, it's ultra lightweight and super thin but durable. If you're looking for a sweatshirt that looks cool and keeps you warm, then this is not the one for you.<br />Shipping was excellent, I received within a week. I would purchase from the vendor again and will probably order a couple more in different colors."
4.0,"It is very cute.  Fits as expected.  Definitely more of a shirt weight than a jacket though.  Overall, good purchase."
4.0,"I got this for working in a salon, where I have to wear all black. I wanted something long and lightweight to cover my behind when I wear leggings. This is very comfortable and nice and long. It's perfect to pair with shorter shirts and leggings. I think it will work well even when wearing an apron. It's definitely very light - it's made of t-shirt type material. It'll be really great in spring and fall, but maybe not so helpful when it's really cold. Since it's so thin and stretchy, it does behave a little strangely stretched over a long sleeve shirt.<br /><br />Overall, I really like this cardigan and plan to get a lot of use out of it."
4.0,"Nice, sturdy and light. It would be especially good for leaving it in my minimalist purse and have it be available when I need it. Initially it seems a little pricey, but then it doesn't have a label, &#34;made inChina.&#34; If it's really made here in the US and not using slave labor, I'd happily pay the price for a good product."
4.0,"I’m thinking about getting an actual nose piercing so I wanted to see how it would look beforehand. They are very cute. I love the designs. However, eventually they tend to slip off. I lost 2 of them somewhere."
4.0,Perfect for what my mom needs. Sometimes she presses the wrong button on the back and someone has to reset it!
4.0,While it’s a very comfortable bonnet I think the actual head band can be a little smaller. Bonnets with a wider width tie head band tend to rise/pull up towards the crown of head causing your hair to pull up and flatten out hairstyle. Not good for loc’s!
4.0,The shirts itself were really cute but the wrong date was placed on it and mixed with a different shirt just be sure to check and recheck your order
4.0,I love these socks; they are so warm and cozy!!
4.0,"The case was what I had ordered, except for the band color inside. The picture shows grey but the bands that I got were yellow. A couple reviewers mentioned that their cases were a gold color, I was a little worried about this, but the one I received was what had been ordered: chrome. The catch a release button is a tad wonky, and I have to apply a lot of pressure for it to release or snap shut, but what can you expect for the price?<br />The seller shipped quickly and it arrived in a timely manner, as well as being adequately packaged so that it didn't get scratched to hell in the process."
4.0,Item was okay but just didn't fit me as expected but it was well made and a great price.
4.0,I purchased these for a costume party when they came i was suprised by the case that they came with. They fit great are made sturdy
4.0,"Comfortable and nice summer shirt. I’m not sure how well made it is given all of the loose stitching, but it’s a good casual tank. It can be layered easily. Color is nice too."
4.0,It’s not the most amazing Halloween costume but for the price it is great.
4.0,Very comfortable and warm! One strap broke on one sock....no biggie for me!
4.0,Looking forward to some sunshine!
4.0,Love the product.... I even ordered another for Halloween.  I wish it was a little larger though.  I stretched it out since I have a large head (hat size).  But I still like wearing it at work because I never leave a room without it.
4.0,"I really like this bag.  My only issue, and it's not a product issue, is that it is much larger than I thought it would be, so it took some getting used to for me.  Quality is great and it's well made.  Pockets and storage everywhere, and when I put ALL my stuff in it from my old bag, this one still looked empty."
4.0,"I gave it to my wife and she loves it because I said and I could send it back and she wouldn't let me, so I guess she likes it a lot!"
4.0,"Great and inexpensive terry bath rove. I was looking for a terry cloth robe and found this one.  It is NOT one of those extremely thick robes you get at fancy hotels, etc, but it does the job and washes well and doesn't cost that much."
4.0,"I was hoping this would be a compression shirt to help with post operative recovery. This is just a work out top. Although it is very soft and comfortable,  it isn't what I was looking for. I will still keep it since it can be used for workouts."
4.0,"I ordered an XL because I like tops baggy, but this fits like a large."
4.0,"I got the set in light pink color with palm trees, bubbles printed on it. I love the print, it's super cute. It's a perfect pajama set for summer nights or lounge around the house.<br /><br />With that being said, the sizing is not accurate. Please size up, you won't regret it. The shorts are not the best fitting, but the cute print makes up for it :) The cami fits funnily around the armholes, but the shirt can cover the flaws. The shirt is very well made and fits great.<br /><br />It's made of some sort of shiny looking polyester fabric that feels silky. I have washed it in the washer-dryer without any issues.<br /><br />Overall, I like the set. It looks super cute and comfortable to wear."
4.0,Pants were long
4.0,"Real leather. Soft and comfortable. Nice design that looks hand crafted. It's only about an inch wide. Would be more awesome if it was wider like a regular leather cuff,  maybe 2-2 1/2 inches? I have seen the Anubis one and I think there's one with an ankh, but would like  to see an Egyptian cat and  also a scarab one as well. oh, and also be available in black leather."
4.0,"My husband has a wallet he loves, so I wasn't able to convince him to go with the RFID wallet. Instead, I bought this insert. He said it was very easy to &#34;install&#34; and it gives him peace of mind. I'm only giving it a 4 out of 5, though, because it hasn't been &#34;tested.&#34; Otherwise, seems like a great product...if it works."
4.0,"I love these, they're cute, comfy and warm.  They run a bit large in my opinion, but for slippers that's fine."
4.0,Great looks and fit for my son.
4.0,cheap watch but works well and looks good.
4.0,"I got rid of my wallet and use this to combine phone and wallet. There is not really any good options available in this design that are high quality. This will last you for a little while, so be ready to replace writhing 3-5 months.<br />I bought this in May 2019. I’m writing this in October.<br />The glue holding the fabric to the plastic softens infers heat and turns into some rubbery stuff that stretches and comes off.<br />I still love the color and simplicity, just wish for some higher quality, as I don’t want my cards to fall out."
4.0,"I’m a big fan of linen for it’s casual look and feel. This shirt is mostly cotton (70%) but still feels like it’s mostly flax linen. It’s pretty cool (temperature wise) and comfortable. I ordered my usual size and fit was as a fair bit larger than expected (medium; 6’1”; 165 lbs, bust 40”, shoulders 18”). Follow the sizing chart closely. It seems like it would’ve otherwise have been a nice cut and a good shape, although, the mandarin collar makes it naturally rest a bit more formal than it looks on the model in the picture. I guess I need to start working out now. Seams seem well hemmed and uniform. Overall, for $22, it’s a decent price, just wish it fit better. 4/5 stars."
4.0,Fit real well. Good product.
4.0,Runs a little small--but I like wearing it.
4.0,gave to wife as small Hanukkah gift. she loved it. simple. light. casual chic.
4.0,"The fit is a bit large or I have a small head. But either way, it is a warm satin lined winter hat. It just sits low on my face. To adjust for this, I just have a wide cuff/folded over portion"
4.0,"I'm a 40F so my bras are in for a lot of work. This one is pretty close to perfect - decent support (though still need a 2nd bra for running or jumping jacks) and reasonable fit. My only real beef is the stupid back closing design: 2 hooks, a pointless and obnoxious keyhole opening, and then another 2 hooks. Might look cute but makes it fairly difficult to get the thing fastened! Otherwise a good bra."
4.0,"These are SO cute! I bought a 2X and my pant size is 16/18. When the package arrived I was a bit scared that they were too small. However, I removed the drawstring and wore them for about 30 minutes and they stretched out enough to be at my comfort level. Some shorts stretch out TOO much, but these were just right for my size."
4.0,Super cute and fit better than I expected. Its always a toss up with these  shirts and can sometimes run really small. I am somewhere between an XL and XXL on top with store brands so on here I always get an XXL or 3xl if available.  I do find it to be itchy though but only on my stomach. I have worn a few times and watched a lot but it is still a bit itchy. This might be an issue for someone that has sensitive skin. Overall worthwhile purchase to add to my Halloween shirt collection.
4.0,Smaller and thinner than expected. Copper color but cute!
4.0,The item was as described and fit perfectly! I wear a 14 and ordered a large. I love it.
4.0,collar not as large as in picture. heavy dute magnet is used to close. have to be careful or magnet pulls material. also magnet is black so can be seen. about size of dime. That's a little disappointing but so comfy light and warm. so i do recommend. Especailly for price.
4.0,Nice dress but little too snug had to return it.
4.0,"It's beautiful, after much waiting it finally came in even tho it's stamped 925 it's not going to be pure silver. It's sterling silver which I assume means it's plated only..But for the price you can not expect it to be pure silver..and even tho you can adjust it ,I think it's meant more for a small wrist and I wouldn't force it much to open it cause you may break it and it would be a shame to break something so Beautiful just to try and get it on a bigger wrist.."
4.0,"Nice, warm, comfortable. Fuzzy on the inside, but not super heavy. Good for spring days, will be good for summer nights as well. Nice design. Thanks."
4.0,"Arrived on time in new condition! It's a perfect size and has great inside pockets and a divider for easy organization.  The mouth of the purse is a little small, but I have not had any issues with it yet.  I bought the blue purse and it wasn't as bright as the picture but it's still a beautiful color.  Overall a good purse for the price!"
4.0,A good value for some &#34;basic&#34; ties
4.0,I love the color and texture of these. The bottoms fit well but the top is probably too small for me.
4.0,It’s thinner than I thought it would be but still cute.
4.0,"When I got these I was excited to wear them, I had them since September and just the other day the casing fell off the setting. I am going to glue it back, but other than that they're great."
4.0,My daughter loved it. It was perfect
4.0,First wear a bit snug but after a week fits perfectly!
4.0,"Very pleased with fit, the length wasn't long as I wanted on one of these skirts I ordered.  But overall-- good"
4.0,Nice fit and fast delivery! 👌
4.0,Loved the style of this dress and got the size it recommended based on measurements (Large). It fit well except there seemed to be a lot of extra fabric at the bust. I’m pretty busty so that’s not a problem I usually have. The fabric hung off the sides and I wasn’t a fan so I returned it. Not sure if a smaller size would have been a fix or not
4.0,Fits me fine as I'm a size small woman.
4.0,"It's a nice top, fits great,I just thought it will be little bit longer,as the image gives this impression but still happy with it!"
4.0,Great dress - little see through though.
4.0,"A bit longer than I expected, will not wear daily, only evening wear."
4.0,thicker would have been better...too thin per my son's taste
4.0,I wish it would be a bit taller of a shirt for my height 😔
4.0,"Not a bad nato. Looks great but it’s a bit short. I have a 7 1/4” wrist and I’m unable to fold it. It is usable and looks great. For the price, I would buy again."
4.0,"This is a great watch, I enjoy wearing it, and it gets quite a few compliments.  The construction of the band clasp was shoddy, though, and I had to replace it less than two months after purchasing the watch.  Other than that, this watch is FANTASTIC!"
4.0,"It does run small, but looks great."
4.0,"Looks like it does in the picture. I always get compliments on it. It did have a loose thread on the back of it, but that's no big deal. I love wearing it."
4.0,It's a little baggy for a small but i like it.
4.0,It fit a little tight of the shoulder
4.0,"Great earrings.  Just recieved them today. They did not have any flaws<br /> They are big, but not huge. Also, they are light weight. I'm very pleased with my purchase. Just what I was looking for."
4.0,"Excellent seller, excellent product! I love it!"
4.0,Fits great and are comfy
4.0,Perfect for my 8 year old to wear all the time!
4.0,"I loved the idea of getting these buttons for the moms of a bridal shower I was helping to plan. They both loved them! The only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is the buttons were a little off center. The 'Mother of the Groom' button was almost touching the edge of the ribbon. I ordered them a little too late so I wasn't able to try and get them replaced, but they still worked perfectly!"
4.0,I hate wearing hose or tights but these are nice. Fit well.
4.0,material and fit is good
4.0,It was cute. Ordered my regular size and it was big. But that's okay
4.0,Didn't expect the suede material but fits well and holding up to damp weather so far.
4.0,Looks like its good quality so far. Was suppose to be new but came with obvious tobacco spit stains. Not a big deal because thats what we plan to use it for. But if I would have wanted it to be a collectible I wouldn't have been happy. We'll see over time how it holds up.
4.0,One of my fave running shirts.
4.0,"This was a tad big on my 12 month old daughter. She is tall and skinny though, but over all a very cute outfit!"
4.0,I really love the way these leggings feel and look! Very flattering and comfortable! I took off one star from the rating because they are already piling pretty bad.
4.0,Looks sweet looking. Warm and exactly what I wanted.
4.0,"I think this bathing suit is super cute.  I looked at the size chart and ordered the largest size available.  I usually wear a size 14 pants and a size 38 bra.  The pants fit perfectly.  Since I have a large breast cup size, the top does not hold as much as I would like.  It covers, but I am a grandmother and would like to have more material.  I will wear the bathing suit to the pool.  I think it is pretty and sexy.  I will not wear it with my 22 month old grandson,as he clings since he does not know how to swim.  I may be completely exposed with him holding on! I do think it will be great to lie by the Pool and tan!  I like the style and color.  I would purchase this suit in a different color.  I think it is a great sexy suit for a not old grandma!  I received this bathing suit at a reduced price in return for an honest review."
4.0,"It was a night event so it didn’t matter as much, it would of been more noticeable during the day. I will definitely wear it again."
4.0,"A bit big, but not so much that it looks bad or falls off, but just enough that there is some growing room!"
4.0,It fits as expected but a little short.  I'm 5'11 80 lbs so its shorter than I wanted but still wearable. The material seems ok.
4.0,Nothing is perfect. They fit nicely.
4.0,So looks like I ordered a L it says 5 on it. Design is not printed onto the fabric so I'm not too worried about the design fading. They're pretty comfy kinda warmer than expected though. They have a bit of a silky feel to them
4.0,The strap is a good thickness and color-lot less money than the alternative and price is good too!
4.0,Fast shipper...good lenses...frames are brittle...had in my pocket...bent over snapped the frame...Have had dozens of glasses in my pocket before and have not snapped them in half...never the less...purchased a second pair.
4.0,"Great idea, just a little bugger than expected"
4.0,"I bought this necklace to replace a similar necklace.<br /><br />The chain is dainty and I would prefer if it were longer, however that isn't a big issue as I can use an extender or get a longer chain.<br /><br />It looks really cute."
4.0,Beautiful sandals 😊
4.0,giftee lives in midwest.  says they are comfortable and warm and loves the color
4.0,"When I read the other reviews, I thought these would be really cheap and fall apart after one use.  However, the hats I received are made from a woven plastic, which is perfect for my granddaughters to play with for our tea party.  These are made small to fit a child's head, but that is what I intended.  I love the colors.  They are as pictured in this picture."
4.0,Light and attractive.
4.0,It's comfortable and nice but the material is cheaper than it looks in the picture.
4.0,"This is a great bad. Sturdy yet light weight, made in the US, both handles and a strap so you can wear it one way or the other depending on what else you have to carry.<br />The only thing I would change is the handles should be a bit longer so it could more comfortably fit under my shoulder but unless you are super skinny that is a bit tight.<br />Also, I returned the Sterling bag and got a red one instead. Sterling really is silver and not a really light grey and red just worked better for me.<br />I get a lot of compliments on my red Harveys bag."
4.0,"LOVE this pendant...I gave four stars because the chain is very cheap. Will buy a new one before giving this gift. PS, I just had to get one for myself, too!!!"
4.0,"It's ugly, it's a Christmas sweater/shirt. Can't go wrong."
4.0,I love my other XOXO boots but not thrilled about the zipper location on this pair and how they do not zip/unzip all the way to the top. Makes it a little difficult to put on over skinny jeans.
4.0,"Cute boot cuffs, I got them at a discount in exchange for my honest review. They came quickly and are super warm. Great quality and comfort! I would recommend them to anyone who was looking to buy cuffs!!"
4.0,Ok material is sheerer than expected
4.0,"Nice vest, but runs small. I wear a ladies size 12, bought the large/x-large, and it fits okay. Also recommend replacing the clips on the side; I did.  The clips that come on the vest are hard to open, and I suspect they break easily either because they're a thin plastic or through sheer frustration. I would have given this 5 stars had the clips been better."
4.0,"Loved them, but I put them in the washer and they got destroyed. Getting another pair right now."
4.0,"Bought these for Halloween costumes.  They seem to be a little hard to open sometimes, but not bad at all for the price."
4.0,Una de mis favoritas me gusto el precio<br />Nada mal para una máscara
4.0,"This is a great pant and is very dressy for work and I love the fact that they have the 30 inch length for us short legged gals! the fit is great once you get it on, but the only thing is that there is not enough stretch in the waistband and barely makes it over my butt. My suggestion is to put just a little bit more elastic in the waist band for us curvy gals so we can get it on without struggling."
4.0,"I ordered the green, blue and grey scarfs.  All the same patterns but in these different colours.  Scarfs as shown are true to photos.  Very pretty but material is a bit too gausy.  Still great for price and do like them."
4.0,"First off, this dress is gorgeous. I ordered it in purple. It has a flattering fit, and it's not see-through. I ordered the small and I wear a size 2/4. While the dress itself has a flattering fit, is is LONG. Definitely not suited for the petite, even with heels. I'm am 5'1&#34; and the dress drags on the ground. I put on 2&#34; heels, and it still drags on the ground. And it would cost more to tailor it than what I paid for the dress. Sadly, it's going to be returned :("
4.0,"order xxlarge as many reviews said they run a size small, glad I did. they fit perfectly. super lightweight. only wish the cargo pockets were on the side of the leg, not in front. Im pretty sure putting something in those will drive me nuts. trying them out in Tahoe this weekend."
4.0,I love this dress. It's nice and lightweight but that also makes it just slightly see through (or at least in the purple color that I bought) Also I have to pair it with a belt at the waist or else it kinda just hangs there- but it might just be my body type.
4.0,"Good band, looks great. Was a bit difficult to adjust size."
4.0,I like them and will probably buy again.
4.0,Definitely NOT compression tanks but not terrible for lounge or workout tanks. I would buy again.
4.0,Nice bag. It is just the size I need for shopping trips
4.0,Beautiful dress.  Lovely prints.  Receive compliments every time I wear it!  Fabric is a little thin.
4.0,Great looking sweater that fits as expected. The button holes are a bit small making it difficult to get it buttoned and unbuttoned but otherwise first rate.
4.0,run a bit small but can make them work wish they made them one size larger
4.0,Love this shirt the material is great not cheap and thin it's actually a little thick and somewhat stretchy but not like I wanted it too. I'm an XL but I always get a XX-L because I like to wear loose fitting shirts around my stomach area due to a hernia I have bulging out right about my bellybutton that I got during labor and is very noticeable but the XX-L was between a Large and an XLarge.
4.0,Well-made and can go with any outfit/color.
4.0,Good product.  Very easy to install.
4.0,I wish it were a little bigger since I carry a lot of stuff. But it's cute and functional.
4.0,Versatile scarf.  Can be tied in many different ways.  Pretty color.
4.0,"It fit the waist and bust perfectly but it showed a bit too much of my rear end for my comfort level. My husband said it looked great but my kids didn’t want me to wear it to the neighborhood pool. Hahaha<br />I’m 5’3, 130lbs 34b for reference.<br />I returned it."
4.0,"Nice soft fabric, feels very comfy.<br />Can wear with flats of heels.<br />Am 5'3 185 lbs 40DDD bought XL<br />35 %cotton 65 %polyester"
4.0,"I love this material. Soft, not clingy and not hot. When I opened the package there was a definite smell to the dress ( like mold), but I couldn’t see anything wrong with it. After washing it ( just added to the regular load of wash) it came out just perfect - no smell, didn’t need ironing and was just fine. I will definitely buy other dresses from this seller."
4.0,It runs big. Bought the medium for my 5 year old son as that's what he wears in other brands but this fits like a large. Otherwise...it was good quality and the graphics were great
4.0,"Well, first I should say that the bras are well made and super snuggly. However, I bought them for my almost 9 year old who is just developing. These bras are straight up padded 🤣 as much as she enjoys having boobs with it on, I do not. Haha! Would be good for girls who are more ready for a padded bra 😬"
4.0,Have sent it back for a Med
4.0,Dark blue not as light as picture but worked fine. Fit my 6 & 7 yr old girls well.
4.0,"This fits wider than a Bloch leotard, but the material of this Capezio leotard is thicker, double paneled in the front, and has a more cotton-like feel.  My daughter needed a more slender fit, so we ended up going with Bloch."
4.0,I sent this to my sister for her Grandson She is happy about the fabric and fit for the low cost James
4.0,"Short posts, locking backing, petite profile...love them!"
4.0,This dress is do cute!! I wanted the other color but the gray blue came in my size. I have a large bust and it fit well. It's a little loose around my waist though. I agree with another reviewer in that you should replace the belt with one of your own. The fabric is THIN. Not see through but definitely a summer dress. The kind of thin that if the wind blows too hard you might Marilyn Monroe it a little. Cute dress. Definitely worth a go.
4.0,LOTS of windows and big enough to slip cards in easily.
4.0,Loved the material and pattern just wish shirt was longer
4.0,"Be careful on sizing chart. I'm 5'4 and 135 pounds. When I measured myself it pointed me to Medium. It was big! Returned it ordered Small. So much better! And im absolutely loving it. Its long. Even w heels its slightly bit longer, but I can deal with it. Its very beautiful though. Ordered for my birthday so I will update w the pics then -&#62; update. Gorgeous! Got huge amount of compliments. But it was slipping down the entire time. The whole night I spent pulling it up."
4.0,"I bought this dress strictly for a fall party I will be having for my kids. Quality of the dress is great, the only thing I did not like was the sleeves were a bit tight and after a while they start to bother a bit, but I don’t mind it. But the one thing that did bother me was the collard flare part. I didn’t notice that part was straight instead of having some dimension like the sleeves flares have, which I’ve seen in many other dresses, but again, over all I’m happy with my purchase!"
4.0,"Quality construction, but a little larger than I expected.  It will come in handy when a wallet is not needed."
4.0,Basic sweatshirt. Good for everyday use
4.0,My niece look so cute. She love peppa pig her bedroom is Peppa so when I saw the outfit we had to have it.
4.0,"Smooth, high quality knit fabric. Looks exactly as pictured. Fits a little big, but hoping to shrink it after a wash or two."
4.0,"Nice quality socks. Stay on well, they won't work in ballet shoes but they work well for oxfords and loafers."
4.0,"Ordered two so that hubby and I can have matching bands. They are a lightweight which is fine, however, I took off a star as I don't think they are very sturdy for the long haul. He doesn't wear his to work, and I would not recommend it if you work with your hands and could hit the ring on a hard surface. I can see this breaking really easy.<br />The print pattern is fine, they are both fairy matched so I am assuming it is paper printed and then an epoxy inlay?? Not sure. Honestly for the price I could not be happier. I wear it with a small thin band but like to wear alone also. I wanted something that I could work out and be outdoors in without a fuss.<br />Both sizes ( mine a 7 and his a 13 ) fit true to size ( we were both sized at the jeweler previously)."
4.0,great product for the money my daughter was very happy with them
4.0,"Bought these for the bestie for her birthday, and she loves them! They are sooo adorable. She wears them every day! She was able to comfortably stretch her ears from the smallest to the third biggest.  The only reason she is stuck is because the second biggest is WWWAAAYYY bigger than the third biggest. Making it uncomfortable and painful to even attempt to gauge up.  Wish there was a size in between them. Had the same problem with the other shaped ones I purchased for myself."
4.0,"Normally take a size 9/10 so I ordered these XL. They ended up being absolutely huge! Requested a return. Other than being the wrong size, they seem like wonderful slippers though."
4.0,"Very satisfied, good material, good finish ,,, would put 5 stars if the strap was leather"
4.0,Cute pocket coin.
4.0,"Like the thickness of the tights but not a fan of fit in the waist area, the seams are in an awkward place. Overall, stayed in place and would recommend."
4.0,Keeps me warm...
4.0,After i bought these I bought a second pair a size smaller in pink. I like them both theyre nice and comfy for sleeping or if you wanted to do yoga.
4.0,As it says on the box
4.0,Love these aviator glasses which paid full price.  One pair came broken actually my favorite the gold with yellow mirror.  Over all I'm very satisfied wish I could've given a 5 1/2 stars
4.0,I’ve only worn the vest once while riding. The temperature was in the 50’s and the vest kept me comfortable.
4.0,"Consistent product. They are very thin but well made. Sometimes they stick together in the stack. They work great for a party activity, but they are not ideal for a permanent safari hat."
4.0,"Love the green color, size is bigger than I thought which is great, but top of pack with snaps is a little bit odd. Still really like it though for an overnight/weekend bag"
4.0,"I can't articulate the words to describe how much I love this bikini. It's super adorable, fits perfectly, and looks amazing on me!<br />A bit about me: I am 5'6, around 110 lbs, I generally wear a 34 B, to put it simply: I am very thin. So, I ordered a small. It fits perfectly! The tops fits just righty, the chest doesn't feel like it's saggy or too big on me in any way. Plus, the top is padded which I didn't know but is a huge bonus in my opinion. The bottoms are adorable. They fit perfectly and still give my bum that cheek peek that you want from your bikini.<br />Oh, not to mention I received the entire ensemble in less than four days. I am just beaming with the thought of the careless summer days I will get to spend in this suit! Go ahead, love yourself enough to buy one of these babies. You won't regret it!"
4.0,"Shades work great.  I can quickly switch from bright sunlight to inside viewing by just flipping them up.  The lenses are not flimsy, so the do tend to add some weight to your glasses."
4.0,"Great piece of jewlery. I couldn't wear it unfortunately because I ordered too big of a size but that's on me, not the company."
4.0,Great price and prompt delivery. Very pleased.
4.0,I would consider these medium weight rather than micro;  they are 'full cushion' and thick on the bottom and thin on the top of the foot. Fit is true to size. They were a slightly rougher than I expected from merino (but not really itchy) but didn't really notice after wearing for a while. Keep feet warm without getting sweaty. Machine washed and dried without any shrinkage. A bit pricey but good quality socks overall.
4.0,It fit great and easy to put on and tighten without someone helping.  Looked great!  when I got it though there were tiny rust spot near one of the lace up holes.
4.0,Nice lil piece to lounge around in & comfortable.
4.0,It is pretty but low quality. Should have expected this based on the price (duh). Fine for me but don't expect to fool anyone with this.
4.0,Really cute cover up.  Would be a cute dress with a slip underneath.  Sadly it is just too large for me. 5'2&#34; 110lbs. Would look great on a talker or larger girl.  The lace detail is so pretty.
4.0,Cute shirt. I ordered up a size XL. Thinking it would be a little baggy. The XL is more like a Medium/Large snug fit. I don’t know… really cute. But not a true fit.<br /><br />So if you normally wear a woman’s Med cut shirt order an XL.
4.0,A little difficult to put on. They will put back support  to keep earrings higher.
4.0,"FABULOUS for the price! I am all about monochrome lately and I really wanted a car coat for this late winter/early spring thing that's happening. This is definitely a light coat. Below 30F or so you'd be pretty cold in this. The construction is not GREAT, but I also paid less than $30! The weirdest thing about it is that it has fake pocket flaps and behind them...real, traditional pockets?<br /><br />I'm about a 14/16 in US sizes and I usually wear a 1X. This looked to me like one of those teeny tiny &#34;plus&#34; brands that are all over Amazon and I'm pretty broad shouldered, so I got the 2XL. The 1X would have been fine! I don't mind the loose fit of my coat at all, but if you're looking for a snugger fit I don't think you have to size up."
4.0,"I was able to wear these for quite a while with my legs folded, straight and even sitting cross-legged. They eventually did dig in a bit, but it took longer than average. I wish the toes were a bit thicker, but they will definitely do."
4.0,"It was really cute. I got the pink one for my new Medusa piercing. 1-it was a little tight, but that's on me. 2- you could barely notice the heart shape. And 3-The screw part of the piece is too short and it fell out while I was at work. :( I had it for a few days only, byebye money."
4.0,"A little small, even for child's head. Love it though, cute on my daughter."
4.0,"These pants fit as expected. The only reason for a 4 stars is the fabric is different that expected. It is a thicker fabric and will be fine for winter, but not for all year wear."
4.0,Cute earrings. .
4.0,"I do love this dress, I do. And I bought it a bit large because I knew that this style would probably be too small for my chest area, but the top area still was too short and just looks a bit frumpy."
4.0,"very fast shipping, very quite."
4.0,"I got the shoeslocker Girls Slippers for my three year old son.  I'm not sure why they are marketed as girls slippers as the gray color is not that feminine and my son loves them.  The animal face is absolutely adorable.  The slippers do run small and luckily I ordered a larger size as they fit my son perfectly.  The faux fur on the outside is incredibly soft, as is the inside.  The soles are sturdy and non-slip.  My son runs all over our hardwood floors like crazy and he has not slipped once.  I would have given five stars but as other reviewers mentioned, the ears are attached in an odd way.  I thought there was a plastic disk under the ears but it might be glue.  Whatever it is you cannot see from the outside of the slipper, but it is rough and hard right underneath the ears.  Besides that, these are the only slippers that my son will wear so that makes for a happy mama."
4.0,Good fit and serves the purpose
4.0,Love everything about it just wish it was more see through
4.0,Color was to light for me.<br />Leggings were just what they were said to be.
4.0,This plated wedding ring looks very nice on my finger. It's not too heavy nor too light and is just the right blend of simplicity and ornamentation.
4.0,"I love the bulldog! Because there was no description of the chain, also purchased a n additional anklet chain. Im so glad that I did. The chain that came with the bulldog was way to small, so I put the bull dog on the new chain. It's all better now! My sister is going to love it?"
4.0,"Large face, decent construction but I noticed a bit of moisture building on the inside of the watch."
4.0,"good material, but too large for the size, Also, the color is too dark not as described"
4.0,Love this.  Bc I’m a little small the shorts were a tag big but I pulled them up a bit and they fit like a glove.  I will be ordering other colors if possible
4.0,These were just as expected. I use them on handmade Christmas ornaments & the occasional graduation gift. Sure wish they came in a smaller package because the end of the year will come & I will have 60-70 left.
4.0,"I went by the size guide, it was too big. cute coat, light but wouldn't be warm enough for MN winters. I was sad to send it back, fast shipping otherwise. customer service was easy to work with."
4.0,"Fits great, and is very comfy. I ended up buying a second dress in black."
4.0,"This bag arrives scuffed up with a distressed look. It is hard to believe that a leather purse costs under $30 but this is real leather, I inhaled.<br /><br />The bag has two zipper pouches for storage on one side of the purse (outside). My wife really likes that. Inside of each zipper pouch is enough room to store a large cell phone, mask and keys. Anything you want to access easily. Inside, there is another deep zippered area, There are also two ""pouches"" for storage. Inside the bag itself, there is enough room for a wallet, short hairbrush, keys, phone, and credit cards. The crossbody strap is adjustable by moving the buckle.<br /><br />I knocked off one star because of the zipper closure of the bag. My wife doesn't like that when you zip up the bag, there is way too much zipper. When the bag is completely zippered shut, there are about 3 inches of excess zipper sticking up. Clearly, this is a design flaw. Not too attractive to look at, as it cheapens the bag."
4.0,The dress is very nice and the material is thick. I recommend buying a size smaller because it runs big.
4.0,Smaller than I had expected but very cute
4.0,clean look
4.0,"Who needs Merino wool? I got these because they are easy to wash and quick to dry, especially during travel. Had I known about him before, I would've bought pairs long ago. Just about every attribute, that we hear about Merino wool, can apply to these, at a much lower price"
4.0,"These seem like decent hiking boots, however beware of the sizing! I ordered size 11 and received size 46 European, which in the US translates to size 12, and in the UK to size 11. Not sure if these go by the UK sizes or if I received the wrong size. Unfortunately, my son with size 11 foot was unable to wear these. My husband is US size 12 and these shoes fit him perfect in length, however they are slightly narrower than what he usually wears and rub on the side of his foot if he wears too long. I would definitely be cautious if you have wider feet. Other than the sizing, the shoe itself is quite nice. The sole has a nice grip surface to it and will be great for hiking. The boots also come with comfortable inserts. The material seems sturdy but light at the same time and these boots are much lighter than my husband's other pair of hiking shoes. This should be more comfortable when walking or climbing through terrain."
4.0,Super cute! Be careful when packing bc it can get misshapen but just the same if you can fill it/fold it it will go back to normal shape. I got it wet and it didn’t ruin it at all. Definitely beach ready!
4.0,It helped my daughter from shivering in the  pool.
4.0,The fit is 1/2size smaller than I ordered. It's very comfortable. Its also lightly padded. I like the fact they are wireless.
4.0,Wonderful quality ! Great color ! Great team !
4.0,Fit somewhat small.It is a nice dress but for a short person.I am size 10 US  and this dress it;s tide and short Looks like a size 8 US.
4.0,This is a fun ring to wear when I am not wearing my real engagement ring. The ring is simple and elegant. The CZ almost looks real but has a lot of rainbow colors in it. The band is scraped a little and the side CZ's are not set as well as the center. Overall I am happy with this ring.
4.0,"Very well made. Kinda too well. Do not unscrew either side of eyeglasses because  the spring will retract and a special tool is required to extend the eyelet to accept the screw again. Love the glasses though, until a hinge was bent  and I thought I could fix it...they lasted a week."
4.0,Fits great but material seems cheap. I haven’t attempted washing it yet but would be careful.
4.0,Pretty! Although the color is lighter than on the photo.
4.0,"My daughter absolutely loves the animal designs, but there is a ridge along the seam that bothers her. There are also bumps/threads inside from the patterns. They’re good quality, but unfortunately not working for my sensitive child."
4.0,I like this purse a lot. It feels heavy-duty but it's not heavy like some other leather purses are. It is stiff but I'm sure the more I use it the leather will soften up. It's great to wear as a cross-body handbag so my possessions are secure and it has multiple pockets to keep my things organized. Looks like they put a pocket wherever they could fit one (see the back of the purse). I recommend it.
4.0,I love these sunglasses (bought the red pair first and just had to get the pink pair too) but the color is so light.  I really wish these had been a darker pink.
4.0,this is a very beautiful bracelet. i was going to give it to my niece but fell in love. its to big for kids. a nice piece of affordable jewelry for adults. i actually got 2 . after seeing it and knowing now way for her little wrist. i decided to keep it. went out side didnt bump it or anything and the stone fell out and was lost. well as you can figure its worthless without it. amazon was great and replaced it. but fair warning to anyone who buys this item . definetly worth price. beautiful. but when you receive it bump the stone . because the replacement one fell out immedietly in my hands and i barely touched it. so use a little supper glue. and in 15 seconds you have a solid hold and no one will know. thank you amazon
4.0,"Runs super small ordered an XL for my man and it looks like a small .  My man is normally a XL . Also the quality of the shirt is not that great ,it’s thin and will definitely fade and the sticker will wear out after a few washes ."
4.0,The quality is decent for the price. However this suit runs super small and is possibly for those without curves. I am 5’2” 34dd 123 lbs. I wear a 4-6 in dresses and swim. I ordered medium and while I got suit on I looked like a stuffed sausage. I am returning for a large which hopefully fits.
4.0,"Way, way, way too small. You will have to order 2 or maybe even 3 sizes up. Apart from that: Nice cut, good quality."
4.0,Very pleased with this bag. I purchased it to use for work. My only complaint would be that I wish it was just a little larger. Otherwise very excited to use it
4.0,good belt if you don't want leather
4.0,"Pants fit great.  I knew to buy one size up from my regular (I'm a size 4 for regular pants, I buy size 6 for anything with a tighter fit).  Fun to wear.  Trimming look.  I washed them before wearing, and at 5'3&#34; the regular length did not require hemming (when wearing a 2-2.5&#34; heel.  I'll be ordering more colors."
4.0,Great locket.Nice size. Instructions on how to place a picture would be great as we are having some difficulty! Great product though would buy again.
4.0,"I wear this watch everyday. It has held up for two years with only slight discoloration. It looks good with any outfit. If you want an inexpensive everyday watch that keeps good time, it will be worth your money to buy this one."
4.0,As designed
4.0,It's nice but the arms are too tight and it would be uncomfortable so will return.
4.0,nothing special but OK
4.0,"It's a pretty dress - just like the picture. I like it, the quality is good and fit nicely."
4.0,"As my first try with compression socks I thought they worked fine until I realized they were slowly sliding down my calves. Comfy, but probably not doing the job the way intended."
4.0,"it lasts long, feels hard though and if your not careful can poke your eyes out so pointy at the end."
4.0,"I got my hat crushed in the bag and has creases i cannot get out. The crease is barely noticeable, I was going to return it but decided to keep it and suggest to the seller to ship in a box. Its a very nice hat."
4.0,"We got these for our niece, she went crazy when she saw them. They do look pretty cool. However, I did think the earrings would be a little brighter, but they look awesome so really no complaints here."
4.0,quick dry and flexes so the fit is tight and comfortable. I would give it 5 stars only if it had an iside pocket for a key like most speedos do.
4.0,"Would give this 5 stars, but the band around the pigs belly is turning green."
4.0,great fabric for the price
4.0,"Very comfortable and breathe well. I like the high waist. A tad long, but I'm 5'2&#34;. Hidden pocket is cool, although haven't needed to use it. The material is kind of see through around the inner thigh/crotch/buttocks area. Not great for downward dog type positions. That's too bad because otherwise I like them very much."
4.0,This is a good product but expect to order at least a half size smaller.
4.0,Great sunglasses for the price! Was looking for some polarized glasses for driving but didn't want to pay a ton since I have a habit of losing glasses.. these were perfect and the coloring on the lenses is fun for summer!
4.0,"I love these earrings, they are so bright and sparkly."
4.0,Sleeves are kinda long
4.0,"This dress is okay, nothing to really write home about. It does fit well, but I'm not sure it flatters as well as some other reviewers state. I bought it to wear at my cousins wedding next month and I'm sure it will be just fine."
4.0,I think it runs a little small but I do like it and the material is very nice.
4.0,"He estado coleccionando relojes desde hace algún tiempo y han sido increíbles tanto en imagen como en calidad. Siempre he apreciado los diseños simples de estos relojes de vestir, pero lo más importante, estoy muy satisfecho con la durabilidad de cada uno que he tenido. De todos los relojes que compré en , solo uno de ellos ha tenido un problema menor."
4.0,It is very dainty the day is almost invisible.<br />It’s a gift for my niece and I think she will like it
4.0,"I ordered these as a Christmas gift for my 8 yr old daughter, she loves them! They light up in several different colors and come with a charger. I ordered them a half size larger to ensure that they fit just in case they ran smaller, it was the right thing to do because they did."
4.0,Not as spacious inside as you'd expect but it's still lovely and I get lots of compliments for it
4.0,little big and the design is odd.  the strat is actually left handed on the hat looking like a photo negative.
4.0,They are cute but still tend to slip. They also show with all of my flats but the lacy detail adds not really detracting from the look.
4.0,"They are high wasted when you put them on, but noticed they slide down soon (depending on how active you are) and that gets irritating constantly stopping what I am doing to do ballet to pull them back up lol.<br />They are butter soft and wish they had pockets on outside. I am happy all in all, just some minor issues"
4.0,The cloak was just fine and to an affordable price! Works out very well!
4.0,They were two long on bothe girls
4.0,It’s a nice bag. Easy to carry but overpriced and shoulder handles is cheap looking and feel. It is perfect size for me and easy to carry
4.0,These are cute and work like they should but I thought the leg holes were tighter than the other iplay bottoms we have purchased
4.0,"I love the color combination that I chose, red/purple. The top fits gorgeously, but I can see an issue for women with breasts larger than a B cup. I’m fairly small on the top so it was perfect. However, it looked more like a beach my type look and skirt was pretty see through. If it was lined I would have kept it and probably been more comfortable with wearing it out. Anyway I returned it, but just bc of preference."
4.0,I love ❤️ these frames. The glitter was such a pleasant surprise! I can not wait to get these from the optical store so I can sport them!
4.0,Polarized lens was very clear and clean. Use them for golf and Pickleball. Highly recommend.
4.0,I love the look and feel of this shirt.
4.0,Comfortably and flowy. Stretchy fabric. I love these swing dresses. Great price.  Only reason I didn't give 5 stars is the solid grey is a little sheer.
4.0,"Aside from the size it is quite good, light but sturdy & comfy. It does not come in different widths"
4.0,"The sleeves are too tight.  I usually wear a 1X but because of the fullness of the dress, I ordered a large.  I have large arms and I wear a 44DDD bra.  An x-large would have been a better fit.  Material is not knit but it is heavy...maybe jersey."
4.0,Not doubled sided
4.0,It was perfect to take to the game. Exactly what I needed.
4.0,Super cute I bought for my daughter she loves them.
4.0,This belt is far nicer than would be expected judging from the price.  It is great in every aspect except sometimes the the buckle catches on something and the belt loosens :(
4.0,"They're identical to the one my daughter got with her paint set, which has lasted 2 years."
4.0,I really like this simplistic design to the band. One star removed because it took a little while for this &#34;poke&#34; to go away. It felt like a thread but when examining the band no thread in spot. After some a full week of wearing it the leather is now soft enough and no problems. I would caution to switch this band/rotate as it seems like it will deteriorate a little faster.
4.0,"Given for a Christmas gift, its Too big and I can't return it  :("
4.0,The material is light weight and comfortable. The slits on the sides were higher than expected though.
4.0,"Should be longer for a large, I am 5&#34;7, quality good"
4.0,Cute and stylish but it runs a little large but no complaints here I tie it as shown by model.
4.0,Christmas present for my daughter. Material and buttons were nice and fit as expected.
4.0,Not really a sweatshirt but a t-shirt weight material which is fine if that is what you are looking for.  Runs big.
4.0,"I'm 5'4"" 160lbs and wear a 34D. I ordered a large because that's what I usually wear in swim tops and it was slightly too big around. The cups were fine. The bottoms are very comfortable. Color and look are as pictured."
4.0,"I ordered these based on the reviews. I was looking for really warm socks- those thick comfy socks- mostly for ""house lounging"" this winter since the pandemic situation looks as if it will keep me sequestered more than normal. When these arrived I was disappointed at how they didn't look much thicker than my normal Plain old socks. However once I put them on on a chilly morning, they are much warmer and cozier than they look- so material and thread count per inch (tighter weave) really makes up for the thinner body which also means a little less bulk and other issues from thick socks. These are Good socks."
4.0,It's a handkerchief...what can I say
4.0,"I bought this for my 10 yr old daughter. Who's 5' tall. length was great. just about an inch and half past her knees. Color says ivory, but when received it, its white. That's ok though since that'd the color i wanted. I was just taking a chance on the color. fabric was nice and flowy but not see through."
4.0,"Waterproof and foldable. This hat fits a bit large for my taste. I forgot that. I was replacing one I bought in person that my dog would review as ""chewy, durable, and hours of entertainment."" I had forgotten that even with a regular sized dome like mine I needed to buy a hat one size smaller or risk it blowing away. For the record, I spent 3 days sea-kayaking with the first hat. I also loved it for jogging as it's light weight. Plus, I could fold it up and put it in my pocket when I didn't need it.<br /><br />This second hat is the same. Just a bit larger. Very good hat for the price."
4.0,The earmuffs are for my 3-year-old. I tried them on and they fit snug and at first I thought they would be to tight but he really liked them. We went to Monster Jam and he left them on the entire time. He was not bothered by the noise at all. I also bought a pair for my 10-year-old and he loved them too! He said they really helped with the noise at Monster Jam and they were comfortable.
4.0,"This is amazing, fits my iPhone 8 Plus WITH a pop socket! The only downside is that it doesn’t fit an unfolded dollar bill. (Because the case is the same size as a phone it’s not quite long enough for bills— you have to fold in one end about half an inch.put your iPhone on top of a dollar bill and you’ll see what I mean.) Not a huge deal for me since I don’t *typically* carry enough cash to take up a lot of wallet space. Super cute and extremely functional!"
4.0,I really like the material it fits perfectly and it's not see through. Well the white on is  so I would wear dark under garments. But the black isn't. I only gave it 4 stars because it took a month before I receive my order and I am a prime member.
4.0,Hard to open plug in cap but overall great case
4.0,"Very pretty, but its like the size of a small throw blanket it. Maybe my fault, I didn't expect it to be that big. It looks like I have a blanket wrapped around my neck too."
4.0,"My nephews loved this, good size and quality"
4.0,I have no complaiants about the necklace. It is as it appeared on line. It is for my granddaughter and I think she will really like it.
4.0,Needs to be taken in for my son
4.0,"I returned. Ordered wrong version that was smaller.<br />Was lovely, well made & organized."
4.0,"Most of the chokers have lasted a while. However, the plastic one broke as soon as I tried to put it on. I wasn't too upset because I cared about the fabric ones more."
4.0,My mom and I have really large heads. Most hats are too small for our larger than normal heads. The large size of this hat is the perfect size. It’s also very nice looking. The downside about this hat is that it doesn’t completely block the sun out bc it has holes.
4.0,Looks good and fits nice
4.0,"I just tried it on, and haven't yet really worn it.  I bought it to wear under my nightgown when I go to my daughters home. It really is very pretty."
4.0,it is exactly as pictured and fulfilled my wishes
4.0,"I love the room in it and all the pockets, it was what I was looking for. It almost has too much room for what I have to put in it, almost!"
4.0,"I bought these to dig in my garden , I was digging up potatoes and my regular gloves just get muddy but don't really get down into the dirt.  These gloves dig down into the dirt to the potatoes..  They are a little big for my fingers  but work really well for the job. I think what I would like would be for some way that they were attached  between the fingers so that all fingerrs are digging at the same time.  I guess if I curve my fingers a little they will work the way I want.  This was a great buy and I think they will lasst a long time."
4.0,Everything as described... Husband liked the wallet time will tell how it wears.....shipping time good...
4.0,"Needed these socks for snorkeling because my current fins would cause blisters. They worked well. They were a little small, but did the job."
4.0,"I love these jeggings! Too bad they do not wash well and become pillared after the first wash. I also bought a size small when I first found out that I was pregnant, and 9 months later, they still fit!"
4.0,"These earrings are so beautiful, I just love them even though they are not well made."
4.0,"Product description says ""super soft and stretchy material.""  Instead I would describe it as a rougher Tshirt material - one that isn't that soft nor stretchy.  Says to line dry which I am not sure why - tag states it's a mix of polyester, spandex and bamboo fiber, which shouldn't shrink(?).  Other than that, I do like the green color and the cut is nice.  TTS."
4.0,They are lovely and most arrived in great condition. 2 were bent and have creases in them.
4.0,"Stylish, great looks, lightweight.  Fit nicely over my glasses."
4.0,Beautiful timepiece
4.0,Not the colors indicated
4.0,It was good but some of the string attached to the skull fell out.
4.0,Beautiful shoes....NOT U.S. sizing.....ran short  on me....had to return.....regrettably
4.0,"Love these pj and super bright and soft, I would recommend sizing up though, run snug"
4.0,"Cute and not heavy at all, love them!"
4.0,This is a nice light pullover hoodie. It's excellent for raking leaves in the yard. It's not very heavy due to not having any lining on the inside.
4.0,"Product is great, bar is a little long and tends to flip the wrong way instead of leaving against my war and not moving, over all I'm pretty happy with my product though."
4.0,This was just perfect for the special event I ordered it for.
4.0,Really similar to just a big and somewhat clear rubber band but it will keep your shoes from falling off and make them more secure so it gets the job done. Also not very transparent.
4.0,Other than it's real tough to breath in... it's a pretty sweet mask.  I had to cut an air hole to survive.
4.0,I used this cosplay for a con. The shirt is really good! Not excellent material but it’s the best out of the package. The hat isn’t bad for what it’s worth. But you can tell it’s cheaply made. The gloves were the worst. The fingertips were frayed and unevenly cut. I had to fix it myself. Overall though the cosplay IS what it’s worth. At least the hat and the shirt is good. I would recommend getting different gloves. Also the sizes run a bit small.
4.0,"The bracelet is very nice; however, my husband prefers heavy bracelet."
4.0,It's a pretty nice piece.  I really like the design.  It does seem a bit shorter than my other barbells but if does fit.  I was worried about my hair getting caught on it but that hasn't been a problem.
4.0,Love the bright colors and fits fine.
4.0,"Creí que eran grandes por que en la foto se le veían grandes a la modelo adulta, y llegaron pequeñas como para niños, eso fue lo único que no me gusto. Lo demás parece que todo bien."
4.0,It arrived on time in a battered package. It was unharmed and gorgeous. It will go well with all outfits.
4.0,"it,s beautiful."
4.0,The sizes of both ran at least a size smaller. Luckily I have 2 granddaughters that could trade down with each other. They love the feel of the fabric.
4.0,"it seemed a little tight, looks narrower than my old Shimano shoes, it was nice that it came w/ SPD cleats installed."
4.0,These are actually really cute
4.0,Very cute. The back doesn’t lay quite as shown on the picture but it is still cute. I bought for a 10 year old
4.0,The picture was a lot brighter then actual stone.  Wife still liked it
4.0,Shirt is big and shorts are small.
4.0,"The fit was fine but the dress is really long. I’m 5’7 and I could hem it by 1.5 inches and it would still be long enough to reach the floor. I ordered a Medium.  I wear it with flats or sandals but with the extra length, you would easily wear it with a wedge.  Dress is a polyester material"
4.0,"They are great for the price, However they were more shallow & a little less sturdy than I am used to using. Quick shipment, No issues. Great transaction."
4.0,"I love comfortable easy glamour with dramatic flair, and this delivers! I’m 5’8” 160 lb  athletic build 36” bust 30-31 in. waist and got an xl because other reviewers said it ran small. Large would’ve fit fine (normally wear medium, but order up when ordering from these amazon vendors). But I don’t mind the extra space. Still looks darned good. Striking!"
4.0,"I am currently obsessed with Leveret pajamas. I ordered the &#34;garbage truck&#34; and &#34;fire truck&#34; pj's for my daughter and loved them. Great quality. The whales are cute too but they are a more standard design. Overall, although pricey for pajamas, i would definitely buy this brand again."
4.0,They - are - just - fun.<br />Do they all work?  No.  About a 10 to 15 % failure rate.  The switch is cheap plastic for goodness sake.<br />Are they cheaply made?  Yes.  I mean think about it.  You get 40 lights (with batteries) for $7!<br />The light packs some punch and I attach them to my bike for riding my bike around town at night. The kids love them and use them for all sorts of things.<br />Would I buy them again?  You betcha.  In fact - I did.
4.0,Jacket is a little bigger than I expected but it works. It’s extremely light but very warm.. it does shed some feathers. Overall I’m happy with the purchase.
4.0,I love the fit of this dress. It is really cute wi sandals. It even lasts till fall with boots. .
4.0,These glasses are EXTREMELY lightweight! Having said that are surprisingly durable for how light they feel. This is personally good for me because of my sensitive temples and the lighter the glasses the better.
4.0,Bought for my cousins graduation.<br />She loved it.<br />Very dainty/girlie.
4.0,"I wear a medium, bought a 2X.  It just fits and is short, would have loved for it to be large enough to hang like it does in the picture."
4.0,Bought two pairs. Feel and fit well. One pair seems to already be coming apart.
4.0,"This was a really good bodysuit, easy to put on and comfortable but unfortunately, it didn't meet my needs.  I needed something to really hold my lower abs in but with this, I felt like the control part of it was concentrated in the mid section which I don't need as much.  After 3 c-section my lower abs are hanging and this made me look like I had a cameltoe LOL."
4.0,Good quality. Didn't expect them to be so long. I'm 5'10&#34; and they reached my ankles.
4.0,Nice fit and looks like picture
4.0,"Fits decently well and stays on. Blocks the sun decently, but not something that I would probably use heavily myself as I have my own pair of prescription sunglasses. But if you're looking for something relatively inexpensive that gets the job done, these should work."
4.0,"Beautiful blouse in soft, flowing fabric. Originally bought the medium (I usually wear a US 8 10) and it looked great, but the pleats across the bust were too tight and made the buttons pull. I returned it and got the next size up. This one fits loose and is almost baggy, but it is so comfy I'll keep it! Shipping was fast as was the refund for the first purchase."
4.0,It was a good product and durable.
4.0,"My 6 year old looked super cute in this. The only issue were the pants being too short and too wide making them look baggy. She is a petite little girl, so we don't usually have issues with length. The waist was just right, and the top was perfect."
4.0,"I bought 3 different styles and colors, all in Medium but they run a bit big so could've purchased a SMall.<br />They are so pretty and comfortable that now I'm back to purchase a couple more!<br />I hope the quality is good- still need to see that after some washes!"
4.0,"Based on another review, I ordered an XL.  I'm 5'4"", weight 145 lbs. & 34B bra size and the XL was too big.  Large would have fit perfectly (unfortunately, they are sold out or L).<br /><br />Also note: As with most patterned clothing, there is a chance that the pattern can land at an unfortunate place.  The swim suite they sent my had an unfortunate pattern placement on the bottoms.  If it would have fit, I would have exchanged it for another."
4.0,Nice well made fits good
4.0,I decided to try these socks out because I have sore feet and legs. They arrived very quickly with no damage so a big thank you to the seller for quick shipping of my new HealthyNees  Compression  Socks. The socks are very tight fitting which I found at the end of the day my legs and feet have not been as sore.  They are thin and very comfortable. I will probably get some compression socks in a low cut sock for summer weather. I did receive this product at a discounted price for my unbiased and honest review of the HealthyNees Compression Socks
4.0,Heavyweight but gorgeous
4.0,I am very satisfied with these shoes.
4.0,"Love these slippers!  The sole could be less hard, but other than that, great!  I don't wear them for long periods of time."
4.0,The skirt is boxy and runs big. I ordered L but a small would have worked.
4.0,For 20 bucks these shoes are amazing.
4.0,Comfortable during indoor activities
4.0,Good product. Maybe a little too expencive. One week into wearing them one came apart in the middle and had to be tied. TRUMP 2016
4.0,"I like for the price and a pleasant surprise with long strap on inside of bag. I prefer the long strap ,so I can wear it cross-body style.<br />I like that is is light weight yet strong for the sale price of $9.98 , it will work for my needs."
4.0,I used it for the helix piercing. It is Fragile so you need to not put too much pressure on it. since i only have one helix piercing i was playing with the other one and it sore of broke. Be gentle. overall i am satisfied.
4.0,"This product came with a small fiber sheild that needed to be placed in the center of the masks.  The pocket for the sheld had opening on both sides and the sheid came out of place easy.  The material is not too thick.  This item fitted nicely and the design print was lovely. The price was great, too.  The package arrived a day earlier than schedule.  It's fine to purchase this product."
4.0,"I ordered navy blue in xl, and I love the way dress fit, and it was really cute but the only problem I had was that it was not as navy blue in the picture, it’s more of a bright blue. My dress is on the right in the photo."
4.0,The description states with a bow but the type of bow was not what I thought it would be. It's the ribbon bow.  Other than that it was as discribed.
4.0,"She has discovered she likes wolves at 13 and she loved the necklace! Happy granddaughter, Happy Nanna! Win Win"
4.0,Nice shirt! Smaller than I expected but nice material!!!
4.0,"Well made, comfortable and warm. Slightly large for me at 5' 4&#34; 140lbs. I'll probably just trying shrink it down. These look better than the Hanes but the small doesn't fit as well."
4.0,She loved them but 10 was too small. So her little sister got them because the size 8 I ordered for her never arrived.
4.0,"This was exactly what it looked like. But the same day I put it on my key chain, the top of the shoe fell off. This shouldn't happen the first day you get it. Not happy, because it's lost.<br />So if you don't plan on using it, it looks pretty, but never take it out of the package.<br />They messaged me and replaced it immediately. Great and friendly customer service."
4.0,Good for the price though i don't think it is polarized
4.0,"The light works great. I use this for running in the dark and it helps show the path, however the belt would be better if it was a stretchy belt similar to the spi-belt. This belt allows the light to bounce around where I don't think an elastic belt would do that."
4.0,Love this watch as far as looks ... it was as huge though I had to have 4 links taken out ! It is very hard to program also. For the money spent I like it and would buy it again.
4.0,"Cheap costume earring, but looks just like picture! I got some ton of compliments when I wore them."
4.0,It looks very pretty.
4.0,Good for the price and includes a lining. But the size small was a bit large overall and the binding around the neck and armholes is a little stretched out.
4.0,"Great  fit ,got  them for my wife, she is now a  happy  camper."
4.0,"Good, comfy attractive PJ's. I just wish tall people could have pajama bottoms that cover the ankles. It doesn't seem too much to ask."
4.0,"The mask itself is beautiful and exactly what I expected.  It is a little rough around the edges of the eye so I will have to put some moleskin/felt on the inside before the big party. My order came within a week and it was packaged properly so there was no damage.  Overall, very satisfied!"
4.0,"Very comfy! Wore every night for a week when I got them. Only thing I don't like is the very low waist. Aren't we past the ultra low waist in fashion now??? These arent *too* terrible but they should be higher. They are jammies, after all."
4.0,"I'm 5'4&#34; and 130 pounds and ordered a US size large. I am very happy I did. This top may look like a dolman style on the model, but on me it isn't. Rolling the sleeves up past the middle of my forearm is not possible for me. The top is higher in the front than the back, but still is long enough for me in the front. It has a pleat on the back making it loose fitting, which I love. Also, the plaid on the sleeves is the same look on the back of the shirt, which was a nice surprise. However, the price is great and it arrived earlier than expected. It shipped November 17, and arrived November 27. Overall a great shirt!"
4.0,"Like: Nice colors, lightweight, not bulky.<br />Dislike: Thinner than expected, but will be warm."
4.0,"Bought these for my daughter. Fit her perfectly but leg length is shorter than expected (not as long as picture shows). Overall, she's happy with them."
4.0,"From the front, I loved this dress , but from the side and back, there was odd pleating on the butt that I couldn’t get to lie down"
4.0,Arrived on time and are very pretty.
4.0,"This outfit was adorable! My only complaint was that it was a little itchy for my child at the seams, I flipped it out a bit and it was fine. Great fit and so cute!"
4.0,"My only complaint is the built in light. It only partially illuminates the time, like only the hour. Practically useless."
4.0,"Seem a little small, but fit ok."
4.0,I really like this top it’s that polyester stretchy type unlike most of the tooniforms I got it a size bigger thinking it would be the normal<br />Cotton.  It’s a nice top gets snagged sometimes by cats and dogs but I<br />Enjoy it!
4.0,"It's very tight in the chest area. Arms are good snug but good, length is great. I should have sized up. The fabric feels OK. I haven't had a lot of time with it."
4.0,"My husbands belt literally falling apart. He always refuses to replace his things until they are absolutely no longer useable...so I had to take matters into my own hands and pick out a belt for him because he just wont shop for himself. I chose this belt because it appeared to be high quality and it was reversible. His old belt was a brown/black reversible so I thought he would like this one.<br /><br />When he opened it up the first thing he asked is, &#34;What is this tool thing for??&#34; I have no idea. He has no idea. I am assuming it is to switch the belt between black and brown, bringing me to my next point: It is not your typical swivel reversible belt. It looks like you have to literally take the belt apart to switch between black or brown. Very strange...my husband rarely uses the brown side but it still seems inconvenient...<br /><br />However, he noted that the quality was great. It's a nice thick, sturdy feeling belt...unlike his old flimsy $11 walmart belt. He is very happy with his new belt! :)"
4.0,"Fits like it said they would. Nothing special, not bad at all."
4.0,Earrings has great size and design. Posts were at a different location than I thought. Thought they were in center.
4.0,"This nightgown is so pretty!  I was hoping it would fit like a size 8 as marked.  I would say it is closer to a six.  Not as roomy as I would have liked for my grandchild who is a true size six in under shirts and pants. So if you do intend to buy this, take into consideration that it runs a size smaller than advertised.  It is gorgeous though."
4.0,"This dress is very flattering. It's actually a knock-off version of a dress I already bought from chicsoul.com. However, it was 1/2 the price so I got it in a different color. I have a larger chest and the buttons are slightly strained. I will wear a cami underneath just in case. It is very flowy, so you don't have to wear spanx. The material is not great, but not horrible either. I am definitely a fan."
4.0,"I really like this robe! I am of average build, 5'10, so I ordered the XL. I likely could have fit in the Large but I am ok with this. It falls at mid-calf in length- my only complaint is that the sleeves could have been about 4&#34; longer, but I do have long arms. This robe is soft and cozy without being overly thick, which is what I wanted. I had a really thick robe once and found it difficult to move around in. Overall, a very nice robe for the $$!"
4.0,muy comodo al caminar y ajusta bien!
4.0,So everything fits as it should EXCEPT the sleeves in true legendary whitetails fashion the sleeves ALWAYS seem to run short.  I wish they'd fix this for us normal proportioned folks
4.0,"These are not bad for the cost. Lightweight, easy to breath. Seem to be fairly well made. Bought these for hunting, should work out fine."
4.0,"Very flattering, fits well. 5'6&#34; 160lbs and ordered a large. It's short, but with some tights would be comfortable if you're worried."
4.0,It's super low cut and the material is a little think but overall it is nice
4.0,"It’s really cute. I love the color of the stripes and there’s some cute gold details on the handle. The only thing I didn’t like was that on the first day I used it, it turned inside out after a huge gust of wind. 😕"
4.0,This seemed to run a little smalled than we anticipated but my two year old nephew  loves it
4.0,Perfect For Beach and Swim Fun!Nice Colour Combination!
4.0,"Great fit until you wash it, then it shrinks. Too bad, it's awfully cute"
4.0,"As a truck driver, these are the only gloves I wear. They're great for protecting your hands and don't reduce your dexterity like the cheap cowhide gloves do. They are always comfortable, even when they get wet from the rain. I toss them on the dash and they don't take long to dry. I've never worked on a car while wearing them, but I see why mechanics like them."
4.0,Like the dress a lot it just runs a little small so make sure to size up.
4.0,"Very pretty, but it came with a strong odor that was hard to get out."
4.0,Really love the bracelets. Got them for me and my husband. The one I was wearing started to unravel after a couple weeks. I really wish they were made better.
4.0,"Bought a size 4t for my 3yr old and even though it's a size up, it's still a little too snug but the fabric quality is nice and doesn't feel cheap. The colors of the fabric are just like the pictures shown. The clasps on the suspenders are also very sturdy and it was helpful for my little one who liked to run and play because they didn't come loose."
4.0,"Put this band on my versa 3. I like the way it looks and the ease of use, but the edges of the band catch on my clothes and leaves snags. It doesn't bother jeans or similar fabrics, but my sweaters, yoga pants, slinky knits etc..."
4.0,"Super cute! Now, only if my daughter would wear them for longer than a few minutes....."
4.0,"It's not very warm, but it's super cute"
4.0,This tutu is just as described. very see thru.
4.0,I really do like the style and the color of this top. It is very lightweight more like a tee shirt. Be forewarned: I did listen to the other reviewers and sized up by one size. Very comfortable and the length covers your backside !
4.0,I was finally able to wear this coat the other day. It was nice and comfortable and kept me warm and dry. It did take me some time to fix the sleeves the way I like them. I liked the color and the fit.
4.0,Returning and ordering a size larger.
4.0,"This wallet is almost exactly right.  It has numerous pockets for cards, passport and travel documents.  The zippered change pouch is so flat that retrieving change is difficult.  The outer zippered sleeve is the right size for very small cell phones without a case.  Larger cell phones or phones in a protective case will not fit."
4.0,"I'm a solid medium on Amazon. My measurements are 36B, 29"" waist, 39 hips  and I bought a medium. I'm 5'8"", 155lbs. Not too short for a vacation dress. It reaches right above my knees. (I'm kneeling in the photo) Waist size is perfect.<br />I like the dress color so when it went on sale for $12 I got it. It really almost fit perfectly except in the armpits... so I just sewed it tighter in the armpit area. Not lined but not really see through (I'm wearing a black bra in the photos)."
4.0,I like this sunglasses because  they come with Hard protection case . And a cleaning cloth  They are perfect sunglasses for driving fishing and outdoor activities .  I also like the fact that  they come in different variety of colors . They are a great sunglasses for the price  I highly recommend  them
4.0,Nice shirt/ good embroidery/would prefer polyester than cotton
4.0,Helps my husband not loose his readers while are work
4.0,"Beautiful and seems to be great quality! Runs somewhat small. However, I look forward to wearing it! Love the colors!"
4.0,"Took a looooong time to get here (about a month) but that wasn't at the fault of the seller, just slow postal service. Dress is adorable, I got the blue one with stars and the design is intact and so cute!"
4.0,These were for my 5mo old and they're super cute but fit her head a little smaller than I would like.
4.0,It serves the purpose
4.0,It was nice I have sensitive ears and I didn’t have any issues with the metal but it is a little bit hard to open and close other than that I had no issues I used it for my tragus piercing it was a good size
4.0,"Love this jacket! My only complaint would be that the front pockets do not open under the flaps, you access the pockets from the side. Also,  I have long arms so for me I would like the sleeves a bit longer but for most people I'm sure its perfect"
4.0,"nice , good for Pokemon fans"
4.0,"Very cute and nice quality for the price, but was a bit small:("
4.0,"this Mae Women's Sleep Mask with cute Cucumber detailing is very comfortable on- very satiny and smooth across the eyes, puffy and lightly padded, and the elastic strap is even covered in a satiny fabric, so no tangles in your hair.  The only criticism I have of this mask, and that makes it maybe a 3 star for me if I take away all the other great attributes, is that I am very sensitive to light, and this pink mask (even w the cuke rubbery decals), is just letting in too much light even w my eyes shut. I like to wear masks when I really need to sleep, and unfortunately, the pink light hue is just not blocking enough sun."
4.0,"Beautiful dress!  Fits great-my daughter is 5'8"", 185 pounds and the XL fit great.  The fabric is heavy and the sleeve lace is itchy but looks great on her."
4.0,returned it  ( I think (
4.0,Can't complain for the price:)
4.0,A little small around the hips. Needs strings on the inside to tie it together first since it is slippery material. Very nice other than that.
4.0,"Cute, and comfy! Great quality and holding up nicely!"
4.0,"Boxer briefs are new to me, but they are a nice compromise of boxers/briefs. The cloth and elastic waist band are comfortable. Overall, they are very nice. My only knock is that the leg portions could be a tad longer, because the way they are cut/made they can &#34;ride up&#34; to the crotch."
4.0,"Lovely pair of gloves, I may have got them a little too small but it's not a big deal and they still look great. I highly recommend these."
4.0,"I love the patterns they come in, very pretty. They are just as pretty in person. The ear loops aren't very stretchy but luckily are big enough and comfortable. The mask part is a little big/long for my face and a little scratchy when first putting on but it was comfortable to wear. I'm glad I bought them."
4.0,I really like how soft and lightweight these pants are. They are great for wearing around the house. The one weird thing is how crazy long they are. I still wear them all the time and love how comfortable they are.
4.0,My daughter LOVES her big foot socks!
4.0,"I'm loving this dress. The colors are vibrant. Sexy. The only flaw, well, slight flaw, are sleeves.... they're a little itchy."
4.0,Beautiful dress.  I added a ribbon belt with a little bling in the front just to dress it up a little more.  Overall beautiful!
4.0,"I love these pants, they fit great. The only thing I don't like is that they are the type that the black fleece on the inside gets loose and goes into places you don't want it to."
4.0,"I may have been able to size down, but these are sweatpants... I didn't want them to be tight! These are good and thick, nice pale yellow color, but the waist band is quite large. I tightened the string, so it works for me. They have washed and dried well."
4.0,"Very cute and versatile hat, it is open at both ends and this but is still a cute accessory."
4.0,These earrings are just what I've been looking for.
4.0,"Really comfortable outfit, although I couldn't tie the bow on the crop top, but I'm not sure it actually mattered. The overall pants made a weird camel thing happening but that's probably bc I need to loose some of that belly I got from having three kids. Outside of that this outfit is really nice and comfortable."
4.0,Bought this twice since the first one I gave away in Ukraine
4.0,"Really awesome gloves.  With wraps on, these gloves are a very tight fit the first couple of times you use them. I'm 5'6 165lbs and bought 14s.  I've used them in three 2-hour long training sessions so far and they've loosened up nice and now fit snug and perfect.  The only knock against them; and all gloves are like this so I'm not sure it's worth bringing up but, once the glove breaks in, the lining can bunch up between your fingers.  Not a huge problem, just a minor annoyance."
4.0,Exactly as pictured. ORDER UP A SIZE. My daughter only got to wears it once.
4.0,Classy gloves.  Gave them as a gift for my better half.  Would have given 5 stars but they didn't mention the sizes run small.<br />Returned the gloves and got the right size in  return.  Better half wears them regularly.<br />Will order another pair.
4.0,These work good for the most part. One of my bags broke after the first use.
4.0,"The cover is lovely, but the color is misrepresented in the photo.  I thought it was going to be a golden yellow color, however it is autumn orange instead.  I'm sure I will use it next fall, but can not use it all year round."
4.0,"The dress, gloves and horns has good material but when i tried to wear the necklace, it broke... The necklace feels like cheap plastic."
4.0,Sizing is a little off. I ordered an 8 which would usually fit my index or middle finger but it’s small enough it only fits my ring finger. That’s cool with me cause I don’t mind wearing it there but beware it may come a little smaller than you wanted.
4.0,The dress it is beautiful but it runs large.
4.0,"she loves my black cat and this necklace is a good reminder,  I would like to see something like this in a little better  quality."
4.0,Good looking bandana. Husband aporoved. Great for covering your face while snowboarding too!
4.0,Super comfortable to wear.  My son is 20 months old.  He will only wear sweats like clothes.  I like it a lot.
4.0,I ware these hats on an almost daily basis. They are very stylish and comfy. The inside fabric though tends to make my hair a little tangled and staticy
4.0,"Beautiful sweater,"
4.0,"The dress is nice quality (especially for the price!) and I love the length. I'm 5'8&#34; and it falls just below my knees; it is hard to find dresses that modest these days! I wear 30&#34; waist and a 34C, ordered a M in navy and it fits as expected. I am not giving it a full 5 stars bc while I was in love with all the photos posted, I must say it's not quite as much of a &#34;wow&#34; for a girl with a flat butt :/ Ah well, it's still cute!"
4.0,"The earrings have beautiful design, but I had  some doubts if is it really silver. It is so light and the color seems “not silver”…I am also felt some itching in my ears."
4.0,"These pieces look great together for an evening of celebration paired with studs, pretty. I recommend this vendor."
4.0,Just like the title says but.. it really squeezes below the under arm as you see in the picture the bra is directly below her under arm and it hurt my under arm. it should be a little loose or shorter belowe the under arm.
4.0,These were great and served their purpose as “collar” for paw patrol birthday pup adoption but they came a little wonky. They weren’t perfect bands and they didn’t form to your wrist. Overall they worked.
4.0,"I was expecting short cardigans. I must have ordered the wrong ones, however I like them.  They were made for thin gals, I'm a short gal with a J.Lo behind, but they are great for lounging"
4.0,"Little big in the boob region, but other than that, perfect!"
4.0,"Mine runs ahead by about 15-20 seconds a day. Given it's not omega or rolex it may be within bounds. Besides this it looks very good, just like on the pictures. The metal strap is good quality and feels nice and solid. It's also easy to adjust provided one has the punch tool for it."
4.0,good quality for the slim man
4.0,"Ordered size M and fits small, this top it’s pretty but not as much it looks on the picture. I’m not going to keep it bc too small, for reference I’m 5.3 125lbs 34D cup."
4.0,"Overall, a well made shirt. Light weight, stitching satisfactory, good sized buttons and long enough to tuck in or leave out. Only thing I thought was not properly disclosed was the zipper pulls attached to the front pockets. Didn’t expect them at all and none of the manufacturers photos showed these as I recall. I tucked them inside the pockets so they don’t show. I am thinking of cutting them off actually. Size is true to form. Would purchase again."
4.0,"I like leather smell, but it's little smaller than I thought. I guess is less junk in my purse."
4.0,I wanted this specific outfit in 18 mos but they sent 9 mos so too small and not what was ordered on their site.
4.0,These tie clips were given to grooms man at my wedding. I would have liked if they were for skinny ties as they were a little thicker than i wanted but they overall looked nice in photos and made everyone look put together
4.0,Does exactly what it says it does. Purchase price has moved up $3 since purchasing.
4.0,"Runs small. I'm normally a small top and medium bottom, so I ordered a medium. Top fit but bottoms were a little tight. But for the price is great quality!"
4.0,"Awkward gluing wings on.  Several came off easily, but made a great party decoration!"
4.0,This dress is amazing when I first saw it on amazon I thought it was two pieces but it was actually one piece in my opinion I think the top is classic and elegant this dress is simple and classy for any occasion like confe
4.0,I really like the fabric. Bottoms fit perfect top runs a Lil small to be a medium. Overall satisfied
4.0,I bought this for my husband and he loves it! Works perfectly with his watch.
4.0,Shirts a little small. Wear it anyway. Have shorts to match.
4.0,My wife likes the concept of a skeleton (see through watch) but wanted something that still looked elegant.  This fit the bill perfectly.  The lower part of the face has skeleton window while the rest of the watch is conventional.  Keep in mind that this is a mechanical watch so you must either wind it or move it around for it to work and keep time.  I used an automatic watch winder and this kept time very well throughout the day.  Unfortunately it only lasts about a day if you remove it from you wrist so it does not have a significant reserve.  I keep this on the watch winder so it is always ready to wear.  Also worth noting is that the cheaper automatic watches don't keep time as well as quartz or other watch types.  This lost a couple of minutes in a few days despite being on the winder.  Overall this is decent for the price as a gift to anyone who may be a watch fan.
4.0,"Not bad for the price but they feel a little heavy, for lack of a better discription. I wear them under a loose pair of board shorts and I prefer a pair that fit a bit less bulky around the waist. Still not bad for the price though."
4.0,"I wear a 36b, and the lining of the dress went right at the middle of my boobs. It’s absolutely adorable, just wasn’t preferred placing."
4.0,"These are great shorts, comfortable, lightweight and loose fitting.  I am a shorter guy, so got the 7"" seam so they fit better to the knee.  That is all great and accomplishes everything I want. What I would like the manufacturer to know is that the first belt loop is too far from the button/front of shorts. When you use a belt, the tag end of the belt can reach the first loop, so it dangles / sticks out. It's not right and ONLY happens with these shorts. There is a error in manufacturing.  It even feels odd when looping the belt through, that you have to go unusually further to get the belt into the first loop.  I hope they fix and add colors and designs. It's a great short otherwise."
4.0,I love this dress just got the wrong size
4.0,Just received this as a Christmas present and it is perfect!
4.0,"Hope the clasp holds up, nice."
4.0,"Little guy loves Jelly. It's a poly blend top that runs a tad big. He doesn't care and wears it at least once a week. It has one snag, but it's not noticeable."
4.0,"So this is certainly value for money and they do the job well. I would warn that it isn't an even mixture of designs. For example, I have yet to come across one of the fleurs de lis, but I'm constantly coming up with suns. Not too many of the leaf shapes either, and they would likely be the most useful."
4.0,"Great price and very comfortable, will be very useful and is just what I expected.  I really like the top."
4.0,"Fits our 3 year old well, does not have a wire on the nose but still fits well.  Giving 4 star because the little ears stick out and get in her eyes so we have to tuck them in."
4.0,"I wouldn’t classify this shirt as denim- it’s more like a light canvas material. It is nice quality material and the color is also a plus because it doesn’t show stains easily. The downside is that it runs large, but that can be a plus for someone who is on the tall side. Overall, this shirt is more positive than negative so I would recommend it."
4.0,"I love this skirt. I bought it for work, I work at a fine dining restaurant. It is super comfy and fits perfectly. It's stretchy material, but nice looking."
4.0,My daughter loved the shirts and they are very soft. They run on the smaller slimmer side but that fits her frame. There was a black permanent marker mark on the back of one but I didn’t open it until the day before school so I couldn’t exchange it. :(
4.0,"fit as expected. only issue is one of the shoulders is already coming apart at the seam. It's an easy enough fix, but it shouldn't have to be fixed in the first place. Would have given 3 stars for the damage, but damage was minor and vest is very nice over all other than the torn shoulder seam."
4.0,The material is definitely thin yet comfortable to flex my legs.
4.0,"Awesome helmet altho in the amazon picture it looks like a straight edge beanie helmet but in reality it does have the side down curve to the back, when I tried to take a picture of that design feature I was unable to fully show that feature, so thats probably why you dont see it in the amazon picture either, but it does have a more streamline look and definitely alot lighter, and I love the quick release feature, I will wear it until I find a straight edge beanie"
4.0,"So far I've only worn this once but I loved it. It's not really a sweater, the material is very thin and relatively Walmart quality. Though it still looks nice to wear over a tank top in 70ish° weather. I ordered the 5x because I wanted something more loose fitting but it fits more like a 3x witch luckily is my regular size, so I'd recommend ordering a size up."
4.0,"Slightly small. Ordered Mediums, I’m usually a small/ medium and yet they are still tight. Also I would have liked a lower cut. But still love them."
4.0,"the hat doesn't look like the picture exactly - it's not shiny, but matte. collapsible  mechanism works great. ordered size large. my dad has a big head and it's too big for him."
4.0,beautiful and fairly easy to use.
4.0,"Nice stretchy shirt. Thin material, not a sweater but more of a blouse. Very cute, got lots of compliments."
4.0,"Everything about my new kilt extender straps looks good and was what I was expecting. The only reason I gave 4 out of 5 stars was I have not yet had the opportunity to actually use them... an important part of any evaluation. The first use of them was going to be for my bagpiping gigs for St. Patrick's celebrations, 2020. Unfortunately the COVID-19 situation completely cancelled all of them."
4.0,I bought this to wear in my daughter's newborn pictures.  It was perfect and comfortable
4.0,"A little small in the fit for my husband, but we kept it because it's really nice and I can wear it!"
4.0,Liked the outfit but the pants bagged out in the knees and the material does not retain its shape.
4.0,Good quality although it takes around 3 weeks for product to arrived.
4.0,"I’ll try to give this a fair review, considering it just doesn’t personally work for me. I like to wear modest, loose fitting clothing - so in my attempt to make this work, it was baggy on me. (Size L) I loved the pictures and had looked at this exact color so many times I finally ordered it to try it. But I will be returning it, as it wasn’t quite flattering, and not dressy enough for my brothers’ weddings. Due to the stretch fabric, I did not prefer the way the stitching in the seams stretched and made it seem not as sharp..."
4.0,Great purchase. You get exactly what you see in the picture
4.0,"The socks fit true to size, are very brightly colored and are very soft. They are not tight at the ankle but are a bit thicker than I expected. But they are very comfortable and breathable. I recommend them."
4.0,"Cute top. Elastic at the bottom of blouse,  witch I didn't realize when ordering"
4.0,The material was nice and well made.  I would buy other colors.
4.0,Its too stiff and boxy. Expected it to be smaller.
4.0,It’s a little tight but I’m sure it will stretch out
4.0,This hat was very soft and made very well. Very warm will be great in a New York winter. It fit perfectly on my husband's head except the area over his nose he said was a little bit too tight. Overall he really likes it and we'll use it for snow blowing.
4.0,"Got this as a gift for someone, and they said it was 'just right'"
4.0,got it as a gift for someone it is very nice looking and everything through amazon was great. the wrist band begins to fade/peel after a while and possibly water damage<br />however several weeks after buying it the person was in a car accident and send it to lucien piccard to have it repaired and that took a while almost 4 months although it was free because of the warranty you had to send $20 for shipping!
4.0,Second time wore it  and the tip of the belt buckle came off
4.0,"[[ASIN:B01BEAY0NC JJ Perfection Women's Asymmetrical Neckline Short Sleeve T-Shirt PURPLE 3XL]] This item does run small. I wear a 16-18. After reading some of the other reviews, I ordered the 3X and it does fit. I wish it was a tad longer, but I can still tuck it into my bottoms, so problem. The cotton is soft and has a bit of stretch.  The asymmetrical neckline is flattering. The shirt seems well constructed, though I do wish the tag had been sewn in with a darker thread. It came sealed in a clear plastic bag inside a tough plastic mailing envelope. It was wrinkled when I pulled it out, but a run through the laundry was all it needed. I received a discount on this item in exchange for my honest review. I am not affiliated with the seller."
4.0,"We got the short gold one. No instructions came with how to light up the dress. It came with 2 unopened batteries. We searched the dress high and low but could never find anywhere to install the batteries or turn it on. Also there was a little tear in the back of the dress where the bow attaches. The little pin that attaches the bow also came apart.  Now I know this sounds awful, but I returned the dress. A replacement came very quickly. It works and it’s gorgeous. There is a little plastic case that hangs in the body of the dress where you install the batteries and turn it on. I can’t wait to see my beautiful granddaughter in this! It’s for her birthday party."
4.0,Super cute and warm! Just as expected!!
4.0,A bit more transparent than I'd prefer but it's a very nice product.  I'm glad I bought it.
4.0,They fit pretty good. Good product and very reasonable price. I will keep buying this product.
4.0,"These socks are fairly thick, which makes them difficult, if not impossible to wear in shoes that fit well. They are made of all synthetic fibers, so your feet may feel a bit sweaty if you are able to wear them with shoes or boots. They are a bit rough feeling on the outside, but they are very soft and fuzzy on the inside, and seem to stay put better with the cuff turned down, in my opinion. Otherwise, they tend to slide down. This makes them wonderful to wear around the house. They're hard to fit when wearing good fitting shoes, but they would make a nice gift."
4.0,"My daughter had a pair of timberland's, they were expensive, but figured she'd wear them through the fall and winter and spring, but then I started to worry she'd scuff them and get them muddy and they'd wear out.  Got this stuff and sprayed them, let them dry and it was great!  They are a light grey color so I was worried this spray would darken them, but nope when they dried they were the same color.  The spray nozzle that comes on this is great!  Stuff has a strong smell to it, but again, once it dried the smell was unnoticeable.  I recommend this for any kids shoe you want to last through muddy puddles, sledding and leaf piles.  =)"
4.0,Helped with my foot pain. Will try them next tie I work 10 hours.
4.0,"Nice shoes, but the lining is from man made material, not leather, I with it was specified in product description."
4.0,Beautiful.  I loved it.  Had to order 2 sizes larger.
4.0,A very pretty watch. Took a long time to be delivered -about 3 weeks.<br />The multi dials are just for show. All that being said it's a fashion watch at a cheap price.
4.0,"They shrink! I followed other suggestions to wash and hang dry, even with doing this they shrunk! With that being said, the company has amazing customer service and they very quickly provided me with the next size up. So, my suggestion, size up. For example, my daughter is a true 3t, the 2t/3t shrunk and I had to get her the 4t/5t."
4.0,I like it but it's not as long as I had hoped.  Very limited to what you can do with it since you the length to be able to do more.
4.0,This runs a little small. Purchased for a trip to Spain - fit well in my suitcase. Functional.
4.0,Super cute well made high fashion dress.  However it does run small so please check the measurements. The only complain they use a cheap zipper so the tulle easily gets caught in there but it's was an easy fix.
4.0,"Super cute! The only reason why I didn’t give it 5 stars is because the color is not the same as the picture. But the quality is good, they came individually wrapped and in a box."
4.0,these are pretty nice...
4.0,This is such a pretty necklace with its crescent moon and star detail. I like the layered look of it and it looks nice with a blouse that shows it off. I am especially looking forward to showing it off during warmer weather and have enjoyed the very nice selection from this brand. The quality is decent for the price as well.
4.0,Stretches. Get size smaller
4.0,I got a xxl I’m 5’6” 260lbs. It’s a little see through so just wear nude underwear & bra. I love it
4.0,Seems to be a very well put together shirt. The silk is very soft and makes it a very light shirt to wear in very hot weather. The only real problem is that the shirt sleeve cuffs are very small. almost to small for a large shirt.
4.0,"I’m typically an xs/s but decided to go with a medium based on reviews. I find it a bit big, though the oversized feel is very comfy. I decided to return it, but only due to personal preferences. I wish it had pockets, and it doesn’t give me a shape since it’s big. I almost kept it though due to the softness!"
4.0,The quality of this shirt is great. I was disappointed it was too small in the stomach area. I'm 4'11&#34; and 136lbs I ordered a large. I'm afraid an xl would be too big.
4.0,"Real nice shirt, fits well and looks good."
4.0,"My niece really loves it.. she’s said quote “ it’s not to overly hello-kitty but just enough to show that she is a fan of hello-kitty...” it’s soft, Strechy just to her size and most importantly not itchy.."
4.0,"A little lighter than pictured, but good quality and fashionable."
4.0,"Good product, recommended"
4.0,I really liked these shorts but they do run a little small..
4.0,Definitely part of my everyday arsenal versus my charger cables and peripherals.  My only gripe is fastening large objects like wall chargers for extended periods of time stretches the elasticity of the bands.  The only real way to restore it is to not use those bands for a while.
4.0,my mom likes this so much
4.0,"Looks bigger in the picture, but I like the ring anyway!"
4.0,My dad’s coat now
4.0,My husband loves Tommy Johns but this particular style runs small. I would advise going up 1 size
4.0,Fish kept flipping over. I restrung the necklace. Good accent on casual outfits.
4.0,These shorts are perfect for my slender 10-year old daughter. She is looking forward to wearing them during summer camp.
4.0,"Living in a state known for constant sunshine, SPF protection has always been a concern and I almost always wear long sleeves when I expect to be exposed for any period of time.  This shirt arrived and was sent in a nice milky white plastic zip sealed package which gave it an air of quality right away. I removed the shirt and first let out a small groan. It seemed very shiny and unlike what I would normally wear. But slipping it on proved it didn't look too slick or artificial. I got my normal size, though this type of shirt very often runs small and can be binding. Not so with this one. In fact, it had generous dimensions without being too baggy at all. The fabric is very soft and sheer so should be very cool outdoors and I imagine will wick perspiration. Collar opening is sometimes too large and even in the marketing photo seemed like that might be an issue. While generous, it was about how I prefer. The description said it is not ""see through"" material and while that is true, it is very light weight and sheer. So much so that the outline of my nipples was clear and pronounced and even chest hair seemed to make it loft somewhat. I do like the shirt a lot and will give it a test daily wear outside this week. Jury is out in regard to its strangely revealing body features you might prefer be concealed. Other than that, comfortable, protective, fit as expected and even sleeve length is appropriate, as opposed to another similar shirt I received today whose sleeves were about 2 inches too short! Recommended, with those caveats."
4.0,MY GRANDDAUGHTER LOVED THEM.
4.0,"This nose hoop is perfect size, it looks awesome. I like the fact that it isn't a captive hoop, so you don't have the ball. The only problem that I have with it, is that it spins throughout the day. I have actually lost it at night before, because it just fell out. Luckily I found it. But I would definintely recommend this hoop."
4.0,"Garage door remote fo house and aut. Good itam for the money, kinda cheaply made."
4.0,love the blouse.  the blue is beautiful!
4.0,"It is very comfortable, and I am a very large girl. It is a bit big on the top half, even for me. The color will stain other fabrics you wear or sleep on for a while, even after many washes."
4.0,Loved the colors and fit my 7yr old daughter just right.
4.0,"I am a size 14-16 & I thought I would need an XL (by the size chart), but I actually should have ordered XXL. Very soft and the slit is very high for someone who is 5'8""."
4.0,I have bought L/XL socks and they did not fit. I could not even begin put them on.<br />I have 19 inch calf's and these fit.  They stay up OK.  I have to pull them up through out the day but they are<br />better than others I have bought.
4.0,"This dress fit me very well! I got a size large and it fit as expected. Yes, it is cheap and the material is kind of thin, but it still has quality and it works!"
4.0,"I followed the other reviews advice and bought a size up but it truly is a size too big. Forget the reviews, get your normal size."
4.0,"Lenses are flawless, they don't clamp onto your head, nothing is loose, they feel like they'll last.<br />The little nose pad things were bent out of shape, my guess is due to shipping. easy to bend back. Would reccomend for anyone looking for a harry potter or 60's-70's feel."
4.0,I like the bracelet symbolizing 30 years of marriage and the  quality of the bracelet along with the price is just beautiful. Thanks
4.0,"These are super cute. I'm in love with the black one.  The lighter one was a miss for me. Even though it's the same design, the text is so light and very difficult to read against the light fabric. If you're buying this solely for the white one, you might be disappointed."
4.0,"My grand daughter was delighted with her shortie pajamas.  I ordered a 6, which is generally her size, but they were slightly tight. I recommend the product, but you might go up a size."
4.0,It is ok for a day event. The headband is plastic. After a while it will bother you behind your ears.
4.0,Not the best quality but replaced quickly
4.0,"A little booby,so buy a shaw to cover iy"
4.0,"I ordered a larger size and it fit even larger than I expected, but no worries.  It's pretty and it is a great swimsuit cover-up."
4.0,"I bought this for tie-dye day at work, and thought it had a cute message. The fabric isn’t itchy and it breathes, which is a plus when you’re moving around all day. Overall very happy with this purchase!"
4.0,"My daughter loves the shirt and I think it's nice too, but it definitely is a bit small to be a tagged as a size medium.  She'll get plenty of wear out of it for a short timeframe though since it's her new favorite shirt."
4.0,"The keep my hands warm while typing and leave my finger frees. For someone that types without looking at the keyboard that is very important.<br />It felt a bit tight in the first times I used, but now feels more comfortable. Some of the finger holes are slightly frayed, I hope that doesn't get worse. My use is very light so hopefully it won't. Finally, the bones details are made of rubber, that might be relevant."
4.0,"I should have purchased the smaller size, the recommended size was too big for my little one,"
4.0,"Loved the charms! Came with all 30- good quality, and I do recommend! Comes with a cute box for all the charms!"
4.0,"The fit is true to size, hasn't rusted, all of the crystals are still in, comfortable, no green finger. I am super happy with this ring! :)"
4.0,Look great. Very comfortable and well built!
4.0,"I ordered the 9-10 (39-40) and all my toes hit the top. They run short, not so much narrow. Definitely size up! They are comfy though (if your toes aren't hitting the top)."
4.0,"This watch is not for everyone,very attractive though,tells time only when you want it to,I had to this fact,will buy it again though."
4.0,"Very warm, gets the job done in Michigan winter."
4.0,"Great socks, I'll get more."
4.0,not as comfortable as hoped
4.0,Clip is a lil big for the money but the leather and numerous pockets is a plus
4.0,"I like the mask, it's great. Did not come with filter for pocket in the mask."
4.0,"I was very excited to find something of Polynesian design, to reflect the region of the world where I was born in. The shirt design has prints on the front and back, which is something that I personally like and you don't find that much with any sort of shirt. I've gotten good compliments about it from people, I would say that the price is a bit higher than I'd like to have paid. But for a full frontal design and partial back design it's worth every penny.<br /><br />The only real problem is that the shirt itself is just a regular t-shirt, meaning that the design will eventually break and fade with printed on shirts. I've had t-shirts with designs embedded within the actual fabric but those cost at least double what this did. For circumstances and situations this will be more than good to show off Polynesian heritage or appreciation."
4.0,"These are beautiful earrings, strong, artsy, however, they a little too heavy for me.  Hard to wear too long or more than a few hours."
4.0,"Nice quality for outdoor event, very light and easy dry, however, i realized it is too big after wear it couple times. The waist is very loose for me. Otherwise, the quality is well made."
4.0,Love the suit a little large
4.0,"The ONLY thing I don't like about this dress is the pockets.  I know- who doesn't want pockets?  The reason I say this is I am hippy and don't need the extra bulge in the wrong spot.  The colors are vibrant, it is super comfortable and I hang to dry.  Just received my third one :)"
4.0,Fast shipping and great quality!!
4.0,"Got a lot of compliments! The underslip is a bit shorter than I like, but workable."
4.0,"Great shoes, just run a bit small"
4.0,"My daughter loves them. In the second week one of the metal fasteners came off after mild use, but was able to be reattached."
4.0,Nice and comfortable.<br />My son loves them.
4.0,"A great top to wear with leggings. Long enough to cover my butt (I'm 5'9&#34;) so it's work appropriate. Sleeves have plenty of length, too. Sometimes the sheer part gets a little bit of static depending on the material of my pants, but easily remedied with a dryer sheet or some water."
4.0,"🌸Review for Russell Athletic Men's Dri Power Full Zip Up Hoodie.<br /><br />Update January 1, 2021<br />Amazon - please bring back bright colors.<br />These are soft, mid weight, fits a little big.<br />When washed and dried it seems to bounce back in size but the color fades.<br />These are much better than I thought.<br />So far (4 plus) have been stolen.  (Yes, stolen)<br />And they are warm as expected....  This is a good purchase and that’s why I bought two more. (After mine were stolen)<br />I’m waiting patiently for the red!<br />I’m super glad they’re shipped and sold by Amazon<br />Thank you Amazon.com!<br />—-<br />I deleted the old review... I am sure that it was posted in the wrong place. That’s OK and I caught it. And really really....please bring back the red and green color.<br /><br />We all need a little more colorin our lives!<br />Thank you Amazon.com.🌸"
4.0,Very good quality and well worth the price. Awesome!
4.0,"good work belt, I'm using it right now"
4.0,"For the price and the quality this is a great product.  It was much much bigger than I thought and even the Small was much to big for me to use.  I am a  5'6&#34; female and weigh 135 lbs. This was not any fault of the company, I took a risk knowing that might be the case."
4.0,"Really like it! I also have one in charcoal and that fabric is thicker so I expected this one to be the same material. This one is silkier, feels nice against my skin but thinner. Both are quite long which is perfect for leggings."
4.0,Comfortable.  Way to long in legs.
4.0,Really nice hat well made - but run really big.  Trying to return but can not get a return label - not where Amazon says it is.
4.0,"I am so happy I ordered this dress. It’s a little big around the middle, but I’ll cinch the dress in with a belt.  The quality is pretty decent, and it washes well without fading."
4.0,"Is not the best one that i bought, but is good for a good price."
4.0,Cute shoe but does run small
4.0,"Very nice shape and style, but a little big, but that could be just cause I have a small head, lol."
4.0,Comfortable and fits good as any sandal I have ever owned. I would recommend this sandal.
4.0,"I wore this mask for a winter masquerade party. I thought that this would work well because of the color and the style. Overall I was pleased with the mask. It conformed to my face fairly well, although the nose was a bit rigid and did not sit as flat as I would have liked. My biggest issue that I had with it was that there was one spot that had become folded over at some point during the shipping process (I assume) and it would not straighten out even with sustained pressure. I ended up just cutting that bit off as the rest of the mask was fine. I received many compliments on the mask and will most likely use it again in the future."
4.0,Feel more comfortable layering these under other tops rather than wear alone. The shelf bra comfortable but not super supportive. The tops fit well and came earlier than originally quoted.
4.0,"Super cute top! I love the seahorse design and the top fit me perfectly. I ordered a size XL and I'm a 5'6&#34; woman weighing 220 lbs. my only complaint is that my top came with a tear along the seam of my left side. It was an easy fix so I didn't have to return it, but I would have preferred not to have to see up a brand new shirt. Otherwise, I love the top and I would probably buy again."
4.0,"Bottoms are somewhat see-through, I probably should have sized up from what I got - but I expected that, and I really only bought it for the purpose of lounging around the house and because the top is breastfeeding accessible. (It works great for that btw!) When I walk the dog I wear it with a shrug and it’s fine. It is very comfortable and super cute."
4.0,Love them. Wear them every day!
4.0,An
4.0,Case is great! Necklace is cheap and I quickly replaced it with a keychain attachment.
4.0,Fits perfectly in my tragus piercing!
4.0,"this top fits as expected, I am a 34 DD for reference. this top holds the girls the only complaint is that the bottom tends to roll up and a little bit of side boob."
4.0,Really cute and not huge
4.0,"Very cute shirt. I ordered a size up since these things tend to run small, but turns out I should have stuck with my normal size. I'm going to exchange it for a smaller size as i still really want the shirt."
4.0,These shoes are a beautiful color just as pictured they runs small
4.0,"Very pretty top. I really like the item and wanted to give it a 5 star. However, the shipping was way toooo slow. I bought a couple of more stuff that's from China but they are all arrived within like 3 weeks at least. This one took way more than 1 month and I was dying waiting. The product is great with no defects though."
4.0,"These are pretty great. No show socks are difficult overall to ensure they don't slip, but these do pretty well. The grip at the back is pretty awesome."
4.0,This is a V neck not a crew neck.
4.0,"This dress is surprisingly awesome! It’s cozy but sexy which is my aesthetic. It fits very true to size, I wish they had solid colors in it, I’d wear them all!"
4.0,"If I were to buy again, I’d probably go up a size just for comfort. Fits well across the bust, but I’d like a bit more room around the hip and butt area."
4.0,I ordered a large size because everyone said I should (I'm 5&#34;5' 140 lbs) It's too big. Will it shrink? Has anyone washed it? If it shrinks a bit it will fit fine!
4.0,The earrings are beautiful and are very lightweight. I almost thought they were plastic.
4.0,"I'm 160lbs and 5'9"" the large fits perfect. Super soft, I'll definitely be buying more."
4.0,"Incredibly comfortable sweater--I love wearing it.  The style is cute and flattering (but don't size up, it is semi-fitted).  The lace inset looks a little straggly after a while; I'd love to see this same pattern without the lace."
4.0,"I like them, but they are a little small.  I ordered the biggest (XL), and they were a tiny bit small to get on.  I feel they'll stretch over time, so should fit OK.  I have big hands, but if you have really big hands, you will probably NOT be able to put these on.<br /><br />I like the little tabs in the middle two fingers, which aid in pulling them off. Padding isn't much, but should add to comfort.  Only used them twice so far, so time will tell.  Right now, I like them, they're comfortable..  If they don't hold up, I'll edit this review accordingly."
4.0,"This is a nice necktie set. My husband usually wears silk ties, but I liked the color scheme, so I ordered them. When they arrived, he said that he liked them as well, and had added them to his collection.<br /><br />This set includes two neckties: a pink and white striped “repp tie” and a pink and purple diamond tie. The striped tie is essentially the same width as my husband’s other ties, but the purple tie is significantly narrower.<br /><br />Presentation is nice- the ties arrived rolled up in a black cardboard box. This set would make a nice gift for anyone looking for something more budget-friendly than silk."
4.0,"This dress is absolutely perfect! The fit is exactly what I wanted! I am a size 16/18 and carry most of my weight lower, this dress fits me perfectly in a Large. The material is soft and has a great stretch. There is slight weight to the fabric so it won't blow up easily on a windy day. I am 5'5 and it hits just below the knee. This dress would have a five star rating if the pockets were deeper, since I can just barely fit my hands in them. Otherwise I am extremely satisfied and will be purchasing more in other colors."
4.0,Not a heavy material but an excellent buy for the money! Thanks
4.0,"Bought it for my cousin. He's about 5'8, 200lb.  Bought him an XL. It fits him just a tad bit tight but not tight enough to he uncomfortable. Great and conveniently costume for those wanting to be tanjiro."
4.0,"Got this watch today, and have to say...for the price it is an excellent watch! Attractive, works great and feels like it is a quality made watch. Great for business casual dress or just going out for the night. Showing it to my friends, and asking them how much they thought I payed for it, they all thought over $100.00! Even got $200.00 from a couple. Needless to say that they where shocked when I told them under $30. Would definitely recommend to a friend!"
4.0,Es ta bonito no esta tan grueso pero esta bien
4.0,The product fix right in the existing hole. This was just a replacement item.
4.0,5’6 weigh 140. Ordered large and it’s perfect. A tad bit sheer but not too revealing. Pleased.
4.0,"This is a really cute tank, but is a little see through. I purchased this to wear with a long skirt for a wedding, and had to wear a white tabk top underneath, which I could see the lines through this tank. It is a nice material, and color, but I wish it was just a little less see through."
4.0,It's nice cool casual wear for a hot day!
4.0,Very pretty! Runs small
4.0,I really like the retro styled gown . Only thing is it’s having only net/mesh over shoulder . Which doesn’t suit me so I returned this otherwise the fall of material & dosing is really beautiful .
4.0,"Love the check pattern and fluffy material; arms too long for a small and length a bit long, but width (wrap around) was def a size small. The deal breaker for me was the NO pockets. Sadly will be returning."
4.0,Perfect tiny hoop earring.
4.0,"Good quality, but butt and thighs are a bit tight, so if you are blessed with badonkadonk, order a size up."
4.0,"Although it's not a dot patter, it's a bunch of tiny &#34;M&#34;'s, it's definitely a well made shirt! Unfortunately the 4XL (XL) did not fit my husband who typically wears a US L but we think it's due to it being a &#34;slim fit&#34; type shirt. We both love the way it looks and feels though so we're gonna keep it as a goal shirt since he's been loosing weight anyway. Great quality though!"
4.0,"When I bought my iwatch I was so excited I love gagits. I didn't want to get the one that was crazy pricey just for a band. So I made sure to find a replacement band that had a more girly look to it. This one fit the bill I like sparkly accessories. It's made well  and I love it, my only problem was the glittery strap part that holds the band down was scratching my skin, from the glitter on the band. So I took it off flipped it around so the smooth side was to my skin. No more scratching.  Also the part that connects to the iwatch scratches a little, and is now pretty much gone with wear.  I will still be buying it again and In different colors."
4.0,Love the pants.. Size was a slightly larger
4.0,"Look very nice, and well made, worth the price!!!!!"
4.0,"These definitly kept my luggage more organized! Fun design, and funtional"
4.0,Those that claim that these fit their feet tight obviously have wide feet.  I have an average size foot and they fit great and were very comfortable during my trip to the Caribbean.....I used them as beach sandals.
4.0,This is a nice set of rings but the true size is more like a tight 8 for the larger ring and a 5.5 for the smaller ring.
4.0,"these leggings are nice and lightweight, my only issue that you can see through them:( Would've given these 5 stars if they were a bit thicker."
4.0,A little small but still worked for me.<br />Good quality for a good price :)
4.0,I love this brand.  Great quality.  I have several tees.  All run large.  I reorder tank in a smaller size.  The tees I tie at the side.
4.0,Good quality product. Great for running.
4.0,the material is nice and snug
4.0,I bought this as a secret Santa gift for a coworker and she uses it every chance she gets. Now I want to purchase one to knock about in.
4.0,It's a little to big but I still love the watch. I'll just get a link taken out.
4.0,The laces are good quality and pretty thick. Let me tell you it is a lot better than ASICS laces that come with the shoe. The magnet lock is really nice but it is so hard to try to get the small screw in the hole.
4.0,Beautiful dress. Just runs way too small!! I think the large is probably more like a small. I would try the XXL but it's not a Prime product and I don't feel like waiting forever to get it.
4.0,Luck than i bought 2 sizes up for The comments
4.0,This is really cute. I found it in event category. I returned ot because the fabric was casual. It like a Jersey t shirt. I needed something dressier. I almost lept it but I had no need for it.
4.0,Vey cute and lightweight
4.0,"I like how this dress fits my 5’3 200lb body, although it’s rather cheap, easily wrinkled fabric. I also have a 38 DDD bust and this dress was slightly ill fitting around my chest, it made it look like the waist line was high up.<br /><br />I bought two of these dresses, and would recommend them for the cheap price and comfy fit!<br /><br />Also don’t throw any of the packaging away, you’ll need it ALL if you need to return them"
4.0,"It's a little on the small side, but other than that it's beautiful and well made !!"
4.0,"What can you say about cycling gloves?  A lot actually.  How well do they grip the handles?  How well do they fit?  Do they stretch easily, becoming loose on your hand within a few uses?  Are they easy to take on/off?  How is the padding?<br /><br />These gloves, for the price, aren't too bad.  Since it's winter I haven't really used the UV arm protectors except as very lightweight arm warmers.  They're more like the material of women's tights than the thick fabric of traditional arm sleeves so funtion surprisingly well as a warming base layer under a windbreaker in slightly chilly temps.<br /><br />On to the gloves.  The grippy pads on the palm are fairly sticky.  I was able to use them to sandwich slipery materials between my hands and easily hold them in place.  A strange test, but fun to do, and verifies the grippiness of the material.  These worked surprisingly well for wet items even, and the gloves dried quickly afterwards.  All in all, not bad so far.<br /><br />What about getting these gloves on/off?  Well, getting them on is easy enough.  But even though there are little folds sewn into the middle fingers for pulling the gloves off, it can be a little bit of a struggle to do without turning the gloves inside out.  Really it's a minor problem, since it also means the gloves stay fairly well fitted even after continual use.<br /><br />The padding in the palm is basically nonexistent and that's really the only failing point of these gloves.  More padding would be nice, but good grips on your bike can do the same thing.  In fact, with the right grips, you won't even need gloves really.<br /><br />Anyway, if you're looking for gloves that won't break the bank, and wouldn't mind some super lightweight arm sleeves for free, you could do much worse.  These gloves are about the same quality as everything else in their price range."
4.0,A bit longer and tighter than excepted also see through.
4.0,I'm using this vest for hiking. The pockets are useful. The netting in the back is useful.
4.0,"Nice maternity top. Soft fabric with a bit of stretch. It did shrink a bit after a wash and dry. Overall pretty cute! You couldn’t really wear it as a tunic top, it’s too short. I’m 34 weeks pregnant, 5’4” and 160 lbs. and it fit me well. The crisscross in the back is a nice detail."
4.0,"This is a good product;long enough, soft and comfortable. I like the convertible mitten that is attahec. However, note that like all convertible mittens the thumbs are not cut short and that reduces the function of fingerless gloves about 50%."
4.0,Beautiful top -I expected a 3x to have more room.  As I loose more weight I’m sure it will be okay
4.0,"These are pretty nice! You get a lot for your money. Good for losing weight.<br /><br />Metal chains:<br />-The chain that has large rhinstones is more gold than the other three. It even came ina different type of small plastic bag. If you look at the pics, youll see the difference between the two chains laid on the floor as well as the difference between on of the chains and a gold plated anklet I already owned.<br /><br />-Im afraid they might turn if I get them wet so wont let them get wet.<br /><br />-The chain with rhinstones is larger in diameter than the others. I am 6'0 and wear a large. Not sure my actual waist circumference. The three chains that dont have rhinstones just barely dont fit. The good thing is that these chains can be used 5for tracking weightloss so hopefully Ill be able to wear them soon. Theyre really pretty.<br /><br />Beaded Chains:<br />-all of them are stretch. They dont clasp, they dont tie like traditional waist beads do. What this means is that they most likely will fit you. They fit my waist perfectly and snugly without any gaps in between beads. I was nervous to stretch them over my head but they do a great job stretching. The downside of them stretching rather than clasping is that while you will notice as you gain and lose weight (they will get tighter and looser on you) it wont be as easily noticeable as tied beads. The tied beads will feel tight if you gain weight and remind you to watch what you eat for a little while. The other downside is that theyre easily removable so you can easily quit using them for weightloss tracking. However, others may like that they are easily removable for fashion reasons.<br /><br />Overall, I gave these waist beads four stars. Im not sure about the quality of the metals and I will update. I also highly suggest ordering these on etsy or facebook marketplace to support a local craftsman as waist beads are an african tradition and hold a lot more value and meaning that what meets the eye on amazon."
4.0,Bigger than i thought but that’s fine. The color in the pic looks more mustard colored but it’s sunshine yellow. Too bright for me but it’s great for around the house.
4.0,"This blouse is pretty cute and perfect for summer.It is true to size,comfortable,the quality is not the best but still ok.Nice blouse and very elegant."
4.0,Super cute top. It fits well everywhere except the puff sleeve is too big. The top goes down my shoulder more than I'd like making the puff sleeve stick out in the wrong area. Otherwise it is really cute.
4.0,"I love the color of these compression socks. I ordered the small/medium size even though I should have ordered a large because I take a size 9 to 9.5 shoe. Nevertheless, these fit me perfectly and the large would have been too big. The compression is strong, so I do find these difficult to wear all day.  The only thing I do not like about these socks is that they come up to my lower thighs which requires me to fold them over to get them below my knees."
4.0,"Came in fast,  used them for one day  and lost them !!"
4.0,Happy with the product and material. Did not shrink when washed or machine dried. However they are a little tight.
4.0,"Very cute, got this for my boyfriend for christmas. Only thing I am disappointed about is that it says “Bombae” with an E instead of a Y at the end."
4.0,Not sure what they mean by battery life it’s socks and a hat also the socks were kind of big for my husband also I wish they had them in women’s sizes because Dewalt is the brand of tools I use on the job as well
4.0,She loved the color. Wanted a little more padding.
4.0,Not the softest head wrap I have my head is balding from chemotherapy it’s directly on my scalp and it’s not very cooling or soft now if you have hair that’s a different story it would be perfect for anyone with hair and they have a lot of different colors but I’m not going to buy another one from here
4.0,Fits well. Thumbs are a little long
4.0,I like it. It really does the job to keep you warm. The only problem I found was that the pants elastic band are too tight; I am a slim person but it's still feel tight at my waist.
4.0,"The shirt has a vintage feel to it, which is what I wanted. It actually fits pretty good, however I wasn't expecting the material to feel the way it did, more of a polyester feel. But overall happy with it."
4.0,Received on time and as described. Price was good as I was not interested in buying replacements bands in packs of three and wanted a different color than black.
4.0,"Bought mine for cosplay. They come very small by default but are easily adjusted to size with careful bending using a pliers. Starting bending at the thickest end of the prong and work your way to the thinnest end at the gap to avoid breaking the metal. I spray painted mine a darker silver. The paint sticks well, looks great and takes away the cheapy super shiny silver. Overall good deal for the price and a fun accessory for my cosplay. Happy claw clacking!!"
4.0,ADORABLE!!! Perfect easter dress! The only negative is that it gets wrinkled pretty easily but not that big of a deal-
4.0,Waist could be a skoch larger...or I need to loose weight. Probably the latter...
4.0,They were soft and comfortable.
4.0,Great value. Performs as advertised.
4.0,"Very cute, a little large in fit but wonderful travel slippers"
4.0,The dress is very pretty and fits fairly tight from the waist down extremely loose around the breast area.
4.0,Can't tighten enough
4.0,Smaller sized. Order a size or two up.
4.0,Nice and long wristlet. It has a lot of space. It kinda has a smell but it didn't bother me as long as I can fit everything I need. The zipper is not the highest quality so I think it wont last long.
4.0,"Very sexy! I'm petite and busty, so it fit me fine but anyone over 5'6"" with any curves at all will be disappointed unless they want to wear it as lingerie or as a top.<br />Even as a top, it's really a good buy, though.<br />The lace is somewhat stretchy but it could use more spandex for the busty ladies."
4.0,I ordered black leggings for workout! It’s nicely designed and very comfortable material. The material is think and of quality cloth. Couple of cons are that it runs a little small so I would order a size up. I’m 4”11. Also it doesn’t stay on your stomach even though it’s supposed to be high rise. The price should be comparable.
4.0,The hat completed the perfect costume for a circus themed event!
4.0,Great Leo
4.0,"I purchased this product a size up, and it fits well for my purpose.  It is not the type of dress I would wear to a party, but the dress is super comfortable.  I have worn it to a family member's backyard BBQs (She was in the next community over from mine) and to grocery shopping.  I also like to wear it when relaxing/lounging around the house or when expecting company, which was why I purchased the dress in the first place.  I pair it with an open-toe two inch rubber wedge shoes (which the dress mostly covers, I'm 5' 7&#34; and 155lbs) that I wear around the house: the shoes add a bit of elegance to the dress -- so I look attractive for me and my guest.  This is a nice comfortable frock, but like most attire, you must carefully determine the appropriate purpose for its use."
4.0,Wish it included nose rubbers as well.
4.0,Not as big as I would want for plus phone.
4.0,I just got the sunglasses and like them a lot.  The lens is great in the sun and in low light conditions.
4.0,It is a well built belt. It also is the proper length as ordered.
4.0,"Good material , ordered a large and fits like a medium because other comments said size runs small .  Color and form are as pictured ."
4.0,A tad tight. Will use for sleeping.
4.0,"They took over a month to get them, but we're decent in quality.  I wish they were a little longer but do what we need them to do - keep our badges with us lol"
4.0,"So cute!  Only issue is that it's a bit short if you have a longer torso.  Bending over is not a great idea.  Very nice though, and perfect for the summer!"
4.0,"This is a beautiful scarf, with bright bold colors. Love it and can't wait to wear it. Did not receive the key ring that was suppose to come with it."
4.0,Very clean. Smaller that expected but its perfect.
4.0,Nice top. Nicely made comfortable to wear. I will be buying more. Nice and long so you can wear under other shirts.
4.0,Soft and thin - maybe a bit too thin as I am expecting my toe to pop through sooner than later but I like them.
4.0,Great for beginner walkers since they are soft and flexible; it doesn't trip up their feet and protects at the same time.
4.0,"Fits well, product was quality and style expected. Seems good quality for price, dies fold up into pocket as advertised. Hoping it is warm enough for winter."
4.0,"The case is nice, but the Velcro closure needs help. My hubby used this case 1 time and the bottom piece of Velcro failed to stay put. So it needed repaired. That's the reason for only 4 stars."
4.0,"Fits better than expected, not too short, top is loose enough to be forgiving..quality seems pretty good."
4.0,I love this crossbody bag.  It's a good look with the nylon camo design. I wished it had an inside slip pocket to put my eye glasses in. I would like to see this as another purse in a little larger size.
4.0,They are comfy and my phone doesn't fal out of the pocket when I run!
4.0,"Great affordable gift to add to my thank-you bag for bridesmaids! Quality could be slightly better, but honestly for the price it is a very nice bracelet."
4.0,The rubber at the bottom makes it very comfortable to wear but quite expensive
4.0,After a year the #12 fell off it's spot and ra disappear from the word inside the watch. At 18 months the clasp broke and can not be fix at a jewelers. When contacting the company and sending the purchasing info no response. So the watch I really like that I have can not be worn. I really like it and may buy it again.<br />Should I or should I look elsewhere?
4.0,Buen producto y practico
4.0,"I think the quality of this is fine for the price. The fabric is extremely stretchy and although the collar was snug around my neck it wasn't tight, it was just formal. It looks alright, but I found that it fit a little smaller than I'm used to. I was hoping it wasn't asian sizing, and it's not quite asian sizing, but it was definitely snug. I'm usually a 1x in forever 21 items with stretch and a 2x in items with less stretch, but I think for this dress to fit and be appropriate for work, which is why I purchased it, I would need a 3 or 4x.<br /><br />But if you're willing to order a size or two up, I find the quality to be fine. The arms were snug, but not constricting, even though I have large arms. It has a lot of stretch and hugs curves well.<br /><br />I originally purchased this item at a discount in exchange for an honest review, but the company isn't even asking me for a review anymore, they cancelled that. I'm just reviewing it now for your info."
4.0,Good gym bag wish the she compartment had a plastic shell so I don't have to force the  shoes in sometimes
4.0,"This is a really nice summer outfit, but it fit a little weird in my hip/waist area where the waist line was a little too high. The chest fit nicely, it could be flattering, but maybe on someone a little more petite or shoulder... with the waist a little high and the pants a little short (I am 5'8""). the outfit looked ill fitting."
4.0,"Good quality and weight. Not too light or too heavy. I'm not enough of a fanboy to know if the characters are exact Star Wars alphabet or whatever, but if not it should be able to fool a casual fan. Actually, I'm really surprised Disney hasn't trademarked this what with the scene with Luke giving Leia Han's dice in The Last Jedi. Who knows, maybe they have and this is an off brand that doesn't have exact official characters on the dice. I don't know. But, good product so far and fun to hang on the rearview mirror. Giving four stars because the chain could be a couple inches longer. Probably not tough enough to put on your keychain though."
4.0,seem soft enough but fingers are long..strange
4.0,"14 too big, 12 too little, besides that is a fun ring.  Probably best for costumes.  It is not practical to wear around."
4.0,"These glasses help with the glare at night, but not the starbursts that come from headlights especially if you have cataracts. Also, for women's glasses they are a bit wider than I expected them to be."
4.0,"I bought this for my mom. She's about 5'7 and a US size 14. No hips or butt and a little stomach, so the curve illusion really worked for her. Loved the colors and size of the print. Unfortunately, since it isnt a real jacket, it looked weird from behind, on her. (if you've got a little booty, you'll be fine)<br />Had to grudgingly return it.<br /><br />Also, its tiny sizing, so this is a 2XXL."
4.0,"Cute, color suitable.  Material definitely inexpensive and unwearable to work"
4.0,It was a little smaller than I wanted. My glasses barely fit in the case. My shades don’t fit.
4.0,"I really like the way this shirt fits, recommendable !!!"
4.0,This shirt is super comfortable and I love the design! The coloration is not thw same as the picture... the words are not the same color as pictured. Still looks nice and I still like it but that's why it's 4 stars. 😊
4.0,"It’s alright, fits the watch fits the wrist. Might wanna get a screen protector with it to actually protect the screen"
4.0,We used these fabric squares for a science fair porject and then gave them to our Sunday School class for bandanas.  They served our purpose for the science fair project but when the fabric is not folded it seemed thin (see through).
4.0,"I'd give it a 5 star review, but the extra velcro makes it look weird. Other than that, my son absolutely loves it and is treating like a treasure lol. It has a great simple design. I also think it perfect for kids trying to learn how to tell time with the minute value on the outside.<br /><br />Also, if you think it stopped working just remember to push the dial INTO the watch, as pulling it OUT is required when you adjust the time."
4.0,"size runs way too large, material is very soft"
4.0,"I was pleasantly surprised given the price, these lenses are great and a perfect fit into my Oakleys.  Would not hesitate to buy them again."
4.0,"My Moccasins arrived yesterday I inspected the quality which was sturdy and nicely made,tried them on nice fit,not to much fur inside(which I like) will be ordering 2 more pair one for me and my Daughter..just a FYI all reviews were helpful to me with making my decision on purchasing product..plus anything that I order I have been durable products especially my shoes..I’m Always a Happy Camper from high end-low end prices items💜"
4.0,"This Ocatoma Bluetooth Beanie is just what I was looking for now that the weather is cooling and Daylight Savings is ending. If it's going to be dark out by 6pm, I'd like to have a light on when I'm walking the dog, and if I can take calls or listen to music without needing earbuds, even better.<br /><br />The Beanie fits over my 24 inch around head, though with no much room left. I'm able to get the light above my eyes and the earpieces lined up comfortably. The light is bright, and offers high, medium, and low modes. The Bluetooth is easy to pair and use, and the sound is actually really good. The earpieces are larger than those in other items, like Bluetooth sleep masks, since you won't have a pillow pushing them against your head.<br /><br />There is an included micro USB cable for charging the Bluetooth headset. You have to insert it through a hole in the fabric, but you can't see the port, so remember, the shorter side of the charging tip faces the Bluetooth label. As for the light, it just snaps out and plugs directly into a USB port. Everything can be removed before washing the cap.<br /><br />Hope you find the pictures and review to be helpful!"
4.0,A bit awkward to get on at first fit but the support is as expected. The straps are wide and comfortable and stay put.
4.0,"I love the shirt. I wish I had gotten the size I ordered 😂 i ordered the medium and got a 6x, so its not fair to comment on fit. But I will say it seems well made, the lace is soft and I like that it has the material behind it for modesty sake. Everything is securely sewn, the material light and soft. Id definitely recommend and will try to get my size 🙂"
4.0,"I was worried the jeans would be too small due to reviews but I gambled. I am a 12<br /> because it is &#34;skinny jeans&#34;  and juniors I got a 14. The 14 fits but the 12 would have featured my assesets better.<br /><br />The material stretches to fit within thirty to 45minutes if wearing them.<br /><br />I love there are actual, usable front, side, and cargo pockets. It is a relief because I hate fake pockets. The jeans are so comfortable.<br /><br />I will be ordering more in different styles soon."
4.0,Good quality and fast shipping. A little pricey.
4.0,Cute but a bit see through and ran big.
4.0,"Overall great fit, legs are long, had to hem about 6"" off but I'm only 5'1."
4.0,"The earrings are very pretty, but not well made. I'm keeping them because I purchased them for a cheaper price, if I paid full price I would return them."
4.0,It’s pretty good zippers are a little sticky I feel like it won’t be long till they break
4.0,The glasses were delivered in a nice sturdy box with a cloth bag used to carry them in.<br />They are polarized glasses which is a must for me - though the don't seem a strong as my other pair (Ray Bans)<br /><br />Understand these are 40$  and thus do not expect them to feel like a 150-200$ pair of other sunglasses - and they don't<br />The frames are light and feel a bit plasticy - yet they are doing the job<br /><br />I have a fairly small head so anyone with a larger dimensioned head shape would probably not like these .
4.0,"If you are aware that it is thin material then go ahead and buy it. I don't know what the material is but its very different. But it gets the job done, is very flattering and I love it for chilly sunset beach walks!"
4.0,It's a nice shirt but its compressed. I usually go for loose clothes not really that bad of a shirt though.
4.0,"I need to wear a mask at work, but not all of the time.  The strap allows me to always have it, but not always strapped to my ears.  I gave my boss one, and he likes it as well."
4.0,"Well, darn! This thing fits most of my bug out essentials... and that’s 10% of my body weight in survival gear!!! The only things I’d say are not so swell are the zippers and the straps on the buckles. There’s no food and sew on the ends of the straps for the buckles, making them hard to grip when sweaty or wet to tighten them.. secondly, the zippers were all kinda.. half open while the actual zipper part was all the way shut. No biggie, pulled the zipper back and it all opened and closed like nothing had happened."
4.0,"Surprisingly good quality for something so inexpensive. It's on the large side so if you have small wrists, it will definitely fall off. I like it."
4.0,"This shirt runs somewhat small. I usually wear a 2x. Based on the other reviews, I got a 3x and it fits perfectly!!!"
4.0,I think it will work.
4.0,First shirt like this I've purchased and it checks all the boxes. Comfortable fit and looks good!<br /><br />Update: the olive colored shirt buttons the wrong way.
4.0,Very pretty but very delicate fabric. Nice color
4.0,"Basic kid stretch gloves, I’d say they run small though, my three yr old fits fine but no extra room with his long long fingers, but my 7 yr old they are way too small."
4.0,really like this shirt
4.0,Soft and movable
4.0,These rings are very comfortable but after wearing a few weeks I noticed the white lines starting to wear off the flag.  Also note if you are going to wear 24 x 7 when you shower or wash your hand dry under the ring very well or they hold moisture around you finger causing skin to turn white and peel.
4.0,"This is a nice bracelet.  It is smaller than it appears.  Nevertheless, it is nice.  The company ships with efficiency."
4.0,"small, but strong."
4.0,Love my sun glasses it’s clear I can see everything good just love it
4.0,"My only complaint is that for a women, this shirt fits a little snug in the chest but it was exactly what I was looking for to wear on my 40th birthday!"
4.0,Normally wear a medium--large is comfy.
4.0,I love this set and I bought it in red and blue.<br />I just don’t like the fact the the shirt color does not match the shirt stripes.  Otherwise nice set!
4.0,"Buy one size bigger than you usually do. They run small. I wear XL and bought XXL and they fit great.<br />Very light and breathable, so comfortable I'm buying three more to just wear on my off days"
4.0,Bought to help me train for the NYC marathon. Fit tight and do a nice job. I wear a size 9 running shoe.
4.0,"This is adorable. The texture of the shirt is like stretchy silky like material, I don't know what it's called, but it's not silk obviously. The only thing is that the patches on the jeans instead of being white they look like the jean material colored them a blue color which I didn't wash them yet so it wasn't that.<br /><br />Bought for her baby sisters baby shower because we are having a taco bout a baby theme and the cactus fit in perfectly!<br /><br />It's a thin material and long sleeves which is perfect for our spring weather in TN.<br /><br />She's 28lbs and 35.5 inches tall!"
4.0,"Loved the glasses, just to big for my small face. However, that is the style these days! Wearing them proudly!"
4.0,"Just received today. The only part I don't like is the clasp on the band is very difficult to use. I already purchased a nato band for it anyway so I never intended to use the leather band that came with it. Tritium is just right, not too bright but bright enough to see the time clearly in total dark. Very good quality construction, nice size and weight. I will update this post after six months so we can see how well it holds up but first impression is that it's a damn fine watch! Update, so after about 6 months of nonstop wear I have to say I'm extremely impressed. The movement has only lost about 45 seconds which is almost unheard of. I have several high end watches that don't hold a candle to this model. I can't believe they aren't more popular and higher priced. I am already shopping for another one but this time I'm going for a formal look, I tried putting a stainless steel band on this one but it just didn't look right. If you are looking for a tritium watch at a great price then you should definitely buy from these guys, you won't be disappointed. Be aware the watch band is not a typical style but I had already decided to use a nylon band before I even purchased the watch."
4.0,works for 2 of my over sized hats
4.0,"Very happy with the watch, for the price it was more than I expected, highly recommended"
4.0,I find I don't use it very often. It's a great concept for someone who is willing to always maneuver their items back into it when they are done using it. I just don't have that patience.
4.0,"Nice, lightweight and flowy romper. Beware the v neckline is pretty deep as well as wide. Given this, its not possible to pull off without something appropriate underneath."
4.0,"These are better than I'd expected.  They're not noticeably scratchy-- though scratchiness is less of an issue on the foot than in a sweater for instance.  I hate scratchy clothes and these socks don't bother me.  They fit well-- I wear a sz 9 shoe.  They're quite warm.  I can't stand the green or light-grey colors because those look terrible with everything, but if you can bring yourself to wear all the colors, it's an excellent number of socks for the price.  I'd describe them as medium-thick."
4.0,"Perfect for the price.  Wanted something simple and not too expensive for running, cycling and backpacking and this fits the bill.  I'm 5'11&#34; and it works for me just fine.  However, the length may be too short for anyone over 6 foot.  More than ample protection from the rain and will do well to insulate heat during cold evenings backpacking."
4.0,"I am a 28 D and I am happy with the size that I ordered of XL for these bras. The only issue that I've noticed is that when I move up and down I can hear the pads going up and down with my body. I have had other sports bras and I normally haven't had this issue. However, I am still ranking it four stars because the function and support is still there. I work out at a public gym so there is always music blaring and no one will be able to hear the fabric moving up and down. I am very happy with the price I paid for the bundle! I couldn't find a better price like this anywhere else."
4.0,"Purchased to dress up the lapel on a suit/vest. It looks like the picture. So I was not disappointed at all. Paired it with other faux pearls, faux diamonds, and strands of faux jewels that I pinned on the lapel.  It turned out nice."
4.0,"These are to wear to work under a jacket. They are a little loose around the armpit. Good colors to match my wardrobe. Overall good, although I would order my usual size next time"
4.0,cute would recemend but kinda hard to adjust
4.0,The weight
4.0,Pendant is pretty large.
4.0,pretty gel bracelets good for matching up for the holidays.
4.0,Love it! But a bit too big for me. Size small fit me like a medium. I am 5’1” and 130lbs. Great material and soft
4.0,Good arm length and good seams
4.0,I received a lot of compliments on this dress!!
4.0,Use for play cast
4.0,"I got a medium and it is a bigger than I would have liked but it does have breathable room. I tried the small and that was tight on my legs. I am 5""6"" 134lbs and I got a medium. Wouldn't buy another pair"
4.0,Love the bracelet but a planet broke off first time wearing it. Waiting on the seller to contact me back to see what the next steps are. But it is beautiful and I love it. I just wish it didn't break :(
4.0,"Nice fit, and always high quality."
4.0,Sizes run small. I'm a 33 waist and ordered large. They fit but are a little tight all around. No bad but used to other boxers being a little more roomy. By their standards I should be medium but next time I'll order extra large.
4.0,"Soft and comfy. I like that the sleeves are a little longer, they come down to just above my elbows."
4.0,"Like glasses, described as photochromic, they are not.<br />But as sunglasses go they're pretty good value."
4.0,A little on the larger side
4.0,The waist could be made slightly slimmer.
4.0,It helps to keep your things organized so it works for me.
4.0,"Cute dress and got lots of compliments. Could have worn either a large or medium, but went with medium because I liked more snug fit. Dress is cheaply made and thin, but looked good on."
4.0,I wear a Lg and ordered a medium and they fit nice and tight. Use them a lot for the gym and they don't roll down!
4.0,Material is very comfortable and is form fitting. I would recommend this .
4.0,Its cute. Wife liked it.
4.0,fit ok material kind of thin.
4.0,"These rings arrived very fast!  I opened the box and was blown away at how beautiful the rings were!  I immediately tried them on and they are a perfect fit.  My only (and small) problem is that they are a lot chunkier than I perceived them to be in the pictures.  Very thick which I suppose means they are durable!  Otherwise, they are really quite breathtaking!"
4.0,Ordered but returned. Good quality but was a bit smaller than i was looking for.
4.0,Design and quality is very nice!!
4.0,"The necklace set came in 2 layers of chain, 1st with a long chain with 1 conch pendant and the 2nd inner layer consisting of Hawaii cowrie seashell woven necklace. Both the layers could be worn together or can be worn separately according to one’s likes and preferences. This set conch and shell necklace set looks simple yet pretty. It is not too tight on my neck unlike my other conch necklace, neither too heavy to wear. There is an extension chain in necklace to fit different neck sizes. It forms a great accessory to wear for beach vacations and lake parties."
4.0,"I'm a &#34;small&#34; person so was concerned as to size; they are a larger hoop than I had anticipated. That said, I wore them Sunday and my husband thought they looked really good therefore I'm really pleased and I liked the quality."
4.0,"Nice color, stretch fabric, good length and affordable"
4.0,Love the glasses. Definitely worth the price.
4.0,"I'm 5'10"" and 220lbs. The pants seem to wear fine in the hip and thighs but, like every other athletic-wear vendor,  they bunch up around my ankles from being too long. I bought a size smaller than what I normally do in hopes of a regular length pant leg, alas, it isn't meant to be. I guess I'd rather 2 inches too long rather than 2 inches too short. Initial wear and wash hasn't yielded any surprises."
4.0,Only complaint is i wish it was a little larger or had more light to allow night time walking. Otherwise good product.
4.0,"Watch when washing, colors may run"
4.0,"The earrings are very pretty.  But I took off one star for some little petty things:<br />1.  The fishhooks are too small for the size of the earrings.  These are large earrings and they should have larger fishhooks.<br />2.  The fishhooks look tarnished, not pretty like the rest of the earring.<br />3.  The inner beads on one of the earrings are bunched together and don't hang evenly.<br />Like I said, these are little petty things.  Over all I like the earrings and intend to continue wearing them."
4.0,gold sand stone looks more orange-ish than I would like but i still like these.
4.0,Bought this for my daughter whom is obsessed with all things French AND macaroons.  Nice item.
4.0,"A nice bag for gym...my husband usually goes from work so it goes with his work attire  I don't like how weak the zipper feels however as long as you don't over stuff the bag, it should hold up"
4.0,I am 5'9 and 185 pounds the xl fit a little snug around the waist but wearable. The length was perfect.
4.0,"You get what you pay for and this one is clearly a cheap creation, but the front makes up for it by being beautiful. Can't wait for my girlfriend to wear this. She loved it."
4.0,"This fits to size and serves its purpose for me: I wear for morning outdoors to protect my arms and neck from pesky bugs in the park I walk.  I don't have the physique to wear this for fashion, but if you do, it will do well by your physique.  But I didn't get it for fashion; I got it for functionality and it functions perfectly for me.  (I could wear it for fashion, but I'd look silly as it is form-fitting, and I'm not)."
4.0,"They're small, but very, very pretty. I would have given 5 stars, but the backs don't go on easily and when I tried to force one on, the stone seemed to give, now I'm afraid I've pushed it loose and will lose it."
4.0,"This is a nice weight hoodie, also warm.  However, it is a bit tight at the bottom. I have a slender physique and was surprised how narrow it is.  I guess I could stretch it out. Other than that, it's a great hoodie."
4.0,I ordered the large it was a little snugmayne could have got xl I’m 5 ”8 170  38c/d but I do t know tbe x large might be too big tbe large was snug but worked . I like tbe color style and design
4.0,"Very comfortable and true to size.  There was a slight chemical smell when they arrived, but I washed the pj's and the smell was gone.  I am a size 12/14 and ordered the large."
4.0,This is very cute.  It runs a little big but he'll grow into it.  Its also navy and red even though the description says black and red.
4.0,gave as a gift to a young girl she loved it!
4.0,"I really like them, had to order a size larger, they run a bit small. My only complaint is they are really short, 3 more inches in length would make them perfect."
4.0,"So far it's exactly what we were looking for. Perfect sizes, great zippers<br />There is an odor but with some airing out it goes away.<br />I am wondering if the wheels are replaceable? I have NOT had any issue with them but I'm pretty sure with the rough handling at airports that will be an issue!<br />Great color selection to help thur luggage stand out."
4.0,"I got these for a costume. For that purpose it works fine. However I had the same issue that another reviewer had, namely that it's not as clear in the pictures as it is in real life how sheer they are. I, like the other reviewer, would have preferred something more opaque and less sheer. They are sheer enough that the pink doesn't come out enough in normal light but they certainly would stand out under black lights!"
4.0,"Very nice piece of jewelry I like that I have soft leather, it is lightweight and goes with just about any outfit you wear. Got it rather quickly considering it was shipped from China."
4.0,Nice shirt. Exactly as described.
4.0,No pockets ;(
4.0,"This band is thinner than the apple ones, but it works great! I was worried it would be too thin, but it was sturdy and looks good too. I was also worried that the white one would get dirty and scuffed pretty easily, but I have not noticed any issues with it."
4.0,We had a secret santa last Christmas via Elfster. My cousin listed this product and provided the link to Amazon. It was only about $17 and came on time with no problems with delivery. She loves it! Just what she wanted and expected.
4.0,Great material and style. Runs very small.
4.0,"I've only had them for 5 days, and as long as they don't stretch out later, I'm very pleased."
4.0,"These earrings are stylish, well made and the price point is amazing! I read some of the reviews saying they were small but I think their perfect, not too small and not crazy huge. They look classy and fashionable. Another reviewer said the large round ball was the front and the smaller ball the back. That is not the case with mine. That bing said, the weight of the larger ball in the back. Makes them hang perfectly. I too have very long hair and the show beautifully. The only reason I didn’t give them five stars was due to the gold colored balls. I really didn’t care for the tone, this is my personal taste. It doesn’t reflect on the earrings themselves. The silver tone with the white zirconias are my go to, love them!"
4.0,"I like it, soft, cozy but!  Too big!  I usually wear ll bean 1x but in this case just too large."
4.0,I wore this dress for my engagement party and looked beautiful next to my fiancé in his blue suit. The material is decent and it hangs nicely. I love this dress. It fit according to my normal size.
4.0,Looks pretty and is very comfortable to wear . Only suggestion is size up on size
4.0,Not as shiney as it looks but my sister-in-law loved it!
4.0,"I bought this dress for my engagement photos and have LOVED it! I'm 5'4"" and the hem came just below my knees, but not quite mid calf. I have a larger chest (34DD) but a smaller waist (30"") and after reading reviews to size up (I normally wear a 6 or 8) the size 10 was great.<br />The neckline scoops down nicely, but is still modest and doesn't show cleavage. I actually really like the material, as it's slightly heavier to block against wind, but I have never overheated in it. The buttons are real and working, and even when stretching they don't gap or show my bra underneath. The arms are fitted, but have a nice stretch to them so I never feel confined. The color is beautiful, and I get compliments on it all the time at work and church.<br /><br />The only complaint I have is when the dress arrived fresh out of the package, it had a hole in the back arm seam and the pocket wasn't quite finished with the stitching. Since I didn't have time to return it I just sewed it myself. Other than that, the dress has held up great after multiple washes. It is very hard to wrinkle, but when it does, it just steams right out. This dress is great for summer or pairs nicely with a sweater and booties for fall and winter.<br /><br />I'm the type who spends hours researching and comparing dresses, and I would wholeheartedly recommend this dress to others."
4.0,they where smaller than I was thinking of having but when I put them on they  are very comfortable I can sleep in them and with the silicone backing it like I'm not wearing any  at all.  I  have  had them in  for a week now and they are so comfortable  the backing makes it feel good not to tight also I have a rose  chain that I have ben wearing with it I'm very happy with these earrings and the price was right and it came with in days of ordering them but I still wish they where a little bigger
4.0,"Received item, thank you!!!"
4.0,"Fits nicely.  The top is easy to get in and out of.  The bottoms are rather thin, but work."
4.0,"Sleeves a little tight, but OK"
4.0,"I really like this purse, but the zipper pulls come off really easy. I lost one within the first few days if having it."
4.0,"Only reason I didn't give this 5 starts is because of the way the front neckline lays.  It's not super visible, but I do notice it.  Fabric is soft and flows very prettily!"
4.0,"Really like the design and heavy weight, however the tips fell off as soon as I took it out of the package.  Fortunately, I have super glue.  Would buy again, but would pull of the tips and re-glue before wearing.  Also, the slide is loose and I have to keep readjusting to keep the bracelet in place."
4.0,Liumilac womens teddy bear pullover. This is very comfortable to wear it is a long pullover that comes to my knees. I am 5'4 but I would consider this a dress. It is soft and slightly furry on the outside it is not lined on the inside. The cream color is pretty and this is cute with leggings. The hood is not heavy and the drawstrings are thick. Overall this would be cute with high boots or with leggings.
4.0,"Review Disclaimer: I did not receive this product at a discounted rate, nor was I asked to review the product by the seller. I am reviewing this product so others may benefit from my experience with it.<br /><br />Let me start off by saying this wallet does look pretty sweet, and I wish it was available in more colors. I've had this wallet for a year now and it shows. I attached three pictures so you could see how it wars. The bright orange isn't so bright anymore and you can see wear on the inside from where the metal clip has imprinted on the inner of the wallet as well as some of the orange fabric ripped off. I'm not dissatisfied with the purchase though. For twelve dollars I didn't expect this wallet to last a long time. It still works and it still fulfills my desire for a slim wallet that holds my bills and cards.<br /><br />I can't stand a bulky wallet and that's why I purchased this one because it looked pretty slim. I attached another photo so you could see what a &#34;full&#34; wallet looks like next to an iphone 5 with an otterbox on it.<br /><br />Pros:<br />-Stylish looks<br />-Integrated, removable money clip<br />-Plenty of pockets for cards and IDs<br /><br />Cons:<br />-Not of the highest quality and will likely show wear within a year.<br />-Sometimes the pockets stick to your cards.<br />-Money clip can damage interior of wallet or possibly cause wear on pants.<br /><br />Overall, I'd recommend this to someone who has the desire for a slim wallet and a stylish two-tone look."
4.0,The shirt is nice but the color is a little faded. I mean for the price it's ok.
4.0,"I purchased these leggings because I wanted something that was comfortable and durable when I decide to exercise. I give him four stars because in certain light you can see it my cellulite. But only a little tiny bit and they roll down just a little when you sit down. Other than that I love them, I will definitely purchase another pair again from this seller😊"
4.0,"This is nice but I'm not WOWed by any means.  This seems like a pretty standard quality blazer that you find a lot here.  Decent quality make and material.  It fits okay, and I'd say it is true to size.  I wouldn't call it flattering but it will be okay for work.  I appreciate that it is lined and has shoulder pads to help make a squared shoulder look.  Looks better after steaming it.  Just ok in my opinion."
4.0,"Order came in a reasonable amount of time. Did seem smaller, would recommend ordering a size up."
4.0,"Cute outfit, but really needs a belt and good luck finding one in little boys sizes"
4.0,It ran a bit large
4.0,"Got a size small, and it was a little tight"
4.0,Will enjoy wearing this bracelet!
4.0,"Fun and off the beaten path for casual days. Seems to be sized for wrists under 6.5&#34; in diameter. Dial is easy to read, albeit rather approximate due to lack of hour and minute markers between the 4 numbers."
4.0,"Use it for laying, don't have much compression function though."
4.0,comfy & true to size.
4.0,good grey and nice
4.0,"This little gem does what it's supposed to do.  I've gotten them for all of the women in my extended family, and they all love it, too!  The only caveat is that after a while, the part that inserts into the disc will pop out.  I just make sure it's inserted when I hang it on the table, and it works fine.  Would buy again!!"
4.0,Same exact color as the pink band that came with my watch originally<br /><br />This looks nicer on your wrist than the generic silicone band that comes with the watch<br />It’s cute but not comfortable to me..  I find myself wearing it once in a blue moon  It does feel secure on my wrist
4.0,"Cute, smaller than I was expecting but I like it"
4.0,"Scarf has those pointy edges that you see on the picture at the end, it’s not the way it falls or the way the image was taken. It measures about 70-75” by 12”<br />Color is pretty, however the pattern only runs on one side of the scarf the other side is plain, therefore you must wear it exactly as shown on the picture otherwise it looks a little strange.<br />Material is just right in thickness for winter in California, definitely for fashion and not for real warming purposes like if you live in Minnesota. It is soft and cozy. Print is Burberry like.<br />For me it was excellent, just be advised of all the details above."
4.0,"The band feels a bit thin, but holding up.  Very nice quality and I get compliments each time I wear it out."
4.0,All of my items fit except the car keys!!<br />The snap could be more secure that’s why I’m giving it 4 stars.
4.0,My grand daughter loved it. It seems well made for the price.
4.0,Perfect for my Christmas gift to my friend!! Thank you
4.0,A little large but she will grow into them. Super soft and comfy!!
4.0,The material is of good quality. Makes me feel closer to the lord when praying. would buy again if needed.
4.0,The photo is not indicative of the shirt. It's not gray. But I do like the white with blue stripes. It's a keeper. Fits perfectly.
4.0,One of my favorite pieces I've ordered so far. Yellowish color leather compliments a lot of my clothing choices.
4.0,i am in love with this onsie its by far my favorite but my button did pop off but im not sure if i did it or not
4.0,I enjoy them easier to use and I like them on my belt and not on the pants.Feels good to wear.
4.0,"The belt is cute on dress and comfortable. It worth for the price and it doesn't, look cheap at all."
4.0,Very good quality.  Buckle is good quality.  Fits as expected
4.0,I just got these today in a XL and I am a size 12. I usually like PJ's to be roomy but when I held these up they looked giant!! They are beautiful and love love love the pockets!  I am hoping when I put them on tonight they don't fit as large as they look!
4.0,"I like it, it is as I wanted."
4.0,this dress was great for the fourth- it isn't extremely high-quality but a great dress for the price. i will be wearing it for other occasions too
4.0,"nice, classic,"
4.0,Fits as described. Comfy. Light weight . Have ordered this brand for other things before and will continue to order from them. Everything so far arrives as described and on time and is usually decently priced.
4.0,These slippers are a great color. Nice and soft with a cute fuzzy dinosaur. They run a little small but my son loves them!
4.0,It is really large. But so beautiful and sparkly.
4.0,Cute but tight on the upper arm.
4.0,"I like to wear these over my glasses. They are large but light and comfortable and the vision is good, but the material is cheap. I already bought several pairs. One has a broken lens. Another one has a broken leg. The legs are held on by screws that seem different from normal glasses, so I can't really interchange them. Nevertheless, I like these better than some of the more expensive ones that i have purchased because they are lighter and more comfortable."
4.0,"As a RE Fan wanted a variation from all my Umbrella Hats, a Nice, Warm Beanie and worth 10bucks but not much more, be aware that the Tricell Logo is just Silk Screened on and not a Patch for Embroidered!!!"
4.0,Fits my glasses perfect.
4.0,"Nice,  but I just noticed that at 12 noon,  the hour hand is 7 minutes ahead.<br />and the watch gains about 3 minutes every 30 days."
4.0,"I received this waist trainer a couple of days ago and have worn it for about 6 hours over two days. While it takes time to get results in your waist size, I did notice that it gave me excellent support and improves my posture. It is a little tighter than I expected, but it is a waist trainer after all. The length is good for me (I am 5'4&#34; and I ordered the &#34;short torso&#34;), however, I wish the seller would have listed the length measurements for short vs. long so I wouldn't have had to guess. I am pleased with the quality and price of this waist trainer. My friend purchased one at the mall and we compared them. They appear to be EXACTLY the same materials, down to the trim (there are vertical pieces of black and gold lace/trim on the sides). The only difference was brand (different tag) and price. The waist trainers at our local mall sell for $80+. Overall, I am satisfied with this purchase and I can't wait to see if I get results from wearing it.<br />This product was provided at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review."
4.0,Love this necklace! Only four stars because the chain is obviously cheap. But the lava rocks are great.
4.0,That lime green color in the image is simply not accurate. But I have received several compliments on this piece and enjoy wearing it.
4.0,"I bought this modeling wax to do halloween make up at work and the wax is great, it creates really cool effects and I was able to create really nice and scary scars and wounds however the wax is a little too soft and a little bit harder to work than regular wax."
4.0,Better for shorter torso's &#60; I have to keep pulling it down for the waist to be where it should sit
4.0,"The dress is comfy but thin, not see thru but thin. I have the rust colored dress."
4.0,Bag was fine but it was just too big for my liking
4.0,"The shirt was pretty much what I expected.  It didn’t work out for my purpose, but that has nothing to do with the shirt."
4.0,They are a little on the thin side but still usable
4.0,Works good for the reason I made the purchase<br />Good quality
4.0,"This was a little small but serves the purpose.....for the cost, you can't beat this robe.  I have purchased 2 for guests to use when they visit my beach house."
4.0,They ran really big
4.0,They're a nice size. A little thinner than I wanted and the gold color is more like 18K gold color. They are a great earring for the price.
4.0,"I got these crown brooches for my daughter to give away to little girls at her pageant events. They come individually packaged on a card inside a plastic bag, but I got some cute little pink ring boxes and they fit perfectly!<br /><br />I bought (2) 12 packs. Out of the 24 brooches, 3 of them didn't have the pin secured well and 5 of them had slightly offset stones. However, the ones that were good, were STUNNING! They are so perfect for what I bought them for, I ended up buying 4 more packs the same day I recieved the first ones.<br /><br />I attached photos of the brooch in the ring box and next to my wedding ring for size comparison, along with the back of the brooch to show how the pin opens and closes."
4.0,"My 5 year old son loves these, easy to get on and off, very comfortable and look nice.,"
4.0,"I really like them, but I ordered my normal size & they are considerably smaller. I would send them back, but they will fit my daughter, so no loss, but it's aggravating......"
4.0,"I love it! But the color is not black as it show in the picture, its more like a brown-ish! Still cute though! I'm happy with it! Love the price too"
4.0,"My gf loved how soft it was, but when she tried it on the tank top fit like a sports bra. What happened there?? She also isnt a fan of the super long sleeve that cups her wrists."
4.0,"Why the bag is durable and light, it does not fit well on broad shoulders. I'm happy with the quality , but not the fit. I'll probably order some para cord to extend the straps, or I'll end up giving it to nephew."
4.0,"I love this skirt. It was for Disney night at our school dance. The dress came on time, however the stitching is poor. I had to sew the dress before I could wear it. The stitching at the zipper was poor. I had to add an extra hole in the belt. I would say it's not true to size."
4.0,"I've never owned a pair of sunglasses with reddish orange lenses but they are surprisingly attractive to wear. They are lightweight and you can tell they are not expensive by the touch of them (the frame is thin, as is the tips of the stems) but from a distance people will think you spent quite a bit on your glasses. It comes with a faux leather case which is nice but has no cleansing cloth, which I was strange. But I was surprised how well these fit, and they keep out the glare of the sun really well. They are not mirrored (you can see your eyes from the outside) but they look cool."
4.0,my grand baby love it
4.0,The dress was beautiful..the material was sheer and very comfortable. Because of the sheer fabric you will need to wear spanx or some other shapewear underneath.  I did receive many compliments!
4.0,I had to send it back. I Ordered a Medium and got and XL. Reordered it and Finally got it in the right size.
4.0,It's super pretty and cute! The only downfall is that it's not made in white gold or yellow gold! That way it would last!!!
4.0,These are just what I expected.  They were great party favors for my daughter's birthday.
4.0,"It does look like a scrunchie, but it was to big for my skinny wrist so I had to take the threads out & cut the elastic, sewed it up to make it smaller."
4.0,"I love it, the size fit, and it hasn’t lost its luster.  I would order another."
4.0,"Great price, and great quality. Bought it as a gift and he loves it."
4.0,This product ran a little small so I returned it and got the next size up which fits perfect! Lots of support and a very bright white.
4.0,"I love the color and the material! I went hiking in these and they kept me warm high in the mountains but not too hot on the 80 degree ground. However I found mine a bit large. I ordered a S/M, I am 5&#34;8 and 130 lbs, I wear a 4/5 in pants. They fit my legs in length and tightness perfectly, but the crotch area and butt was not tight enough that I had to pull them up occasionally and worry about a camel toe... If I could get a smaller size I will buy again and in more colors. I will still wear these and enjoy them around the house!"
4.0,"Very pretty. I'm planning to wear it with tights this winter, as it is a bit short. It's a nice wine color."
4.0,"just doesn't always stay on tight, find myself tightening it multiple times during the day"
4.0,Me gusto mucho es muy como y lindo queda cómo lo esperaba
4.0,Nice...little cheaply made...but for the price. Not bad
4.0,Very comfortable and I could you my phone.
4.0,It is comfortable to wear. And thick enough to be sturdy while wearing.  You can see a persons lips easily.What puzzles me is the instructions to not wash or wipe the plastic part. How could that be sanitary?
4.0,I purchased this purse for my 8 year old niece.  She really liked it.  Very pretty design.
4.0,These are fine leggings I was worried when I got them in that they were see through but now wearing them they aren’t yet. I have washed a few times and they have held up
4.0,"This is a watch for women that has a casual and sporty look. The black mesh band is adjustable. Taking it off isn't easy initially. I had to have my husband remove it so I wouldn't break my nails. The crystal is mineral, which helps prevent scratches but it can still break, just like a glass one. The face is black with gold colored hands and numerical markers. The numeral markers have crystals on all except the 6 and 12."
4.0,This fits and looks like the picture. It's a t-shirt with fringe -  simple as that. I sized up for comfort
4.0,"I found them to be a little loose. I purchased a med. I'm 5""4 140ish. But they are cute and what I was looking for just wanted them a little tighter."
4.0,"The shirt itself is really nice, looks good, the only issue is the size, I don't think the sizes are accurate. I ordered a large one but it feels and looks a bit smaller. That's why I give them 4 star"
4.0,Runs small My daughter is sad that I have to return it.
4.0,Still very comfortable but does not look like the picture. More of an overall feel . Find of rough fabric . I still wear it though so it’s not to bad
4.0,Didn't know their was pearls on em.
4.0,It works well for my 8yr old when he is playing baseball.  It is cheap enough I dont have to worry about him losing it or damaging it.
4.0,"great product, fits good"
4.0,Went well with the rose color MK watch I got my daughter for her birthday..
4.0,Okay. It doesn't lock in to the point that is most comfortable so I am constantly adjusting it depending on amount of activity I do.
4.0,the but cheeks are perfectly displayed- but the waist is a bit snug... I think the size chart was 1 size off
4.0,Bought for my mom who wanted shoes to not be too tight and to slide on easily. She has difficulty getting down and maneuvering laces. This was a good fix. Would recommend for someone in a similar situation.
4.0,"Nice material, good fit. Not see through at all."
4.0,Alttle snug in the middle but I expected that. Added a blazer and I felt awesome in the dress.
4.0,"Glad to find this item available through Amazon,  and with comprehensive sizing information as it was a gift for my wife. Fits perfectly. Only thing holding off a 5 star review was that it arrived a bit wrinkled and the collar had to be pressed."
4.0,"The white top didn’t fit around my chest, it was a little thin but the dress was nice for layering. It came with the hair ties, dress and white top."
4.0,"I am a denim dress wearer; always searching the net- looking for the next unique denim dress.  This is one! Love the fit, the fabric, the look....everything."
4.0,It turned out to be more beautiful than I even expected I'm so glad I bought it
4.0,"It feels like a stretchy, athletic fabric-  which I was expecting from other reviews. It doesn't feel like cotton or other usual sweater material and it doesn't feel particularly breathable.  It does feel comfortable and I expect it to work nicely for me when it gets colder.<br /><br />That being said, something you can't see in the seller images is how metallic the fabric is.  The grey in the blue/grey one has an okay sheen.  However, the blue and teal colored stripes are pretty metallic looking.  It was acceptable for me at lightning deal prices, but at full price, I would have returned it.  The metallic throws off the casual, athleticness of the look for me and instead of wearing it on outings, I'd more likely wear this around the house or for really casual evenings with close friends."
4.0,Nice soft inside. I wear a twelve and my feet are almost too big for the size 12 I ordered.<br />I ordered another pair in size 13 so I hope they fit better. For around the house they will do just fine.
4.0,Very narrow and the fabric was not as excepted.
4.0,Yes was just wanted very stylish thank you
4.0,"I love this. I have a dress from Urban Outfitters in red that looks similar, but I wanted another color. You can tell this is a knock off. The threads are loose and the seams aren't great but I still get loads of compliments. The only thing I don't like are the leg slits. In the more expensive one I have there is a high thigh slit. In this there are two oddly lengthens slits and they create this odd flap between your legs. I sort of want to cut them higher or sew them shut. But it is still gorgeous for the price."
4.0,It was ok I didn’t like it
4.0,"I like it's colors and shape, it's comfortable.  It's a little  large for me."
4.0,Just got mines. I like it alot
4.0,"So pretty!  I get lots of compliments!  I’m an XL and it’s still a little big on me. There is elastic on the waist. Maybe order a size down?  Depends on you.<br /><br />I thought the material would be a bit heftier, like it might be ok for winter. However, it is very thin. Still very happy that I have it."
4.0,"While the dress doesn't fit like the picture it is still really cute. I wore it to work with tights and combat boots and received a lot of compliments. It would also look cute in the summer with sandals for a more toned down look. I'm 5'5 and 200lb and bought the large. I'm also a DDD bra size. It fits very lose, but doesn't make you look big. Definitely recommend for an article of clothing that can be dressed up or down and worn casual or edgy. Do be aware that the slits on the side do go up to hit about where a pair of short shorts would, so if not being worn with leggings or tights it probably should be worn with shorts."
4.0,Great looking and nice piece. It would be so much better if it had a guide or manual to help with sizing and serting the watch.
4.0,It looked too small however when I tried it on it fit great.
4.0,Hard to find dresses to fit as I have gained weight around the middle but have had a double mastectomy. This brand always fits great and is perfect for quick dressing up in this Florida weather
4.0,A little loose but looks pretty wasnt exactly same as the picture but still really pretty
4.0,I’ve bought two of these suits the first was a yellow two weeks later I bought the white one. The yellow one fits better and their the same size. I’m thinking of getting a red one but I’m not sure if it will fit too small. Will send an update.
4.0,"My husband normally wears an XL sweatshirt.. This fit him more like a 2XL.. The front pocket cuts through the HAWKEYES as you can see in the photo.. Side Note: It smelled like vinegar when we got it, I'm sure a few more washes will take care of it.. Still keeping it as he says it's comfy!"
4.0,I have a really small waist got the small and it fits perfect
4.0,"Great quality! The button broke, but it was easy enough to replace. My daughter had fun wearing this for Halloween."
4.0,Just a bit too long for a size Small for people under height of 5''6
4.0,"Very nice outfit... zipper a little difficult but once you get evey thing in place, it zipped up fine"
4.0,This cuff is simple and solid but malleable enough to fit to your ear. it looks like it is slightly better quality in the picture than in reality but certainly worth the amount i paid for it.
4.0,"Loved the dress, but was a little big. I have a smaller waste and a bigger chest so I tend to look at the measurements and decide what size I should get. I got a medium this time but was baggy almost everywhere, but it is adjustable which is why I was comfortable getting the medium. My only issue now is that the sleeves are a little long so the bell sleeve falls at a weird angle but I fixed that with a small cut with a pair a scissors and some needle and thread. The hood looked a little off some how but I made a cut there and now it looks exactly like how I wanted. It was a little itchy so just watch it first and you should be fine. It looks great with a corset and some gothic jewelry. Would recommend"
4.0,Perfect for what I wanted .
4.0,Shirts were a little thinner than what I wanted but was still happy with them. Shirts are true to size
4.0,"Great dress, fits true to size ( I'm an 8/10 ordered a med and fits great). Only complaint is the belt/ribbon that ties around ya was alittle short ( doesn't leave ya much room for a nice bow."
4.0,"This is an adorable sweater but light weight enough to wear this summer.  You'll want to consider ordering a size smaller for your child, it's long but, that would make it cute worn as a dress with a pair of leggings or tights.  It's really well made and a very pretty shade of pink.  I love the style and would make a great addition to any child's wardrobe."
4.0,This watch is nice but a little hard to read. Keeps good time and a good price. It's very comfortable.
4.0,These brushes are well made for the price. They’re not my favorite but I think that’s beacause I’m still adjusting to the different shape and how to use them.
4.0,Very pleased. Going to give as a graduation gift
4.0,"Great costume! I used it for Halloween and it got lots of compliments! I’ll recommend really looking at the measurements they provide in the description. I’m 5’4” and 136lbs and usually float between a small and medium in most things, but after checking myself against the measurements, I opted to order the large, which ended up being the right call. It was a tad big in the waist, but I was able to cinch that up with the red belt and no one knew the wiser. Very, VERY happy with this purchase!"
4.0,I like the shape of the dress but it goes up your thigh a little high so make sure you wear good undergarments or stockings/tights.
4.0,"Nice shirt, thin, fits over a tank top"
4.0,Loved this dress. Very comfortable. My only thing was that it was a little too big. Definitely recommend wearing a slip underneath. The cut showed my bra slightly when sitting down! Would definitely buy another in a different color though!
4.0,"My daughter had to order a size larger and these fit fine now.  She is very happy with these although I notice after wearing them for a full day her feet are tired, not really painful.  I'm pretty sure the arches aren't giving her enough support, but she's young and can manage shoes that are a little less supportive."
4.0,"These are really well made, very sturdy, and VERY LARGE.  They are really pretty and trendy - love the shape.  They do a good job of helping reduce the sun when wearing them.  I love that they came with a soft case. Great item!"
4.0,This dress is precious!!! Please be aware that it runs small.  My daughter wears a 5T or 4/5 in girls.... I ordered her the 6T and it’s a tad short and I’m pretty sure will be too small for her by the time summer rolls around.  So order up.  It’s really cute though.
4.0,These Jeans look exactly like the picture! they do run a bit small so I would recommend getting a size bigger my only complaint is that the button for the jeans feels like its going to come off as it is hanging on by a string. Overall great jeans
4.0,I bought the medium because I would like to think I have an average sized head.  The hat is too big for my head.  I still wear it but it constantly flies off in the wind!  I like how it is quick dry  and easy to wash though.
4.0,Love the sweatshirt very comfy but runs small
4.0,Simple wallet for the Disney lover in all of us.. Two sides and a change zipper inside .. Light weight and very cute
4.0,Fitting is small...
4.0,"These are really cute, but mine are much wider in the white part than the brown and scale down opposite from the photo. They're a bit big on my calfs overall, but with boots that go high on the calf they should be perfect."
4.0,"Watch is ok. Looks good, keeps good time. It takes a while to get used to the offset hour/minute hands, but overall im happy with this watch for the price. The case's metal seems a little softer than other watches. Hopefully it doesn't scratch up badly too quickly. The band is thick which I love. Dial has a little glare issue with reflection, but its not too bothersome. Every once and a while the watch catches my eye and I do a double take. I wear it without worry of damage as it was only $40 and the watch is pretty sturdy.  Oh, it's definitely not a tourbillion or a moon phase. It's an am/pm indicator with a balance wheel on the escapement.  A true tourbillion actually rotates on multiple axis' to keep the escapement and balance wheel level to the ground regardless of the position of the watch.  This is done to counter act the effects of gravity on the escapement and keep more accurate time."
4.0,So far the sight works well.
4.0,"Granddaughters delighted with the addition of a chefs hat!  Used all the time.  6-10 yes., fits well."
4.0,"My daughter typically wears a 3T; however, after reading the other reviews about it running small I got her the 4/6 and it fits perfectly. It's well made and comfortable."
4.0,Very Comfortable Shoes
4.0,Like the bras. I just wish that they were made without having to remove pads. Makes laundry a little difficult
4.0,They don't smell after being wet from shower in gym bag thank you for that! Husband wears them and no complaints so good item.price was good. I went by other reviews for sizing.
4.0,"Nice warm soft socks with a sticky tread, Very Nice"
4.0,I loved these gloves until I got a hole in one finger from a fork while washing dishes. Very disappointed
4.0,"My son loves Roblox. These are nice because you can adjust the nose and the ears to fit better, and I like that they come with filters. The only reason I didn't get of it five stars is they are a little big for a child's face but otherwise they are very nice."
4.0,I really like the jeans. I got a size 14 but it is a little to big in the crotch. I will buy a size 10 and see how that works out.
4.0,Very pretty.  I had a problem with the product and the seller was excellent in replacing the flip flops.
4.0,I tad small for the size
4.0,"Stretchy, comfortable & and light feeling."
4.0,The sleeves are a bit long.  I have to turn them over at the wrists.  But other then that I like the sweater.
4.0,Loved the headpiece but had to use my own straps for the arm bands.  They need to be made our of elastic.
4.0,"These are heavier than I expected.  They are hotter to wear than other masks I have.  They are made well, but just know they will keep your face very warm."
4.0,"Fits very cute.  Little itchy but nothing too uncomfortable, and I hate itchy clothes!"
4.0,Beautifully made. Soft durable material. The only drawback is the horribly itchy tag in the side of the shirt. My suggestion: go tagless!
4.0,I like it because it is so soft. Gave it 4 stars because it shades and I am still to figure out how to ware it without all the &#34;hair&#34; staying on my clothes.
4.0,"I read the reviews and saw it ran small, but I love this outfit for my boy!!"
4.0,They look great but are a little flimsy.
4.0,"I love the shorts they are the perfect fit, but the top is a little bit big for me."
4.0,A great sun hat.
4.0,My kid bought this to give to her best friend. They love wearing them.
4.0,"Soooo sheer.  Thankfully, I read the reviews and knew that they were too sheer to be worn without something over the top or underneath.  I have a swim tunic that comes down over my behind, so I just needed something to come to my knees under it.  Still, I wore a tankini bottom under it because it is see-through and I didn't want to risk my long shirt coming up in the water and exposing too much.  Overall very comfortable, just very thin."
4.0,Cute and stylish. Can easily fall apart.
4.0,Great quality! Purchased this for an Alice in Wonderland cosplay and it worked great! Kids loved it as well! Only complaint is that its not 100% cotton as I understood it to be by the description.
4.0,"I got my regular size large. Fit fine. Size up for baggy at waist.  I like mine only problem was the band in the shorts, at your waist, twists in side fabric after 1 wash. Very cute though!"
4.0,Looks great on my friend she liked it very much but did say it was very heavy as far as skirts go.
4.0,Yellow box shoes are always comfortable. These are really cute. The only problem is I keep twisting my ankle in them. I don’t really think that’s a problem with this you though just my ankles 🙄.
4.0,Love this top!!! Fits true to size. I am approx 145 pounds 5’6” I got a medium fits perfectly.
4.0,This dress was beautiful but unfortunately even the small hung on my.
4.0,"Got a size small, usually need a small top, and medium bottoms. The bottoms fit but I could use a medium in bottoms for better coverage. I love it though, it's so pretty and love the removal straps on the top."
4.0,Light sweater style . Not bad for the price. Kinda runs small but over all ok!
4.0,"Great product! Thought it was going to br tighter in the waist, but still does it's job."
4.0,"First, there is no drawstring. After that, everything else is great about these pajamas. I washed them when I got them and they were still extremely soft to wear. They are warm as well, but I keep my AC in the winter and have no problems feeling to hot throughout the night."
4.0,"Cute patterns.  Super comfortable, mostly cotton blend.  Interesting that it comes from the U.K. but the label indicates &#34;made in China&#34;.  Our world trade gives us variety!!"
4.0,this is the 'british flag' belt buckle that you want. i am merely saving 'the fifth star' for extraordinary satisfaction.<br />it was shipped promptly and that is why i use amazon; it also came very well protected in a cute little cellophane envelope.<br />this 'british flag' buckle is exactly the same colour as pictured; and of a very high quality (the enameling is great) i was glad i ordered this item from 'Expressions4me'.<br />also the price was good (as i am a notorious 'tightwad') so i can easily recommend it.
4.0,"I have worked in jewelry sales for quite some time and at numerous jewelry stores so I am quite the critic. I honestly wasn't sure to give a 3 star rating or a 4 but I gave a 4 star due to prompt shipping and fast customer service when it came to questions I had.<br /><br />I got this set to replace mine temporarily while it was shipped out and had diamonds replaced. At quick glance the ring looks very real, even maybe moreso than a quick glance to those who haven't worked in a jewelry store.<br /><br />The shadow band that comes with the ring fits perfectly with the engagement ring itself. The milgrain beading helps add to the realistic look of the ring... Making it look more expensive with intricate detailing.<br /><br />Upon closer inspection, the filigree scrolls and detailing on the sides of the bands don't look extremely realistic which is okay because you usually see the ring from the top.<br /><br />Also, the center stone on my ring is set crooked in the prongs, slightly slanted, which no jeweler would ever do with a ""real"" center stone that large. But that is just me being nit picky after having taken gemology courses.<br /><br />As far as looking real in terms of the size of the center stone, it definitely can pass as real. It is not too large or too small, nor gaudy.<br /><br />I will update my review after some wear to update on how it holds up!"
4.0,They’re really nice I loved them. I just wished they had smaller bracelets cause it fit me big because I have small wrists
4.0,I have a big nose and it doesn’t fit well. Constantly moves up or off the nose while talking.
4.0,"Great quality bra, but I'm super picky so it didnt work for me. I dont like any squishing or touching and this squished."
4.0,Good quilty for the $$
4.0,Came just as expected. Unfortunately was easy to rip the seam on the shoulder.
4.0,Helps keep my feet warm. Not a whole lot. Comfortable. A good buy though.
4.0,"Super cute on, maybe a little short, definitely needs shorts underneath."
4.0,"I own about 15 ax paris dresses (love this brand!) and am consistently a size 12, but this dress is a looser fit. Returned for a size 10."
4.0,"They are a little short, like some people described. And the material is like that of a swimsuit. But they fit great, I ordered a 2x and they fit like a 2x. And they're super cute!! I wear them under other shirts so the shortness of it doesn't bother me."
4.0,"Well made, stitching gives the band a casual look perfect for my Mickey Safari watch. Four pins and a tool were included."
4.0,they had a good product for the price paid.  they fit well and work great with most of my flats.
4.0,"Really great jacket. Just wished I had ordered a size smaller, quite long on a 5ft 2 lady. It was a gift and she wants to keep it vs. exchanging. Quality is excellent."
4.0,"Gloves arrived fine, however there were one missing from the package. Only received 23 of 24 gloves (11-1/2 pairs)."
4.0,the sword is awesome but without a stand idk where tf to put it without it being hard to see i had a plan if it had a stand but now i just keep propping it on things it eventually falls off so its sitting on the counter i think i found a miny stand but it not guess my real katana got a new 1
4.0,I chose this rating because these nose studs are durable and come in a variety of colors for everyday change
4.0,"Really tight so it creates a bulge, so size up in the band. It is stretchy & band is wide so I’ll keep it & see how it goes."
4.0,"This was sent directly to a friend as a gift.  I did not see the product first hand.  So, I cannot comment on the quality of the products.  My friend said she liked the items."
4.0,I couldn't wear it allergic to metal.
4.0,Came fast and looks gorgeous.
4.0,True to size. Light weight and comfortable. Wish the sleeves were a touch longer. The solid area is a bit see through
4.0,Love them. Great value and compare to glasses that cost hundreds.
4.0,the design.  very cute great fit.
4.0,"Received on the promised delivery date. Was packaged well and secure. The watch is great...a definite conversation piece! The band is a little stiff and the secure straps do not stay in place, so the end of the band was constantly sticking out. I may eventually swap the band for a leather one. Other than that, I love it!"
4.0,"very comfy. crotch does sag, and came with a small hole though, I easily fixed the hole with iron on patch on inner seem and worked great."
4.0,"I like it too mush , its really soft and practical , i guess they need to work to change the size measurements little bit"
4.0,Really cute dress! It’s icntedibly cheap material. WAY cheaper than I was anticipating. But it’s sits well and is very comfortable. It runs HUGE! I normally wear an XL but bought a L and it’s still HUGE! Definitely a cute dress though. Perfect for summer
4.0,"Got this for my son for Christmas. Although I wasn't very happy with how bulky and big the actual charm is, my son loves it. He wears it everyday. It was one of his favorite gifts. Made very well."
4.0,"Genine Women's Jegging's are quite comfortable. What I love most about these jegging's is that they have the warm fleece lining within them. The only reason that Genine Women's Jegging's  are receiving four out of five stars is because the lighter colored of the pair fit tighter/smaller. I mean they still fit, but not as form fitting and comfortable as the dark ones. Besides that. These Jegging's are great to wear out and about. They are also more along the line of yoga pants jegging's then jean jegging's but I have had many complement's on how good they look. So over all I am satisfied with My purchase, even if one of the pairs does not fight as expected. In closing these jegging's are comfortable, they work well to where you can twist and turn without them falling off, and they stay in place, and are warm."
4.0,"I have not had to wear this yet because it's been dry but will update this when I've had a chance to wear it.<br /><br />For sizing, I'm 5'10, about 160#, normal torso/dimensions, no belly, and ordered the Large. With just a thin cycling jersey on, I feel like the large is too large. If I had something more substantial on underneath, I think the fit would be better. Am considering getting a M as I don't care for things that are too loose. This one is right on the cusp for me... what I do like about the large is that if I wanted to roll the sleeves up, I can do that without fear of my hands turning purple and falling off. The medium might get a little tight in that application."
4.0,"It's reasonably priced I really like the way it looks, and it goes really well with the FreeKey system, but it also scratches very easily."
4.0,The glasses arrived promptly and are light weight.
4.0,"I liked the dress and the stretch fabric was appreciated, but it was sadly ill-fitting despite my sizing up. I am 6'0 and while the length was fine, the elastic waist fell right under my bust and the sleeves were at about my wrist bones, I couldn't pass the sleeves off as 3/4 length as tall women often have to. Ultimately, I gave it to a short friend that loved it."
4.0,Not subtle but cute. Best feature is the adjustable chain.
4.0,"A bit heavier than I thought it would be, but still comfy and works for work when paired with leggings and the right shoes."
4.0,Fits fine but not as warm as thought it would be doesn't go over my ears at all color is excelkent
4.0,It's cute but the pants seem to run small
4.0,"comfortable dress, however when you put on and take off the sequins do tend to come off a bit, but overall  cute dress I'm using it for a thanksgiving great Gatsby theme dinner theme and a black Friday dinner mardi gra theme just changing accessories.  I will also then use it for xmas eve dinner. so over all worth the price"
4.0,I love the adjustable size however the magnet latch Gravitates to many things throughout the day that I come in contact with.
4.0,"I love all six of my Anysize dresses, but I'm knocking one start off of this one because it HAS NO POCKETS. That is a feature in the others that I most appreciate, so I was disappointed to find that this one doesn't have any. However, I have NO intention of returning it because it is otherwise perfect."
4.0,"Bought an L, got an L.  Smaller than an XL, but fits larger than the rest of my L's/  Its super comfy though."
4.0,"So, why this got a 4 and not a 5...The collar isn't really a collar.  It's not going to give much protection if zipper all the way up and you're cold.  Also, when zipped, it lays kind of funny.<br /><br />On the size - I'm a size 34-27-37.5  Typically I buy a small and did so in this.  While the small fits and I don't feel poured into it, I do wish I would've bought a medium only because I like my shirts a little roomier when I'm running.  Also, the material, while very comfortable, isn't quit a stretchy as I thought, probably adding to why I think medium would've been perfect for me.<br /><br />I will still wear this and run in it - it will work for my 3-5 normal runs but not my 10+ mile marathon training runs - I'm just noting my preferences.<br /><br />Also for those running in cold...I feel like I could get away with running in this and only this as long as the windchill doesn't dip much below 30 degrees.  There's a soft, fleece-like material on the inside that seems like it will help hold in heat when it gets really cold."
4.0,"Very pretty & well made, it just didn’t fit me well."
4.0,Nice well made alternative to the $100+ Oakley sunglasses.
4.0,Nice quality. Very versatile piece of gear. Fun patterns! [[ASIN:B01LE3H5VI INTO THE AM Black Camo Cats Seamless Mask Bandana]]
4.0,this dress fits me perfect.
4.0,These are good quality scarves for the price. The zebra print is very silky!! I got these as a gift for my mother and my sister for Christmas and they loved them!
4.0,"It's a great hat, just a bit larger than expected."
4.0,"I used a lot of Isaac lieve products. But for all of them, there’s one issue that it tears off after a little use. Till now my 5/6 cover up cardigan got torn."
4.0,Perfect blazer for work. It’s nice and light weight. I live in Florida and I have to dress professionally for work and it is very hot here. This blazer is comfy and light.<br />Great price and great fit!
4.0,"The liner for the shorts were great!! The outer shorts were waaaaaay too big, they made my butt look huge because of the elastic in the back of the shorts, I ordered a large, I have a 33-34 inch waste. They are very well made and minus my butt looking enormous, I love them, if I ever get my refund I'll order the same shorts in a medium. I've been waiting for a week on my refund using amazon locker"
4.0,Love this jacket! It fits so well and it well made too!<br />The jacket did come with a strong odor but I sprayed it down with fabric spray and hung it up outside to dry. It (thank goodness) did the trick!
4.0,"Really a beautiful dress, I tried it on and it seemed to fit but then seemed a little smaller after washing, it's a beautiful pattern & material is soft"
4.0,Están cómodos pero para ejercicio no lo son tanto. Buena calidad y excelente ajuste.
4.0,I really like it once I got it on it looks pretty but it took a little while to get it screwed in which was really annoying but once I got it done it looked good!
4.0,"Well constructed.  Not quite as cute as I thought, but I wanted a silver tone necklace. I have worn it once and it did the trick."
4.0,Some of the crystals were mixed up and I had to take a few hours to separate them where they’re meant to go.
4.0,One of the faces of the cuff links isn’t attached. Again not an expensive item. But frustrating that I have to fix it and hope it doesn’t come off day of
4.0,The shirt ran a bit large but had a nice weight to it and was of good quality.
4.0,"It is so cute but larger than sized after measuring my wrist so I gave it away, purchased with discount so looking for deal again to reorder"
4.0,"This watch is interesting and fun, and definitely a statement piece.  The windmill part is colorful and spins around (sometimes a bit distracting of course.)  The numbers are swirly and whimsical.  The watch is good quality and well-made.  It comes in a gift box and definitely would make a nice gift."
4.0,"I had my doubts...<br />My workplace is VERY dry and I get shocked hundreds of times a day. I've developed a PTSD to touching any door handle because of it and flinch and slap at door knobs before opening doors. I kinda just threw a hail marry and ordered one of these things expecting nothing... but it actually works. The light actually lights up and the static is just gone.<br /><br />My only complaint is that the build quality isn't too great. I had it on my keys and was taking it out of my pocket about a hundred times a day to get rid of static. It lasted about 3 weeks until the chain broke. I fixed the chain, but then the bottom portion of it just came off, exposing the inside lightbulb. Ended up buying another one anyway because of how much I love this thing, but wish it was made a little stronger."
4.0,I’ve got them as advertised size was perfect
4.0,"Outfit is absolutely adorable and the fact that it's not white worked out great for my daughters 1st birthday party. Only complaint I have is the bows on the leggings are only attached with glue and came off in the washing machine on gentle cycle. Otherwise, great buy and very cute!"
4.0,"Very nice case, holds glasses very secure, only problem is the glue is coming off the bottom panel slightly, a tiny drop of gorilla glue fixed it."
4.0,"Well my experience with these was different than a lot of the reviews I read..  it seemed like many people found these to fit small, I found them to fit large.  At least in the band.. I am a 36C, possibly a D and ordered a 36D because of the reviews.  I considered ordering a 38D but sure glad I didn't!!  The cup fits perfectly but the band is way long for a 36!  It fits perfect on the tightest hook but I'd like to have some room in case it stretches, cause bands usually do..  The other thing that I don't like about these bras is the straps are placed pretty wide.. they dig into my shoulders by my armpits.. I often have this problem with bras.. I have broad shoulders so maye that's why, or maybe just a lot of shoulder fat..  Maybe a 34D would be better in that departmental.  Otherwise they seem to be well made no hanging strings, colors are as pictured (I got the #60), and relatively itch free.  Such a great deal and so cute!"
4.0,"Shoe polishers were to small for the price, good if you use it 2 month"
4.0,Quality was less than I wanted but still received compliments.
4.0,"Wig came with multiple hair nets in different colors and types. Wig was really soft and you could gently brush it to make it smooth. It looks best with a hat on, as the hair line looks like a wig, but for $20 its an awesome costume wig. Made for a great Kim K halloween costume. There an elastic clasp that clasps behind your lower skull to keep in secure."
4.0,Beautiful dress with beautiful detailing!  The lace up back is also helpful for size adjustments!
4.0,"I really like this replacement strap for my Gear S2. The color was a little brighter than the picture but its still red so I really have no complaints. I am a woman and I have a small wrist. When using the original straps I use the small as its a better fit. This band is definitely bigger and sticks out some on the end. When I went on my run it continued to slip out of the securing piece on the strap. I took one star off only because I wish they would also make small straps for us females with smaller wrists. I saw a lot of reviews that state its tough to take the straps off once its on. I didn't have that issue at all. There are youtube videos on how to take off Gear S2 straps. I did so when I first bought my Gear S2. Therefore, I had no issue with this replacement band putting it on or taking it off."
4.0,YASSSSS~~
4.0,"I love the fabric and stretchy lace. It's a little low at the back but I have just the black bra with a low back also. It also fits smaller. I normally wear a size M but I ordered XL and it fits perfect. It hits a couple of inches below my knees, I'm 5'3 & 135 lbs.I like it so I'm keeping it, just make sure to buy a size or two bigger if you're buying it here."
4.0,Love this piece love fiddling with it the class kind of pokes you in the back of the neck though that's the sucky part but otherwise lots of compliments love it.
4.0,Just a wee bit tight
4.0,Needed to buy separate insoles but great value for the price! Hubby wore them hiking in Kauai and no complaints
4.0,Great fabric. Washes nicely. The pants are ridiculously long.
4.0,"Very pretty and sparkly earrings. Great size as well. The only thing I would change is the packaging, they came in a cute box however they were packaged In separate baggies. I was giving as a gift so it would have been nice if the earrings were displayed In the box"
4.0,The top fits reasonably well. A little on the big side. Very comfortable. Material soft. Colour disappointing. It was more vibrant in the picture.
4.0,"The dress is slightly large, but that works better than being too small.  I love the sunflowers and cheer I feel in the dress.  Easy to wash and hang dry."
4.0,Great product and very comfortable.
4.0,"Very pretty, but smaller then i expected.  Will fit small pearls (my intended use for purchase) but pretty snugly.  Will look for a little larger size next time. These will be great for charm bracelets , and they look very nice."
4.0,"I love these earrings. I get a lot of compliments! The longer deathly hallows ones got caught in my hair so I ended up changing them out, but they're really cute!"
4.0,size down heavy material that snugs you rightly no bra needed the girls was held however the starts do slip and you can wear a shaper as well for added  support
4.0,"I loved the clutch, however, I found it opened up a few times when I was wearing it, this was concerning"
4.0,"So far it's been a good watch. I've only had it a few days. I do not like the watch band so probably will get another one for it. The band it's self is very stiff and kind of cheap. But for the price, I can't complain.<br />If I have any problems with it, I'll update."
4.0,"Nice tongue rings good quality. I wouldnt necessarily pick out the designs i recieved if i was in a store, but for the price i dont mind."
4.0,has a problema whith beeds falling all the time.
4.0,"Super beautiful and as pictured, but after a few days the stones came off"
4.0,"It's a great backpack, lightweight and holds a lot of stuff. It arrived VERY quickly, and is very convenient. I wish the zipper had some overlapping fabric to protect from weather, but overall I am very satisfied with my purchase."
4.0,Great jacket. Thicker than thought. Will keep you warm in cool weather. Not for cold weather
4.0,"Not like my old ones, but still good."
4.0,Its thin but I really like it. Its nice.  No problems.
4.0,This is very large and boxy but I wear mine with a belt and looks very cute.<br />Quirky I think.<br />Really light fabric. Super for very hot days.
4.0,A little long for my 3 year old
4.0,"Great bag, jas lots of pockets on the ouside... but needs some on the inside!"
4.0,"Love how they feel on my feet and they look great as well. My only complaint is that after wearing them a couple of hours daily after work or after a bath before bed they have began to look very worn. Not on the bottom (that appears to be holding up well) but the actual part that touches the bottom of your feet. It does not make them less comfortable, you can just tell the material is worn down. However, for the price, I guess that's pretty good."
4.0,I like the stone they choose for me but maybe had wished it was alittle more darker blue. But I still like it regardless. Thank you for the prompt service in sending it to me.
4.0,My finger is indeed a little green but I still adore this ring.
4.0,a bit on the larger size. But I should be able to wear it.
4.0,After careful review of similar products I chose this bag. Shipping was quick and overall quality is good. Only thing I am missing is inside pockets with zipper. It would have been also good to have a leather strap piece in belt to hold a bag nicely on shoulder. Note that the bag doesn't come as shiny as it's in picture.
4.0,"The writing was a little small and hard to read, but it was pretty"
4.0,"I ordered these leggings in a size small, as I usually wear small or extra small in leggings. I am about 125 lbs and 5'5"". While these did fit, they took quite some time getting on. I teach yoga and thought that these would be perfect for yoga in the colder months. The material is super comfy but not thick in the areas that they need to be. You can totally see right through them. These would be better suited with a long sweater or long yoga top. Otherwise, I cannot wear these to yoga, let alone in public. I may just wear these around the house or invest some longer tops to wear with these. I'm so sad because I thought I was going to love these more than I did. I've been searching for a ripped hole style type legging for a while and these just aren't it for me, sadly. The hunt is still on!"
4.0,I really like this bag. I don't need pockets as I have separate smaller bags that I use for organizing.  I love the size and the wine color. I hope the strap is made well and doesn't break. If the strap stays put I will give it 5 stars.
4.0,"Foot slides a bit but that's my sizing error, I believe. I estimated and in a couple of weeks should be perfect. Easy on and off!!"
4.0,"It is two layers of cotton fabric, but it's not very thick. I have decided to wear it over a paper mask. It is comfortable and easy to put on and off. The ear pieces are adjustable with a little rubber stopper to fit your ears."
4.0,"Good quality for the price, strong zipper very detailed."
4.0,The skirt is exactly as advertised.  It fits great and is very comfortable.  I would love to have more like it.
4.0,"T-shirt material dress, I purchased for a formal event but decided to keep it even though it is not satin and not dressy looking. It is more of a T-shirt type material but it is still a great fit and I really like the dress.  You might be able to dress it up for a wedding if you wear a nice necklace. Worth the $."
4.0,Me gustó mucho y el color que adquirí me favoreció mucho
4.0,Hard to find socks that go high enough bought the extra large size sock fit perfect
4.0,"Very comfortable and flowy. I bought a large, thinking it would fit smaller, but it’s a definite large. I will still wear it and feel beautiful"
4.0,"For some reason I can't find cute rompers in store. I like this one, but it runs small. I would suggest getting one size up. The material isn't the greatest and should probably be washed with delicates."
4.0,These braids are very sexy
4.0,Work great but no built in bra...
4.0,Lays super cute but was abbot too small for me
4.0,"Very pretty, I love wearing it."
4.0,"I like this belt a lot. Easy to make this cute bow detail, but isn't quite long enough for me to do this on my body. I still wear it only with 1/2 a bow complete. Still looks really cute, but I don't think the manufacturer took into consideration people who are not size 4."
4.0,"So far good. Keep feet warm. Liked the price and availability. Ordered 1 size larger, and it was a perfect fit."
4.0,These chokers are all super cute and I really like them.<br />They all fit around my neck perfects and are able to be adjusted which is amazing!<br />The only downside to these chokers is the clasps are somewhat quite difficult to get open so that I could put each choker on.<br />I would recommend these chokers as long as you are able to open the clasps.
4.0,"I like the shoes a lot, for this price especially) they look chic and classy, i also love the color.<br /><br />Upd: i just realized the color of both shoes are not the same! One is more shiny, kinda snake skin, the other one is more matt. Thats weird, but i dont want to bother with the return 🤷🏼‍♀️"
4.0,My waist is not small by any means and I tightened the size small to be tighter. I'm 155 lbs and 5'5. But the quality is very nice for the price- the clasp looks much more expensive. May not last forever but will do for now.
4.0,"nice hat, just wish the eagle was a little bigger"
4.0,Look nice with all my shoes.
4.0,"This bag is sturdy with plenty of room to pack most needs for dance class,would have liked one more separate pocket for dance shoes instead of just the one extention,however for the price point it is quite good."
4.0,The watch looks more than what it is. Has a Chinese Rolex looks to it.  Surprisingly I have gotten a lot of complements on it at work. It arrived with a small scratch on the bezel by the number 50 still deciding whether I would return it for that. The only thing I do not like is the band. Its not uncomfortable but I just can't get used to it. Other customers may not mind. I will be adding a rubber strap to it for the watch looks very nice but the strap just makes it look flimsy. I thing a nice rubber strap would make it look more &#34;tough&#34;. Overall for $23 bucks you can't beat it. I use it for work and it has received a beating. So far so good. If it breaks who cares for the price you can get another one.
4.0,Warm and not too heavy.
4.0,I'm 5'4 and 117 lbs. I read reviews saying to order a size up. I normally get a small so I got a medium. It fits comfortably. Not baggy but not skin tight either. Material is smooth. Pattern is not as vivid in real life as it is in the pic but still looks good
4.0,"Looked good, folded up well. Was hoping that they would be small and sleek to fit in front pants pocket, but once they're in the case it's a bit bulky to keep in a pocket all the time.  When unfolded they didn't seem to sit level on a table, but that may be a result of the way they are made to fold up."
4.0,"This is overall a cute sweatshirt! I am 5'2, 160 and the XL fits like a regular long sleeve t-shirt. I'm glad I went with the XL it fits just nicely. I was expecting the material inside to be a little softer than it is, but it doesn't bother me."
4.0,"Watch band arrived, product was darker in person then the photo online showed, but not a deal breaker. Everything else as described."
4.0,"Nice bag to take back and forth to work. Many pockets, varying in size. Its pretty large. Didn't think it was this big/ But I can fit alot in it."
4.0,Perfect as a layering piece.
4.0,Super comfy and can be dressed up or go more casual and look great both ways
4.0,"As other reviewers have mentioned, this is a very small shrug.  I bought it for wearing over tank tops in the summer so it could say, &#34;I'm not wearing a tank top&#34;  HA!  I am only 5 ft tall, about 125 lbs, 36  inch bust, petite frame.  It fits me fine for just a little cover up at work over a tank.  It covers the boobs enough to be acceptable.  The color is nice, it leans a bit toward the yellow side of beige.  I  like it.  Hope this info helps."
4.0,This product is great for carrying my extra power adapters and phone chargers. This thing can pretty much hold anything. I was surprised at how many items I could squeeze into this thing. Elastic is holding very well..... for now. Really sturdy and great design. I gave it four stars because it didnt have enough long bands to hold larger items. But all in all the quality is great and I found it to be very useful.
4.0,"The color on the dress was exactly like the picture (red). The dress feels soft and comfortable. Unfortunately, the dress was a little too big on me on the shoulders."
4.0,Smaller than I thought but good for everyday placeholder earrings. I never take them out unless I’m putting on dressier ones. Comfortable and they don’t get caught on my hair like some hoops do.
4.0,It's what I'm looking for but in a smaller scale. I want it for my front pocket.
4.0,"works well. great price. the website shows 3 modes based on the color, red high, blue medium, white low however on mine theres red, blue, green. the red is high and feels great when working outside."
4.0,"I love how sturdy this belt it, and the buckle is very easy to use.  Only downside is that there isn't much room to grow. Order a bigger size than you may need."
4.0,"These were a lot smaller than I anticipated. I also found them a little tricky to put in. I even dropped one and lost it completely. Right down the drain. Which is fine with me, none of my earrings match, and I like it that way. They're very dainty. Quite pretty."
4.0,Nice looking costume although my daughter claims the sleeve material was itchy.  I ordered an extra small that fit my tall yet very slim 10 year old quite well.  I'd say the cut is bit on the narrow side though.
4.0,I like this dress. Flattering. Shows my tummy more than i would like :-)<br />Overall Supercute!!! Would buy again.
4.0,The decal was a little distressed.  It looks like that is intentional.  But I didn't realise that when I ordered it.  He still loved it.  Fits nice and food quality.
4.0,Gorgeous colors and so soft. For sizing purposes I measure 40.5” around hips. Only 4 stars because a few of them ride up and bunch in my crack. That’s not very comfortable. I didn’t notice that on all of them.
4.0,Cute Christmas outfit for Florida.
4.0,A bit larger than others we have bought.  But great on not slipping and yet not sticking in her hair.
4.0,Great as gifts for the younger people
4.0,When I didnt want to wear a mask these face shields are perfect cover.  they can be worn around the neck until needed.  The instructions on how to use them as other things like skull caps etc is not easy to understand.  Glad I bought them though
4.0,The grip is not as good as I hoped but they work.
4.0,He keeps asking if I ordered this for the Grandson it has a very small band and cheap made
4.0,"I really liked this scarf. At first it had a very bad odor, but after a couple of days it all left and it is fine now."
4.0,"I liked the bracelet. The words on the green pieces were extremely hard to read. I think the price was too high. $12 -$15.00 would be more reasonable. Item arrived on time and was in a gift box, which I appreciated."
4.0,"This is a very sexy piece! It looks great and I feel great in it. However, I do not feel like I have a long torso, but the piece felt a little short. It is still pretty comfortable to wear (for lingerie)."
4.0,El vestido es lindo pero no me gusto el material.
4.0,So comfy looks great
4.0,"Beautiful, but was a little smaller than expected. Normally large fits me loose, this is a little tight across my hips looks very lovely as a long blouse.<br />I'm 5'4 and its too short to use as a dress for casual wear,  looks super cute with shorts, or leggings. Fabric is NOT cotton I wear a thin cotton t-shirt under it or I would get sweaty pits<br />because of the poly like blend.....<br />I do like it alot even tho its not cotton and want it to last so planning on washing by hand. It seems delicate."
4.0,"I wear skorts when I ride my ElliptiGO. I like hi-viz colors so I’m seen in the road. This skirt has great color. I have several Colorado Clothing skorts as well as a couple Dona Jo skorts. The Icyzone is made of lighter weight fabric than the other two brands, but it fits similarly to the Colorado brand. I was very happy with the Icyzone skirt. 5’9” 145 lbs, size M."
4.0,"Great Quality.  My daughter wears a size 5/6 in her current school uniform.  And after following the size chart, I ordered a size 6 for girls.  And when it arrived, it fitted more like a size 7/8...which was too big for my daughter.  So I will be returning this and getting a smaller size down.  I hope this helps other parents to size for your daughter."
4.0,"I'm 5'4&#34;, about 170. I ordered a Large. This dress is beautiful and seems to be well made. I really wanted it to fit to wear as a dress, without having to wear pants, leggings or tights under it but it was very short. The material is soft and beautiful but slightly see through so I had to wear a short black dress underneath it and even then the length was questionable (does not pass the fingertip challenge, fails by a couple inches actually). It's beautifully flowy with a lot of extra material which might make it cute to belt and wear over leggings or skinny jeans. I washed in cold water on gentle and laid flat to dry and it shrunk up significantly so now it's a flowy top that will hopefully look cute belted."
4.0,"Larger in diameter than a quarter, but nice pendant. Chain is cheap quality though."
4.0,Shirt is vety nice but can be snug if not ordered a little larger than needed
4.0,"Students loved them, but there were four of the 24 that didn’t light up."
4.0,These are good quality and easy to use. Helps complete many different looks. Very happy
4.0,I think they are cute but tiny. I wish they were a bit bigger.
4.0,"Well made from heavy duty material. This wallet is perfect for a few cards and some cash or organizing your edc. I use mine as a holster for my Cree Q5 flashlight, a Bic lighter and my Fisher space pen. Great little wallet/ pocket caddy."
4.0,I’ve actually bought several of these watches in different colors and everyone admires them! It says that they are real leather.. trust me that they are not genuine leather!!
4.0,Love the bag. Big with a lot of zippers.
4.0,"The white band fit just fine and was secure for 6 weeks.  The snap is a improvement over the original band.<br />The sand pink and lilac are both greyed colors.  The Lilac does not look good with the lavender INSPIRE HR.<br />I gave them away as I don't like the colors.  The white is nice.<br />However, after 6 weeks, I woke up and noticed the band was tearing where it attaches to the watch.  In 3 days, it broke completely off.  Sigh."
4.0,Wear one of the mask before and after my wedding. Looked great!!!
4.0,Funny and cute
4.0,"Very cute and works well with multiple colored bras and bottoms.  Although not a problem for me, others have said it is too thin.  I like it for just that reason, not too heavy and hot but a bra is needed for privacy and support."
4.0,"THIS IS A GOOD BUY, THE MATERIAL IS SOFT AND COMFORTABLE AND NOT SEE THROUGH, I ONLY NEED TO ALTER THE UNDER ARMS MY BUST IS 43""  WAIST 38""  HIPS 48"" AND I BOUGHT XXL. IT HITS RIGHT ON THE KNEES."
4.0,"Comfortable fit as expected, keeps your feet warm. The plastic ribbon on top comes apart very easily. Overall good."
4.0,These worked great for my dwarf costume. These fit and stayed on my ears the whole night. A little tricky to apply but not bad once you figure it out. I'm on the smaller side for ears and these stayed on and looked great.
4.0,It’s a really nice jacket but fits way too small for a XL.<br />Disappointed because it’s a nice jacket. I’m 5’10/220 and it was more like a generous medium to large fit. I have to return it.
4.0,"This hoodie is ok but the cut was a bit weird.  The material is soft and pretty thin, it doesn't do much for cold weather. The embroidery looks very nice.  While it is supposed to be cropped, the back rode higher than the front which was probably not the intention.  My daughter likes this a lot, especially as it is suitable for springtime  weather due to being thin."
4.0,Really cute.. Bigger then I expected it’s definitely not for your keys more so for a book bag or purse..
4.0,Size great
4.0,This jewelry piece was very light in weight. I thought it would be of a heavier feel.<br />But the pieces were versatile it allows you to wear them alone or together. It has extended space to make it suit your look as you want
4.0,"Overall, this watch is wonderful. It looks stunning, has a weight that makes it seem substantial, and has the reliability that comes with any Timex. After a month of use, I really only have one - admittedly minor - complaint with it: the noise.<br /><br />This watch exemplifies Timex's old slogan &#34;takes a licking and keeps on ticking.&#34; This watch truly ticks, occasionally to the point of being incredibly annoying. I, due to some poor decisions when I was younger, have awful hearing. I constantly ask people to repeat themselves because I mishear them. I have trouble hearing things that other people around me hear. However, I've noticed this watch ticking after placing it down on a dresser on the other side of the room - it's that loud. On a soft surface, however (such as when it's on a wrist) it's not particularly noticeable at all. As long as you take caution when placing it down after taking it off, the noise isn't anything to worry about.<br /><br />This is a watch that I don't mind wearing when doing hard work and crawling through an attic, but it's also a watch that can be worn with a dress shirt  in a business setting. Overall, it's an all-around great product."
4.0,good fit and good quality but i am not in love with it. it's quite good but i just not a favorite of mine
4.0,this product wears down quickly after 3-4 washes and begins to pill. Lower quality cotton.
4.0,Was Christmas gift. Went over well.
4.0,i bought these for pullups they work great during my workout.
4.0,"Cute, but I ordered two colors.  One had sleeve length pictured, the other had much shorter, almost cap sleeves.  Super comfy."
4.0,"Three stars because I love the sweet reminder behind it , It’s over priced as all things are relating to sobriety 🤷‍♀️ I guess it’s a play on emotion . It’s a great reminder , but considering the quality of the product it’s too much , it’s not bad quality , it’s more a 5-6$ item"
4.0,The print is pretty looks exactly like the pic only downside is the material is a little thick to be a summer maxi dress
4.0,"Nice quality, fit a 4 year old."
4.0,Loved the pink To much green but so cool
4.0,Good material fits well
4.0,"This is a very nicely made and really sexy blouse.  The seams and stitching are well done.  The sleeves and arms fit a truly larger woman.  The open netting on the sleeve give a nice, sexy look.  The length is right for a woman over 5'7"".  My daughter is 5'10"" and it fits nicely on her.  The fit is snug but not tight for medium bodies.  The material is a comfortable polyester, and it feels good enough, not cotton, but, again, comfortable and easy to wear, breathable.  The neck line is low without being revealing.  Overall, this is a nice blouse for a different look, date night for sure, and should last."
4.0,Comfortable ! Get the job done
4.0,"Nice assortment of watch bands; fit my Timex Weekender perfectly. Note that the band in the upper left of the photograph is black/red, not navy blue/red as I assumed. Not really a problem though, still perfectly acceptable."
4.0,Bought this for my daughter's Halloween costume (she was Beyonce' from the Formation video). : )  It was great for that. It was very light and made for good costume jewelry.
4.0,"Being a very tall woman (six foot one to be exact) It can be somewhat hard to find clothing, without shopping in the plus size department. I absolutely loved this shirt. I purchased the 2x size, it fell a little below my waist. I can use for my yoga and Pilates classes as well as an everyday shirt with jeans. I loved it so much that I was forced to buy the same shirt in pink as well. :) I am very pleased with this product."
4.0,"I read some of the reviews about the size running small so I ordered a bigger size , the cups on the bigger size fits good but the band is still snug but it looks great  would buy again"
4.0,"its actually pretty nice, got them for my daughter in laws,  they love them too. the lace is soft and washes up great, a must get for you summer wardrobe"
4.0,For the price this scarf is pretty cute and looks exactly as pictured on the model. Scarf looks more expensive then it is. I have a thing about not paying much for a scarf cause the expensive ones tend not to look that much better then cute bargain scarves. This is a keeper if you are on the fence.
4.0,Good fit. Nice heavy weight cotton material. I like the design!  I really hate all the thin material t shirts that are sold now days! It is getting harder to find good heavy weight cotton. This one has it!
4.0,The loop on the back tore after only 2 months. :(
4.0,The links are small but it was a gift and the person I bought it for loves it.
4.0,"Great Deal, just what I was looking for."
4.0,"I am 5'10"" and was concerned that the rise would be too short. A large fits both me and my 5'7"" daughter and is the most comfortable jumpsuit! It is like wearing pjs but looks trendy and sophisticated. Can be dressed up or down! Foe reference I am a pretty solid size 10."
4.0,This is a great looking ring. Sizing is correct too.
4.0,Longer than I wanted
4.0,This is a good sized purse for shopping when you carry just a few items.
4.0,"Very pretty color , fits comfortable , material is soft but sleeves are pretty long . I ordered a medium"
4.0,It is the same as the picture but it's hard to stay around your wrist
4.0,Lightweight hooded zip-up sweatshirt is great! Stays dry even when you're wet. Russell knows how to make good products!
4.0,Ordered in the middle of December.<br />I have sweaters from this company and love then but this one must be coming by a slow boat from Ireland.<br />LOL
4.0,"I don't write reviews but I had SUCH a hard time shopping for these because of the lack of reviews I thought I would try to help. The ones that had reviews were basically - ""SO sparkly and pretty, LOVE it!"". Not helpful to me as I wasn't going for hoarkin peice of glitter but a reasonably believable diamond substitute. I will say, the setting with the millgrain and pave is very pretty. Anyone, without really close inspection, would never know a. it's sterling as the rhodium plating is done well (that's what on your 14k white gold anyway) and b. that the pave isn't diamonds, especially if you keep it clean. But that center stone... Ohye.<br /><br />I ordered 3 rings (photo top to bottom) 1. DovEggs 1.5ct equiv center, 2. Random 1ct equiv center that was supposed to be moissanite but I believe is actually CZ and 3. This San Moissan double halo ring. They ranged in price from $79 - $150 all 925 sterling.<br /><br />1. Won hands down over all, the offset cushion cut. The setting was lovely and the cut and color of the center stone was definitely the best, for a moissanite if that's what you're looking for. BUT these manufacturers are so stuck on these large center stones and to me, they're just not believable as a realistic size. I mean, I don't know about you but, I'm not trying to pass off that I spent 8 grand on a diamond even if I am driving around in an Audi. Besides, with the color of a moissanite, no one is going to buy that story anyway. But is it lovely if you're announcing that you're bucking DeBeers and the entire diamond industry to everyone? ABSOLUTELY. I just wish there were more options in the .75 - 1ct centers for me. I may have stuck with this type of ring.<br /><br />2. This one supposed to be moissanite, fairly certain it's CZ. This one I actually almost kept. Funny enough. For the money, you can't beat it. It's a great cut, the color is WAY closer to a real diamond and from a distance, especially because of the smaller center stone, it's believable. Based on this experience, if you're trying to pass off a diamond, smaller, quality CZ like this with halos and pave is definitely the way to go. In the end I just didn't like this shape on my hand which is why I didn't keep it for my - I'm afraid of hurting my real ring - spare.<br /><br />3. San Moissan MilGrain Band 1.05ct DEW (6.5mm) this ring. Really nice, believable setting and at first glace, the one people liked the best. But the center stone does not appear to be cut as nicely as the DovEggs one. Much more ""glassy"" looking at certain angles which I assume is light leak in the cut, but I'm no pro. And fyi, if you're looking for a more believable size, this states 1.05ct center - that's a moissanite carat which works out to be about 1.5 diamond weight. 1ct diamond rounds are around 6mm. You wouldn't think that .5mm would make that much difference in giving it a ""Home Shopping Network / QVC"" look but, it does. I mean if that's your thing, go for it. But that's not what I was looking for. With a stone similar to #1, this would have been a tougher decision.<br /><br />In the end, I went real, 1ct diamond - estate jewelry, making it more affordable. I'm an adult, with houses to pay for, cars to build and dogs to feed. It's a second marriage so I'm not going bonkers this time around. BUT in the end, it's just not a diamond. I know they're not investments, apparently they're just what I like. My advice is, for an anti diamond statement - go for it. Any of these 3 you would think were lovely. If you're trying to look ""diamond enough"" look up your local estate jeweler or reputable pawn. Pawn shops aren't what they used to be and many guarantee their jewelry, provide sizing, polishing, plating, etc. Do your homework, haggle, and you'll be shocked to see how fast that $4500 1ct ring ring turns into a $1500-$2000 one. Personally that's my way of sticking it to the jewelry industry!"
4.0,You have to assemble them (the nose piece) and ships in no packaging so not very good for gifting.
4.0,"My girls are going to love them, I bought them for party favors and it came with 2  bracelets has well, the charms fits them perfectly and such a great value for the price"
4.0,Colorful and convenient to you
4.0,"These are a bit too big for my son, but he loves them and hopes to fit in them next spring."
4.0,I had to repair the strap the first day I word them. Instead of holes for the buckle there was one long slit
4.0,Good product.  Low quality
4.0,"Pretty, cute, but fit smaller than my other Koi Bliss tops."
4.0,Very nice although I would have preferred a different clasp.
4.0,Love that so many colors are available.  I wear compression sleeves every day and like having a variety of choices. I do wish you had a pick 3 option so one could get the exact 3 colors one wants.
4.0,Wrong color though...
4.0,These earrings were a little larger than I expected. I bought them for a 9-year old girl. She absolutely loved them and they definitely looked good so overall I was happy with them.
4.0,They are so cute.  Not very comfortable on the nose.
4.0,"Was very pleased with this lightweight cardigan, but the fit was a little smaller than expected"
4.0,"Is somewhat big, but not that big a deal.  Looks very good."
4.0,"I like the hat even though this particular hat is not oversized like I thought. Very nice hat made of 40% wool and 60% polyester which means the hat will last for years. Even though it's described as light brown, it's actually a darker brown. I wear a size large and it fits fine. I definitely would buy another when more of a selection is in."
4.0,"This is a nice dress for the price. I've worn it for two of my baby showers and I always get compliments. I'm 5'3&#34;, 143lbs (125 pre-pregnancy) and 7.5 months pregnant. It barely touchs the top of my feet, so it's not a super long maxi dress, which I like. It offers modest coverage without being stifling in the summer, and the waist band is flattering just below the bust. My biggest wish for this dress, as a nice spring/summer maternity dress, is that it was made of a more breathable fabric, instead of polyester. At times it makes me sweat and sticks in undignified places. Also, for me, it could be a little tighter through the waistband. I ordered a small and it fits perfectly everywhere else but just feels a little too loose under the bust and makes me feel a little shapeless. I realize that some women may prefer or need that extra space though."
4.0,"the color, the size, the feeling, the look, everything is great, except that the zipper, often open without notice, a little bit awkward"
4.0,awesome product runs a little long but not to bad
4.0,I really liked this. But to small
4.0,Love the colors and it is stretchy
4.0,"Really cute. But a bit clingy, could have probably done ok getting a large."
4.0,I see a lot of people complain they are thin. I think this is a good thing for a summer shirt. They look and fit great! My only complaint is they are dog fur magnets.
4.0,Will need slip if not using as a pool cover up. Runs big.
4.0,Love the material I wish they could be little longer
4.0,"Very cute. Wondering if I can wash them with the leather straps, so I keep them clean:)"
4.0,"This mask looks great and is very comfortable which is why I gave it 4 stars but you should not wear it during the COVID-19 pandemic. I always test the safety of all my COVID-19 face masks by wearing it and see if I can blow out a candle with it. If you can blow out the flame with it on, it's NOT safe to wear which is exactly what happened while testing this mask, even when I doubled the thickness of it."
4.0,The bra fits beautiful  but the panty cut very small this is not for  women  with large butts  it their any way u can have sizes for the bottoms as well
4.0,Just need to be broken in but super cute.
4.0,"First off I want to say (Yay)&#34; I got it Way before I was supposed to get it so that's a Plus+ ...<br />I am 5&#34;4 135Lb. Normally would order a Medium but I want it to cover my bottom so I choose XL insted , although I think they run True to size.<br />The fabric feels almost like the kind of shirts for working out its Soft , I'm happy with my purchase ,...<br />One More thing this shirt can be used as long and short sleeve<br />I think this shirt was not fancy enough that's way I gave it the 4 Stars ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️"
4.0,"Great fit , especially if you are larger in top and bottom. Ruching is coming apart at bust but it looks ok"
4.0,"Very nice, fits just right"
4.0,"It is a good, comfortable Jersey. The only concern I had was that the rear zipper pocket is fake. It is connected to the center pocket."
4.0,"Really nice material and attractive design for active tennis!  Fit is &#34;somewhat small&#34; e.g., somewhat fitted and would help if a bit longer in length."
4.0,"Comfy little dresses. I initially ordered an XL and it was slightly too big in the chest, belly and hips, so I decided to buy a couple of them in L and I looked like I was wearing sausage casings. I wear an 8/10/M in most clothing."
4.0,Good quality but runs large. Also then top flares out at the bottom.
4.0,"Nice but was too small,returned it with zero issues 🤘"
4.0,"The necklace at a distance is really lovely and unique. Up close when you touch it you can tell the material is on the cheaper side, but despite me wearing it now 5 or 6 times, it has held up. I wish it was two separate necklaces or that the smaller chain were shorter, just to space out the pendants a little bit more. But overall for the price, these are pretty necklaces and they pair well with rose gold or black stud earrings (which is what I paired them with, all on top of a black sweater)."
4.0,"Loved the look, but didn't work"
4.0,The only thing I can say bad about these tees is that the collar went bad after washing.
4.0,Too small got an xlarge. My error but it's well made and I do like it for the price.
4.0,"This is a really cute outfit, but I'm 5'7.5&#34; and the pants were about 2 inches too long for me.<br /> Other than that, I love it! It's really comfortable and I've gotten lots of compliments."
4.0,"A little bit on the sheer side, but still not see-through with a darker color (I got the space gray). Fit true to size and super comfy! No problems with sweat stains, but some loose threads after a few washes."
4.0,"I was concerned about going true to size or going off their chart. Thankfully I went off their chart. The under short wears pretty snug at the top and proper on the thighs. The shorts themselves are a good fit, a little loose at the waist but between the drawstring and compression shorts, they hold up pretty good. I do have issue with bending over as the compression short wants to pull my rear down a bit and give me plumber crack. The phone pocket is clutch! Does a great job!<br /><br />Overall, I really like these shorts! They aren't perfect but there is a lot to like!"
4.0,Nice earrings.  I like the size.  They aren't real big!
4.0,"Really nice and soft.  I have an ugly scar on my neck.  A lot of scarves irritate my scar, this does not and it is beautiful."
4.0,Very light and looks good.
4.0,"Purchased as a graduation gift for our niece who will graduate in December 2015, we only checked to be sure it would run and the appearance.  All appears to be okay.  Some previous reviews indicated that the clasp seemed inferior.  This clasp seems quite sturdy."
4.0,"Not as dark as I expect and it's quite snug fits larger width face.<br />I need some to fit my wide width face, these do nicely but the arms need more length andthe tint isn’t dark, more like driving glasses."
4.0,"These will work for a FitBit Sense 2, however, the bands are a little narrow and they could be a little thicker.  Not bad though for the price.  It is very hard to find elastic bands that will fit the Sense 2."
4.0,love it  wish it had a pocket though
4.0,"Very nice necklace, the tree is a bit larger than I had thought, but still very pretty. I do like it very much!"
4.0,I just brought it to big
4.0,"I purchased these earrings to complete a Snow White inspired outfit for a recent trip to Disneyland and could not wait for them to arrive. After reviewing previous comments, I was worried they would be very small, but they were fine for my average ear size."
4.0,nive glasses but a bit heavy
4.0,super cute shorty shorts - i love these comfy shorts. I have a 29 waist & 39 hip. I ordered a medium. The shorts are stretchy not like spandex but stretchy enough for comfort (and im big on comfort) I would highly recommend these shorts if your looking for cute casual shorts for the summer or a vacay
4.0,Luv it but was a bit small..
4.0,"The top is super soft. The fit a just there . Not snug , not loose. The length for me was on point . In the waist .Is not a crop top. I like it. Perfect black top to play for dress up or casual style."
4.0,"I just came across this ALMOST exact shirt at a boutique for 45 dollars!  This shirt is great and such a great price.  It is definitely more of a brown than what I expected.  But, I am still a fan!"
4.0,Came quickly. Love this purse. What threw me off a little is that it is brown lining. Otherwise love it.
4.0,"Owl is quite big. But the length of the necklace is not so long, that's why 4 stars otherwise u would have given 5. Overall it's a good quality and fun necklace! 👍"
4.0,"These seem to show a lot when wearing my flats, even after washing, maybe I should wash them in hot water. Nice comfortable liner, if only they didn't show."
4.0,Like the crochet but this one is lighter that expected. The bottom section is heavy so it makes the dress looks dragged. It's a beautiful dress and design but it did not work well together in wear
4.0,"Luv it, it's not quite how it looks on the image but it's wearable☺️"
4.0,Well i can see w these. Colors are nice. Look 2 big for my face.
4.0,"It works as described, I like it better than the ones that go around your neck. Only con is that the material is some kind of foam and is delicate so not sure how durable this will be (will update in a few months)"
4.0,"Quality is pretty good, even the “armor” pieces. I got a size small but the pants were too small for me and the top was too big for some reason. The belt is a little on the smaller side (nothing adding more pleather won’t fix) and the suspenders like straps are too long. The arm piece was way too big for me but it looked good for what it is. It’s definitely a fixer upper but nothing unmanageable."
4.0,"Good for the most part, one of the emblems was a little slanted."
4.0,"A nice suit, a little on the big side.  The reviews scared me into buying 1 size larger than what I would normally buy.  That size was wayyyy too big.  Had to return and go with her size which fit for the most part.  I will say I wish the hands were not gloved.<br />Would have been cool if they were separate.  Worn to a costume party and when it was time to eat I realized she was going to have a problem lol.  Just an FYI."
4.0,"My only complaint is I wish they had pockets, but like them so much I bought another pair. They are perfect for Hot Texas summers, breathable, and as with linen like fabric, they do wrinkle. I pair them with a Tee and loose boyfriend blazer, great outfit with sandals"
4.0,"It's what I love about the 80's. I had some outfits that needed a little fashionizing. It's not a word, but it will work here.<br /><br />The velcro attaches under your strap, but doesn't attach the entire way. Sometimes I found safety pins did a little better--if it wouldn't damage my fabric. These are not too noticeable, just a little puff, where needed. I use them more than I would like to say. Blush."
4.0,"Bought this dress and the bust is as everyone says: large. I am a chesty person and I cannot fill this dress, it is very cute though and I will be wearing it in family photos."
4.0,"I bought a three pack and two out of three of them fit fine. The third one had gaping arm holes!  I wish I could just exchange that one instead of the whole package.<br /><br />UPDATE: got a replscement, worked up a sweat hiking in the Rockies - fabric is not moisture wicking!"
4.0,"good price, good looks. fast shipping"
4.0,very nice... very silky...
4.0,"I loved how it looked, but the zipper is so delicate, I'm afraid to wear it to work in case it breaks. It's great for a stylish touch though!"
4.0,"The robe I received was just what I wanted, except it was a little too small to be comfortable as a robe. I usually wear a size 10 and ordered the S/M, but  I've returned it for a ""One Size"" and expect that will be fine. Be sure to read the description of the sizes, as they may be different than what you're used to. Otherwise, the quality is good and the colors are pretty."
4.0,It's a cute dress with a good fit. Requires ironing to look right. But I was not really impressed with the material. It feels/looks a little on the  cheap side. I wore it to an evening party so couldn't really tell the equality of the fabric
4.0,"It has a secure fit without being too tight. I wish the brim was wider to shade more of face, but it is cute and well made."
4.0,These shoes are really cute and very flexible. They are a little wide.
4.0,A little bit Long but good material
4.0,"They definitely helped, however, I think they should be a little wider for comfort"
4.0,"The material is a little stiffer than I expected, but I absolutely love the color. It is difficult to slide the clear band to secure the strap but it is not necessary to use it anyway, the clasp holds tight by itself.<br /><br />I would recommend."
4.0,"Beautiful dress. Only gripe is I’m 5’3” and the dress is really long. With my 5’ stilettos, the spikes in my heels of my left foot kept getting stuck in the laser design holes at the bottom of the dress. Subconsciously I found myself raising the dress so I don’t trip"
4.0,"The bag is shiny.. But overall the quality of the bag is nice. It's sturdy and the straps are thick. Also, theres a zipper in the behind the backpack where you can put in your card or lip gloss. Overall the size is nice, you can put a lot of things in there. My favorite part is the zipper. It easily glides back and forth for easy access to whatever you need inside your bag. I looked closely at the squared logo to find what it says, it's all gibberish. My brother thought this bag was a high end product & was surprised when I told him it wasn't. Overall, this bag is great for everyday wear. The only reason why I'm giving it only 4 stars is because I'm just not happy with shiny sheen it gives off from the bag, other than that.. I like~"
4.0,"I found that it fits pretty true to size, and looks so cute. It looks exactly like the picture and is the perfect weight...not too hot and not too cold."
4.0,"If you have narrow feet, this shoe causes your feet to hang over the front. Otherwise, these are great shoes."
4.0,Very nice but somewhat smaller than expected.
4.0,Tela muy dura
4.0,"Fit is true to size, super comfy and great fabric. Only negative is the waist band is lower quality and flips sometimes, so its not perfect."
4.0,I must say the pints of ice cream were not melting when I got home 20 minutes later.  A little pricy but if they last it will be worth it during 100 plus summer Temps in TX
4.0,"Got this for my husbands gearfit2. It looks and fits the watch great. The tool sent with it looks a bit weak and we had a local shop remove the links. They commented that seemed to be of good quality and feel. So, so far so good."
4.0,"Came vacuum sealed, which helps in the shipping process. Can fit in a mailbox if necessary. VERY soft! Not much fallout from the fabric, but some did. Super warm."
4.0,Love it is somewhat large in the sleeves
4.0,"Good quality, received it quick and in excellent condition. Would recommend it to anyone."
4.0,"It is a real pretty swimsuit. I purchased a size bigger for the top, but it's still a bit too small, but the bottom is limit ok. When I read the comments I hoped the top would fit, as some said it was on the bitter side, but I was actually a bit small for me, but I am larger (the boob) than most of my size. If it wasn't of the wire and molded cup it would work, so I'll just have to work around that as I really like it anyway."
4.0,Un poco grande.
4.0,I really liked this bathing suit.
4.0,Very cute! They run extremely small though...
4.0,"I'm not a cosplayer so I wasn't trying to pay 50$ for something I wasn't going to wear haha. It works but if you're looking to make it exact, here's my critiques.<br />1. The red jacket is boxier then Yumeko's, I have to tie it in the back. Also, the bottom button should be a little lower and the lines on the side should be a little less thick. They also didn't include the stitching on the middle sides of the suit.<br />2. The neck tie is a lot longer, it doesn't button so you have to put it on over your head, you can't cut it and shorten it or it won't go over your head.<br />3. It comes with over-the-knee socks instead of full black tights.<br />4. The white collared undershirt is very tight. I ordered a small because the size chart said it would fit me best (I am 5'2, 105lbs, very flat chested) but it fit very tight around my arms/shoulders/chest. I am afraid it might rip, luckily I have another white collared shirt I can use. The sleeves are also not long enough because you're supposed to be able to see them coming out from the red jacket.<br />5. You have to order the wig separately, I knew this so I got a cheap black wig with bangs.<br />6. The skirt is thin and the inside is white, but it zips up<br />7. You can't expect good comfortable material for this price so keep that in mind!<br /><br />Overall, good for the price but has a few details that are off."
4.0,A little to wide to wear under your bike helmet.
4.0,"I bought these shirts to match shorts of same brand name. I was slightly disappointed in colors as they did not match shorts. The white one was tighter than the grey and black, and consequently too see thru. The other two shirts fit a little snug around the middle, but wearable. They wash up well and are well made with lightweight quality fabric. I liked them so much I ordered 3 more!"
4.0,"Their an ok fit., but wow I have to hem the pant legs about 5 inches. Good for taller ladies. I am 5' 5&#34;.Other than that they're beautiful. I don't want to hem them since I will loose the smiley face on the bottom leg."
4.0,"This was a good fit for me, and caused me not to spend a lot of money."
4.0,Cute! It's a thin hoodie I washed it and dried it and still looks great!
4.0,great costume. our daughter wore it for halloween with doll makeup and a broken heart mylar balloon. very effective!
4.0,"This is a very cute gift for a father, but it is expensive for what it is. Worth it for the heartfelt message, but the box is cheap and isn't packaged well and isn't that fancy for a 13 dollar guitar pick."
4.0,"These were purchased to wear for a parade costume.  They were light weight comfortable. I have a 26 1/2"" inseam and the length was perfect. So a taller person would have issues. The design is only on the front which was a bit of a disappointment."
4.0,Beautiful design...but the shoes definitely run small. Buy a full size up.
4.0,Nice dress for the price. Fits nicely.
4.0,Graft jacket
4.0,Has a good  weight to them and they are very pretty with a little bit of bling bling.
4.0,"Bought this for my daughter for Christmas.  She loves it and shows it off to her classmates and teachers at school.  The only thing is that it seems a bit small for her, and she is only 4 years old.  She doesn't have a big head so I'm not sure why it fits so tightly.  She doesn't seem to mind, however, so overall I'm happy with it!"
4.0,It is very cute! I noticed someone said it turned color when they wore it in the water so I have yet to but the paint has chipped in some places
4.0,Love the color.  Very pretty but shoulders and sleeves seem to be cut smaller.
4.0,"Beautiful piece that is very shiny and has quite a bit of detail.  I gave it four stars instead of five because I am not convinced that this is sterling silver even tho' the .925 stamp is there.  One person said the description listed it as silver plated, but I was not able to locate that wording.  All that said, it is a lovely piece that I will either give as a gift or keep as an art piece.  It is a classy oriental dragon.  Definitely looks more expensive than the purchase price."
4.0,kind of thin in the lining but looks really good.
4.0,"I was worried this would be too see through, but it’s actually not bad at all! It’s fairly thick, the material isn’t the softest, but it isn’t “scratchy” either.  I bought a large and could have probably gone with a medium, there’s quite a bit of extra fabric that kind of hangs if I don’t cinch the waist. I feel like taller people can wear this well, or at least longer-waisted people. I’m 5’4” and 160 for reference, and carry my weight in my butt and thighs mostly. Overall, I like it and am keeping it."
4.0,Comfy material okay<br />would rebuy<br />great for price
4.0,Little flimsy and a little rough on certain spots of the heel. overall worth the money !
4.0,A case like this costs $50 from Barnes and Noble!<br /><br />The propped-up arrangements shown in the pictures don't work very well because the cover wants to lie flat; it won't stay in the needed triangular shape by itself.<br /><br />The hand strap is sort of pointless.<br /><br />I like the cover strap and the stylus loop.
4.0,"Super cute suit in person and seems to be a good quality fabric. I’d say the sizing is a little off. Ordered an 8T (what the heck is that?!) for my 4 year old, and hoped it was a little big. Not so much. I’m order to get the torso pulled up to cover her chest, the straps need to be tighter than I can imagine is comfortable.<br /><br />Nonetheless, she loves it and for the price, I won’t worry with a return. The next size up would probably be too big.<br /><br />I am impressed with the headband and she’s kept it on since we got it today."
4.0,VERY COMFORTABLE!!!!
4.0,Like everything about these medical wristbands EXCEPT - sure wish I could have 4 gray ones.  I don't like the other colors at all.  The gray is understated but also clearly readable.
4.0,I love the tail. It is made of a legging material and has Velcro on the fins so you can easily open and close them. I'm a size 6 and was able to fit into the medium. It is a little tighter than I would like but it is worth it for the price.
4.0,"Super cute but unfortunately they ran a little small for me. Even after sizing up, the flatness of the sandal caused my feet to spill off the sides a little. Had to return."
4.0,"Color is good, just a little big"
4.0,"I really like the feel and convenience of it.  Perfect for those who are D or double D and don't want to bounce around braless but want to wear spaghetti straps.  However, I think they are a tad bit too small.  Wish they provided a bit more coverage."
4.0,"Size is great. When front pockets are loaded, it likes to topple over. Beautiful design and durable. There's room for everything and then some!"
4.0,Runs a little small.  Also lettering is a brighter green.  Expected closer to off-white.
4.0,"These leggings can’t be beat for the price. Buttery smooth and don’t pill! They aren’t the most flattering if you have a little tummy, but I love these for lounging around the house. They are extremely stretchy and wash/dry well. I’ve had no issues with loose strings or rips like I have with other cheap leggings. I just wish they were a little more fitted in the waist to help hold in my mom tummy."
4.0,I love the leg length and material. My only concern is is that the waist band is a little tight. Also you are supposed to hang dry these yoga pants<br /> Overall I am really happy with my purchase and they are very flattering on my figure.
4.0,"Really cute, lightweight material however did not fit my body type."
4.0,Super cute dress! I wore it to my daughter's beach wedding.
4.0,"This is the first time I tried two pieces dress. To be honest I was skeptical to buy it in the beginning, you might ask why? The reason I was skeptical because some of my friends told me it is not good to buy dress from the internet because you can’t try it. Yes, what they said are correct, but I just want to give a try. Honestly, I have read all different reviews before I bought this dress, and I did not feel disappointed at all. The reason I gave four stars because the material is too thin, other than that I have nothing can complain. When I put on that dress, and I looked in the mirror. Yes, this is the dress I have been looking for. I really like the design, showed my body shape perfectly. I also ordered a white color, but white color is not exactly white color. It’s more like gray color which is I don’t like. So I returned the white color and I keep this black color. By the way, I am 5’6”, 140 lbs. 36-28-36."
4.0,Adequate...
4.0,"I was looking for something inexpensive for an upcoming trip, that will not take up much room in the suitcase, will wash well and dry quickly - this fits the requirements!"
4.0,"This is a nicely-made dress, however it has the type of neckline that can expand to show well, maybe too much.  You must wear a strapless bra underneath, and make sure at all times the neckline does not slip down.  It's great if your shoulders are your best feature, and a small necklace or piece of jewelry would be a nice thing to wear.  The rest of the dress is nicely dressy and could be worn to a cocktail party.  It has nicely ruffled panels, and it's pretty.  It's a neutral color, so you can accessorize in any direction.  It would be nicely in place in the summer or winter.  It's a versatile product.  Very nice."
4.0,Fit perfect came in the time promised only thing was jus 2 colors other than tht can’t complain price great compared to where i am from
4.0,"the color isn't technically  ""lime green"" it's more like the fluorescent workers jacket green.... these are realllyyyy cute!!!! they run very small...i wear a size 8 but according to reviews i got a 9 😳 but the 9 does fit perfectly...the problem is the area across the toes is too tight. i love the way these look so much i'm just going to have to tough it out with the pain (beauty is pain lol) but regardless of what size u get, the toe area will be too tight... so if ur like me and know how to deal with pain of heels then u can get them but u must go a ""whole"" size up...really cute shoes tho i'm going to get the tan pair next ""if"" i can deal with the pain across the top of my toes 1st!!!"
4.0,They do not keep my hands as warm as I would like when grabbing a cold steering wheel
4.0,Perfect for the costume. Although they did run a little smaller than described.
4.0,"I am happy to add this boot to my collection of Giorgio Brutini, bringing my total to at least six pair.  I paid $13 for this shoe, but I would have been just as happy at twice that price.  I like GB because it has the style and quality of a designer shoe selling at over $100, but is regularly priced below $50 at discount retailers.  One feature I like most about GB in general, and this boot in particular, is the leather lining and rubber sole.  I do not like synthetic shoe, and I avoid synthetic leathers.  The real leather in this boot is visually appealing and comfortable to the touch.  My only slight concern about this boot is that the chukka-style boot does not wrap comfortably around my ankle. But, I understand that is what a chukka boot is supposed to do. Below the ankle, this boot feels the same as a nice dress shoe.  Above the ankle, it's a chukka boot, so don't expect the support or comfort of a hi-top sneaker or a hiking boot.  The size 12 fits as expected."
4.0,"Nice added touch to the Santa image. Clear glass adds realistic look and preferable over some less expensive ones, although very reasonably priced."
4.0,"Cute, steampunk bloomer type pants, but they fit large."
4.0,"Awesome jacket! I can't wait to wear it this fall. Appears decently made, but I cannot yet attest to its durability. A note on sizing: I usually order a small/medium depending on the designer. I ordered a medium and it zips but it is DEFINITELY snug. Perhaps it is a junior's medium? Luckily I have a wedding coming up some I'm trying to get a little more in shape anyway."
4.0,"I was pretty happy with this necklace. I honestly did not fit around my neck as my neck is a bit thick, however it did fit. This necklace is not quite as high quality as it looks in the picture, more the quality of something you can get at a costume store. My biggest complaint is with the center “stone” which is just sewn into the lace and is a bit off center. It also seems to tangle easily with the chains, and it is very hard to keep it centered and untangled. This necklace would be great for something like a Halloween costume for a night, but if you are looking for something for everyday wear, or for a special occasion, this is most likely not going to be it.  All in all, I am happy with this purchase, and would not hesitate to buy from this seller in the future.<br /><br />I received the product for free or at a discount in exchanged for my honest, unbiased, personal review. My opinion was in no way influenced by the seller, Amazon, or the fact that I received this item for free or at a discount.  All views expressed are solely my own."
4.0,"Beautiful well made dress. Anything labeled form fitting I always order one size up. The dress fit great thru the waist and hip area but was quite large in the arm area.  I am 5'4 130lbs and a 36D. Other dresses can be too small/tight in the chest area due to my chest size, not this dress. There is a quite amount of gapping in the underarm area. I should have probably ordered a medium, but given how well the large fits in the waist and hip area I fear that a medium would be too tight.  OH well"
4.0,"The first pair I ordered I sized up but they were still too small.  The company did send a new pair for me but it took a long time to get to me.  The next pair, which at this point was now two sizes bigger than what she wears were too big.  However, my niece LOVES them!  They are beautiful shoes, and we put tights and socks on her the other day just so she could wear them because she insisted! I don't know if I would order again, because the sizing is all over the place, but they are so pretty that I might be tempted to take the risk."
4.0,"They are ok, a little bunchy in the crotch but mostly I'm happy"
4.0,it’s was amazing 😉
4.0,Nice shoes for the price. My daughter is enjoying them.
4.0,"Pants were great. The way it opens for nursing isn't awesome. It gaps and left me feeling more exposed when I wasn't nursing than when I was. I love the pants because they went over my c-section incision without rubbing it. Basically, I loved the pants and just write a nursing tank instead of the pj top."
4.0,"I usually stay away from larger framed glasses even though they are in style right now... i get headaches if things are too heavy on the bridge of my nose. Anyway, i decided to take a chance on a pair of larger sunglasses & i'm glad i did. Not only are these really cute, but they also look good on me & do NOT give me headaches... yay!!! My only negative would be that they make my face sweat where the rims sit on my cheeks over a long period of time (i live in FL... very warm climate), but at least if i am gonna sweat, i will look cute doing it ;)"
4.0,Wish it came in a size bigger
4.0,"The only problem is that the neck is too small for a man’s neck, so it doesn’t close"
4.0,Love the FitFlop sole. The lace-up canvas is great but wish the outsole was dark - anything but white - gets dirty too fast.
4.0,"I really like this tunic.  You can dress it up or down. I ordered it in black and teal.  The material has a comfortable weight to it, so I don't get too warm in it. I usually wear a medium, but I knew that I wanted this tunic to fit more loose around the midsection.  Going one size up worked perfectly for me.  It accentuates my curves perfectly, yet hides what needs to be hidden.  Now that's a win-win!"
4.0,The front is a little small compared to the thoughtful amount of space in the back. I can't really complain since this was so cheap. Not good for being active but decent for casual summer outfits when you want whatever sticks out to look okay.
4.0,"They are OK,  just have to be broken in. Not slippery enough to turn yet."
4.0,Great product comfortable fit! I would recommend them to my friends or anyone else who asks me. & I will be buying more from this company!!
4.0,"bracelet is my ""medic alert"" because I am a heart patient with a defibrillator.  bracelet is as pictured for order - appears to be extremely sturdy."
4.0,"It's a little too big to look normal on me, but if you are going for a slightly bigger chain, this is it. It's a nice quality and has a little bit of weight to it. It looks very nice. It has been put in my cosplay jewelry for now, but maybe someday I will be gutsy enough to wear it in my everyday looks."
4.0,Cheap basic watch. Fun colors for face. Very light and flimsy. Ok.
4.0,"I guess they're going to fit.  They're going to Operation Christmas Child boxes for 5-9 year old girls- a big range to 'guess' for.... the little ones might have to pin them.  I went with the white, to minimize any cultural issues if any color or print would be seen through shorts or pants."
4.0,Love this doll. I wanted something different from all those plastic dolls out there. Looks well made and clothes come off easily. Has a little trouble sitting up on potty. Does well against wall.
4.0,Ordered for my wife and its nice for price comfy she said too so win win!!!
4.0,These fit when we got them but shrunk first wash!
4.0,"After wearing one time, I noticed the sleeves were getting fuzzy.  Almost like I had worn it several times.  Very disappointed"
4.0,"(measurements at the bottom to help with sizing)<br /><br />I tbought I'd play it safe and order an XL instead of my usual M/L, but that was a mistake. I think I could've easily ordered a medium and been fine, because the material has plenty of give and is thick enough not to cling unflatteringly. The top is soft and the colors are true to the picture. It seems well made, no loose threads or uneven sewing.<br /><br />The shirt isn't constructed exactly like in the picture, the peplum is held by scrunched elastic so is looks more rumpled, but it isn't awful. The neckline is also larger than I expected and the shoulders are a bit awkward, but that may be because the top was too big for me.<br /><br />5'6 - 190lbs - pear shaped - size M/L in tops - waist 37in - chest 40in - underbust 36in - shoulders 18in"
4.0,I finally got it. Thank you. It was long because of the shortage. But I got it.  Good Condition
4.0,Love the size and very comfortable... But the zipper doesn't stay in place :'(
4.0,"Hat cool but reversible, don't get it. Put the logo on top on both sides of top, or dump the reverse and put logo on same side of service tag.  A bit priecy."
4.0,"Very cute and extremely comfortable, but the material is not great quality. They look a little cheap... not like the photo."
4.0,Love it❤️❤️❤️❤️
4.0,As described but thinner than expected.  Cute.  Not sure if worth the price but it will do and it is what daughter had chosen so...
4.0,I would have given 5 stars but the shipping took several weeks. The soles are soft but the shoe fits nicely and they're cute.
4.0,"Large, heavy, nice bag. It was larger than I expected and seemed to be good quality. The opening is much smaller than the bottom. The only bad thing so far is I haven't even used this after 2 weeks of owning. It does smell as some have posted. I have tried storing in trunk, pouring baking soda and coffee beans inside, using cleaner. It also comes with a small card that talks about the smell and gives tips. Well, so far nothing has worked.The bad smell is still there. It might have faded very slightly."
4.0,"These pants are some of the best that I've ever purchased. They run very true to size, they offer some shaping, but are still comfortable to sit and move in, they are soft yet thick, so they don't show any unsightly bumps (re: cellulite). My only thing against them is the burgundy color is more purple than the picture shows. I was hoping for a more red/maroon color, but these were definitely more on the purple side. That being said, I'm still keeping them since they are so comfy, and I'll definitely be purchasing another pair in a different color. For sizing reference, I usually wear a size 20, and I've got thicker legs and hips, but ordered a size 18 and they fit pretty well."
4.0,Trust the algirithm with this one. Order a size smaller than you wear for it to actually be a compression tank. Still soft n comfy. Long enough to tuck in.
4.0,I ordered these for my mother.  She has had a pair that is almost identical for about 12 years now.  They are about ready to fall apart and I never thought she would let go of them before they just couldn't be considered a shoe anymore.  I ordered these and she threw away the old ones the day after she got them.  I'm sure she will wear these until they start to fall apart so I guess I'll have to do this again in about 12 years.  They last a long time and she wears them a lot.  The shoes are great quality.
4.0,Needed a relatively inexpensive set of earrings that are hypoallergenic for my 9 year old who loses earrings out playing regularly.  These are perfect.
4.0,"These are wonderful shirts. I'm only taking off a star because they really didn't work for my body type. I had a feeling about this when I tried it, but returns were fast and easy. I'm 5'1&#34; and weigh about 112. I usually wear about a 4P. These would work better for thinner, taller ladies :-)"
4.0,"Great colors. Very comfortable, but they are a more of a shiny material (rather than soft)."
4.0,"Very cute dress, The red is not as bright as I was hoping."
4.0,My son thinks the sweater is on the thin side. We got him a thermal shirt to wear under it. It met my expectations for the price. I am sure it will hold up fine.
4.0,"Not a bad little pet medal, quality is good, easy to attach to collar."
4.0,Good quality shoes for the price.
4.0,"love the fit! the material is good quality,  delivered on time."
4.0,"I received this product at a discount for this review.  For the most part I really like these shirts.  They are very comfortable and do a nice job of contouring to your body.  The fit was just a little small, but the fabric does a nice job of expanding, and I'm on the muscular side so this won't be an issue for everyone.  The overall look might be just slightly on the feminine side.  Fortunately this doesn't bother me much as I even own a pair of orange pants."
4.0,Nice quality but color is not true pink as appears in add. More Lavendar/pink in person.
4.0,"Overall these pants seem like decent material, lightweight. Comfortable in waist."
4.0,"The colors are beautiful and the scarf is a good size. It is very thin, so we’ll see how it does."
4.0,I bought this for my daughter for her birthday. She likes it. The sleeves are a little short (she is a tall 13 years old) but she still likes it. Solid quality so far.
4.0,"Nice authentic looking baseball jersey. Well made, but fits slightly small."
4.0,Thick and sturdy. The desing is starting to peel off though. That's a bit of a bummer
4.0,My mom loved it.  But soon as she dried it.  It shrunk. So be careful.
4.0,"As a fan of the cereal, I have been wanting a t-shirt for many years.., I will wear it proudly!<br />Buy one for your father/grandpa or anyone that loves the cereal, they will love you for it!"
4.0,"Way cuter in person than expected. Only problems are that the white parts are pretty dang sheer, and it wasn't flattering on my chubby body."
4.0,"My students really were so excited with their gift.  They look really nice, but I wish it were adjustable since they have small wrists."
4.0,this is a gift. do not know
4.0,Band is little bit uncomfortable
4.0,Only con so far is the inside could be a bit thicker but that's being picky
4.0,Wore to a funeral and it was gorgeous. Should have went a size smaller
4.0,This goes to and drags the ground on my 5’2” height. So if you’re short plan on some heels. I got the xxl and it fits snuggly but comfy on me (40D chest).  Good for the price.
4.0,"Shipped fast, and they look great!"
4.0,Nice except for the size...will return the other 2 pair.
4.0,it is ok needed to be leather stong enough to take my abuse but it will work
4.0,A little large--but super cute!
4.0,"I'm 5&#34;7, 140lbs and the small okay, but I wish it was just a little smaller.  It's a cute dress though, and I'm going to keep it."
4.0,"I am quite happy with the product. The chain was to long for me and not quit the quality, however for the price it was just fine."
4.0,I love it .this is for someone who love big bags. Very pleased
4.0,It looks nice but the fitting is very loose... size is perfect but the style is loose ...
4.0,"I love this top. Comfortable, you can dress it up or down, with tights or straight skirt or jeans. Looks great. Went back and bought a couple more colours."
4.0,"Fast shipment,my son loved it.Its very cute and fun....typical costume quality,which is not my favorite....but it was expected at the price."
4.0,"Love how it feels, but it fits smaller than expected."
4.0,They should be a little smaller.
4.0,I initially loved it but it tore after one wear. So a little disappointed. Going to try and sew it back.
4.0,"I really REALLY like it, it feels wonderful, looks very nice and I would purchase again, however, I didn't give it a 5-Star rating because the little snap strap to close the wallet needs to be longer, or expand somehow, because once you fill this wallet up, you can't snap it completely shut. Nothing falls out even if I can't snap it shut as it has lots of pockets and slots, so all is secure, even being tossed around in my large backpack style purse.  I got a relatively dark neutral color just to hide any dirt or marks it may get."
4.0,"I like the fit except for the arm length. Arm length could be a little longer for us tall girls, but other than that it's a nice lab coat."
4.0,The edges of the Velcro pieces are so sharp they WILL make you bleed if you’re not careful!
4.0,"After reading other comments I decided to order 2 sizes up from my typical size.  That was perfect!  Normally I'm a Medium, so I purchased an XL and it still fit very well but was looser and a little more &#34;flowy&#34; than it would have been.  I really like how subtle the designs are and how comfortable the material is.  I will definitely be able to wear them working out/running/and relaxing.  I will note that these shirts are fairly sheer.  You may want to wear another tank top underneath if you don't want them to be too see-through."
4.0,"Big cloth works well, once used up you have to replace"
4.0,Love the colors and how it fits. The only downside is the dang strap that pops up even if you tuck it inside the bathing suit.
4.0,"My husband loves this robe!  Soft, cozy, and attractive.  the robe had a slight chemical odor, probably from the dye used, and had to be laundered after the first wearing.  Other than that, it is a lovely robe."
4.0,Cute lightweight sweater. It does come with wrinkles that dont fall out just by hangi g but gone quickly with a few seconds in the dryer.
4.0,I love this dress and I bought it in the purple. The purple that I received is not the same color purple in the picture at all. But it is a pretty dress
4.0,"This band impresses me with the quality received for the price paid. The deployment buckle looks great and is easy to adjust; it matches my rose gold watch very well. The only reason I deducted a star is because of the relatively short length. I have an average size wrist (7½""), and the band just fits - with very little to slide under the collar.  Chinese manufacturers need to realize that they should make wearable items a little larger for U.S. export."
4.0,"Too casual for my work,  but cute dress. Didn't fit me as well up top as I'm not large ""there"""
4.0,I wear a size 15 shoe so a LARGE isn't quite so large for me but it does feel like my toes are staying warmer.  But who knows how much of that is the socks or just having on an extra pair of socks...  lol
4.0,This red lace dress is beautiful! It fit great for a larger bust and a bit of a belly. I'm 5 ft 3 161 lb. Can't wait for an opportunity to wear it.
4.0,"Very nice fit, light weight"
4.0,Was for a gift
4.0,"Nice shirt style but definitely runs on the small side. I got a medium and I normally fit medium (5’8, 145) but it feels like a small. As you can see in the pictures, it scrunches up in the tummy area (likely because it’s a bit small for my size). The fabric has some stretch and is very thin but it’s not see-through. If you’re looking for a warm, long-sleeved high quality shirt, this isn’t it. But if you’re ok with a fairly cheap, thin, tight sleeved shirt, then you’ve found your match."
4.0,"I took everyone's advice to order a size up (a large, hesitantly, as I've lost weight) and they were right. Fits like a medium. I'm 5'5&#34; 140 lbs w/ narrow hips. It's beautiful, not thin material, as I'd assumed. I'm not wild about the flare-out at the hips, like a little girl's dress. It can be easily sewn to fall in a straight line. It's shorter than the picture shows, but the longer back does end just below my butt, so it's tasteful... for my taste. :). Bought to wear with leggings and it'll be perfect."
4.0,Little small - one size up
4.0,I got loads of compliments on this when at burning man!  The wild fabric was a hit!
4.0,I ordered a side up and it fit perfectly.  So it may run a little bit small.  Great quality!
4.0,Nice but the deep cobalt blue color promised is not what I received - instead it's green.  I'd have left better feedback had it not taken so long to arrive. It's well made and the clasp and string are good quality. Definitely a nice mixture of epoxy and wood.
4.0,"I ordered a larger size, the bottom fits but top is a bit too large.  However, it is a beautiful dress.  I do not like the tie to the back of the dress, i will have it removed."
4.0,Turns skin green but that's no surprise.<br />I would just wear it for valentine's day!
4.0,"I love the dress however, took it out of the package and it fit perfectly but then I put it in the dryer, just to get the wrinkles out and the dress shrunk!!!  Very snug now."
4.0,Great product for the price.  My son lives them and wears them frequently.  We got several prints and they were all equal quality.
4.0,Love it. Super cute and comfy.
4.0,Dress is made true  to  the picture no surprises what you see is what you get .
4.0,The skirt is well made and the delivery was fast. The large is a bit too small. Pretty colors.
4.0,"Gave these as a gift and she loved them. They are VERY dainty, much smaller than I expected but she does not wear large earrings, so they were well received."
4.0,Bottom wasn’t as flared as I hoped. Perfect for a throwback look now as the style is coming back but I wanted a little more 70’s look for a party. Got a lot of compliments though!
4.0,WAS A GIFT FOR GRANDDAUGHTER...SHE LOVED THEM
4.0,I like these pajamas they feel comfy even though they aren’t satin. Material is soft. I take out 1 star because of the color. I bought gray but it looks more like brown but still like it and I’d like to buy more:)
4.0,"Very cute, good wood assortment, good price. I ended up with a size smaller than I wear, but I’m using them anyway."
4.0,I purchased this item in black color .The quality of the fabric can be improved a bit. However I ordered small size & the waist of this petticoat skirt fitted perfectly .
4.0,I like the material of the underwear but the bottom part is more roomy than the top band. Maybe sizing up would help if you have a belly. They are well made and have a nice variety of colors. The boyshort look is cute even though they are briefs.
4.0,It still fits today. Still looked new. I'm not complaining about the price.
4.0,"I used this for the 1st time on a trip to Florida.  It easily held all necessary items.  I like that besides hooking onto towel rod, it can also sit nicely on the counter."
4.0,"I’m pleasantly surprised that this dress fits well. A lot of these types of dresses are geared towards petite or average sized women, as a tall woman carrying some extra weight I did not expect much. It is a bit roomy in the chest area, but that’s not a big deal because it’s not terribly loose for me as I wear a C cup but almost need a D. However, a D or DD cup size should have no issues fitting nicely. Also the hem is short but not mini length. I feel feminine in this, not like an exhibitionist lol!"
4.0,"Usually a small. Had to order a large. The fit isn’t amazing, but for this price it’s okay. The front pouch is very flat so be prepared for your man to be flattened. If you have a big butt, order two sizes up."
4.0,I like the colors and style but for a 5T it’s a little big.
4.0,"Cute, nice fit, smelled awful"
4.0,"smaller than I expected , but I like it very much"
4.0,"The colors are as shown in the picture. They are comfortable and light weight, stacks nicely. I prefer these to the wider bands. Includes variety for styling."
4.0,Only default is that your your heavy chested as myself you need to use a safety pin to keep the puppies hidden.
4.0,Good quality.  The color fade a little after the first wash.  It is still good.  Made in China.
4.0,A little small for a 2 x but my grand daughter loves it.
4.0,I ordered a size bigger because reviews said it can be form fitting. It is very flowing and doesn't hug my curves. It's very soft and lightweight. Doesn't show my underclothes which is a plus.
4.0,It is comfortable and a good value
4.0,This is reasonably warm. It's fine under a hood but doesn't have much wind-proofing. The bill is just enough to keep drizzle out of my eyes and off my glasses. As long as there's little wind. It's light and packable.
4.0,They are a lot bigger and much heavier than I thought they were going to be.
4.0,"Its smaller, cute, and exactly what you get for a sweater with shoulders exposed."
4.0,It was a little to loose I should have ordered a size smaller. I love the feel though
4.0,Ordered a xl a little big so reordered in a large it's ture to size I like the open look better  can't wait to receive my new order I'm 5'4 180
4.0,Color is way brighter and less burgundy looking but it fits well. Looks good and is flattering. Wanted it to be a little sheer so that’s perfect
4.0,Really cute but I wish it was shinier or more of a Sterling silver finish.  It looks more like pewter than anything with kind of a dull like finish.
4.0,Like how it looks but have not worn it yet.
4.0,"Bought 2 one blue, one green. Love the softness. Love the design. They come to the waste exactly where supposed to. The problem I have is the length of arms.  I'm 4'11"", petite the end of arms are imo 2"" too long and that's at minimum. For some may need them even shorter. I'm thinking of trying somehow pulling up sleeve to white pattern at least 2"" and sewing little areas with notches. Hopefully it won't look weird because I really like these sweater tops. If anyone has ideas I'm open to read."
4.0,"The colors and the brilliance of these earrings are great! I bought them for my sister's birthday and they just sparkle like crazy! They did not come on earring cards (just in tiny plastic bags per pair), so I found an old necklace box and altered it to enhance the presentation. My only wish beyond that would be to have had a shade of blue instead of the black stone. Definitely a steal for 8 blingy pairs of earrings!"
4.0,"for the price what do you expect five Poncho..... for real emergency, used them in France on the bike trip"
4.0,Thicker material than expected. Looks like the picture
4.0,They are missing the  Adjustable Closure Per the description . But I am still happy with the band . It still has a Velcro closure which I like compared to a metal closure. I wear my Apple Watch 12 plus hours a day and having a band that is comfortable is important. These bands are comfortable .
4.0,"I bought a Large and I am a 38C and size 12/14 dress.  I didn't have time to order an XL to see if that would work for me.  My guess is that the XL would have been a little too big.  I just fall in that in between size.<br /><br />This dress was a little snug around my ribs.  Not to the point of not being able to move but definitely small enough that it was hard to zip up.  The neckline is really low and I am uncomfortable going without a bra.  Finding a bra that worked and held me in the dress took a bit of effort.<br /><br />However, this dress is extremely flattering and I am happy with the purchase.  It is very well made.  The price for the quality is really really good."
4.0,"Update: the vendor contacted me immediately and gave great customer service. She assured me that the smell will go away and even promised to work with the manufacturer to try to change materials. So I updated my review to 4 stars for their great customer service. As soon as the smell is gone, I will gladly rate it five stars because the quality and style of the travel bag is great. First review: This bag arrived yesterday. The quality of the sewing and the material is really good. If it were for that alone I would rate it 5 stars. The one big problem is the smell. The smell makes it unusable. It has a strong, awful chemical smell. I thought I could just air it out but it stunk up my house so I had to try washing it. I ran it through a washing machine cycle and the odor was still there. I ran it for a second cycle and I can kind of smell the laundry detergent behind the chemical smell. So I'm about to run it for a third cycle hoping that will do the trick. If the odor does go away, I'll change my rating to 5 stars. Otherwise it is useless because I would never pack this inside my luggage to make everything else smell like it. I wonder if the smell came from the fabric itself and maybe how it is dyed because it does have deep rich colors, which look good. Just need to get rid of the smell."
4.0,"Is this the best Halloween costume? No. But for the price is it a good deal? And is it decent? Yes.  It annoyed me a little that it did not come with any instructions or documentation of any kind. But then again, it’s a Halloween costume so….  The facemask is kind of generic, and I did not use it.  But the rest is pretty solid and looks pretty good.  It’s a costume good for a party, but wouldn’t be very durable.  If purchased for the right reason, I would recommend."
4.0,I was recommended this product from a friend. She said my daughter would love it and she was right. Everything was perfect for my unicorn moving 2 year old. She carries the bag around daily and calls the skirt her princess skirt. She does the best twirls in it.<br />I felt like the price was reasonable for everything I received. The only reason I gave it four stars is because the pants are thin. But we love everything else and it’s all great quality.
4.0,Love this blouse! This blouse is by far one of my favorite things to wear now when its warm outside. Love that it is light weight and not a heavy material. The color is better that I was expecting it is a pretty sea foam green color. The blouse also has accent buttons on the top that are brown. The fit is better than I was expecting the blouse wasn't too long fit just right. Highly recommend!
4.0,This is a great suit. It is flattering on the body as a one piece. Highly recommend.
4.0,"Ok, this dress is super cute. I'm 5'9 and it sits at right above my knee. So good for work and I dont have to wear leggings. I'm just not a big fan of the material. It's kinda like costume stretchy material. My boyfriend loves it and I feel cute in it!"
4.0,Makes it easier to breath but difficult when you need to drink something while working.
4.0,"It fits me the way a shirt should fit!! In the future I would by a size larger just so I can wear it with tights! Other than that, Love the shirt. Getting lots of compliments on it while at work."
4.0,"I found that the dress hung better without the sash, but that's no problem. The fabric is light, cool and comfortable, and the print is really pretty. If it had pockets, it would be perfect!"
4.0,Bought an XXL for my size 10/12 daughter and it was way too small.  She really liked the fabric though and it seemed well made.  Also not totally long sleeve - more like 3/4 length.
4.0,"I did not rate 5 stars for 2 reasons:<br />1) The seller sent a note with the package and emailed me a few days after delivery requesting the screws be tightened, but did not include the screw driver.<br />2) The clasp feels like a cheap plastic.<br /><br />With that being said, after 2 weeks of full time wear the gold band is still as beautiful as the day I got it and is not falling apart (I am not rough with it and do not wear it too tight). So far, I'd recommend and would buy again."
4.0,"Nothing fancy; just an accurate, functional timepiece at a remarkably low price."
4.0,I really like this shirt. It’s for a them day at work so the fact it’s a little thin isn’t a bad thing. The cut around where the sleeves attach to the main shirt part is a bit snug but not uncomfortable enough to not wear.
4.0,"I love the hat, but when it come folded, it does not provide instructions on how to get the creases out. This is important as it is a folding hat and you will need to know this. I still don't know! However, it is beautiful and big!"
4.0,"If you have a small wrist, this bracelet will def fall off. I have it on the tightest it will go and it is still loose on me. Otherwise, I love it."
4.0,"I love the feel of the material, the fit is spot on (I got a 2XL I am 5 ft 2"" and over 200 lbs). I thought it would be a brighter blue, but it is a nice ""blue jean"" type of a blue which I love. The material is soft and appears to be well made. I don't like taking photos of myself so not including one on this review. I am super happy with this top and will get a lot of use out of it!"
4.0,"I really like this military, waterproof watch.<br />Nice, comfortable band and good looks of the face of the watch make this a very good bargain. I will definitely be buying more products from this company."
4.0,good quality. have no way to test the RFID protection.
4.0,Got it while it was on sale on prime day and used it for 6 months. Its very hard and sturdy and does all that it advertises. It's a little bulky for me though and since I only have 3 cards and no cash to put in it I'll probably go back to a smaller wallet.
4.0,"Was a little big Bigger than expected,  but  it was just as pictured"
4.0,"Obviously not top quality, but great for this very stylish stay at home mom!!!"
4.0,Great items for the prize box.
4.0,"Very nice material but thin, ordered a size up."
4.0,"The quality of the design and materials is excellent, but I didn’t see as much improvement in my night vision as hoped."
4.0,"Fits nicely,  light weight and attractive. Used only one time during weather of about 28 degrees. It worked fine for me but it may be your region of weather. The reviews are good and a reasonable price."
4.0,Very pretty but just a tad too long for me.
4.0,"It's a higher quality costume than some packaged costumes I have purchased; I was pleasantly surprised.  It only took a few little easy alterations to make it fit me better (darts up top and shortening the length of the dress).  I also painted a few more designs on the mask.  The mask didn't impede breathing though I wouldn't wear it while driving because it does block some peripheral vision.  Since I wore the costume to work, I had a black long sleeved v-neck knit shirt on under it, and it still looked good.  The dress could easily be used for other costumes with just a change of accessories (stick on a witch hat and be a witch or a robe and a staff and be a sorceress...).  I received several compliments on the costume.  The only problem I had wasn't anything to do with the costume but people not knowing about Egyptian deities--I kept having to explain that I wasn't Catwoman, but was the goddess Bastet who &lt;i> gave&lt;/i> Catwoman her awesome abilities!"
4.0,"Size was a little small, but quality is high."
4.0,"Nice medium weight, which makes it perfect for wearing under a jacket when outside, then looking fine by itself when inside. I wish it had pockets, though. Otherwise, just dandy. I wear a medium size, and it fits nicely, slim through the waist."
4.0,"I have been wearing silicone rings for over a year now and I am a big fan.  In fact, my wedding ring is made of silicone.  Due to years of damage that I had done to my knuckles playing rugby, it was impossible for me to have a ring fit over my knuckle and then not be extremely loose on my finger.  These are the perfect solution.<br /><br />I wanted to get his set of 4 so that I could rotate my rings and make them last longer. In case you thought otherwise, silicone rings of ANY brand will stretch and discolor over time.<br /><br />Compared to other brands I have tried, these rings ran the smallest.  Not a big deal for me as I like them snug!  When I say snug, I mean that these would not rotate on my finger without some effort because they were that close to the skin.  If you like it looser than that, you should order a size larger than normal.<br /><br />That being said, these rings are comfortable, look good, and will definitely be the center of some conversations if you wear them.  People are amazed with the concept.<br /><br />I agree completely with the other reviewer...&#34;Are they the best silicone rings money can buy? No but they are the best value in silicone rings.&#34;<br /><br />I received these rings at a discounted price in exchange for an honest review of the product."
4.0,Was very skeptical but installed in my jordans played today they worked great. These are only if you take a cart NOT for the walkers out there they will get worn out to quickly and good luck trying to replace the spikes.
4.0,Nice lightweight hoodie. I do think the material could be just a little thicker but it is comfortable. I do have one negative though.  The zippers on the sides annoy me. If you don't have anything on underneath this they'll rub against the side of your body and I just don't like that feeling.
4.0,"95 yr old father looking for long-sleeved polo with pocket. Perfect.  Came in timeline promised, but especially slow shipping."
4.0,"I only give it 4 stars because it's very clingy and runs a bit small. But it is very lightweight and comfortable. It feels something like dry-fit material. The turtle neck doesn't stand up too high, which I like. The neck also doesn't choke me like some turtlenecks do."
4.0,Very nice quality thick and large. Colors are a little better in the picture than in person but still happy with this purchase. This scarf really does provide warmth and is best for colder winter days. As a shawl by itself it would be great for fall or winter. I was very surprised at how large this scarf is I have bought other online scarfs and been disappointed by how small they were but this one was true to size.
4.0,"Very nice,but very difficult to change the size⌚️"
4.0,"Works like it's supposed to, but the white color is not very bright...fyi."
4.0,"Update - I order this item in August for our December Wedding. I finally got the man's ring exchanged for the correct size about two months later. The rings are nice and a heavy material. I do think the first ring shipped was completely the wrong size. He couldn't even slide it on his finger, we went up one size and it fell off. We had a heck of a time getting this company to agree to another return. They finally said yes we shipped the ring and they claimed never to receive it. I had to open a claim with amazon to get them to finally ship the correct size. Nice ring but their customer service is lacking and you have to strong arm them to agree to do a return. They only agreed if I would remove bad feedback."
4.0,"I bought a few dresses for a casual outdoor wedding. this dress fits great and love the cut. it's close to 90 degrees where I live and this material is a thicker, shiny poly material. I think it'd be too warm."
4.0,Fits a little small but really cute
4.0,Not for tall people.
4.0,It’s just a little to long in the body. The pockets need to be higher for my shape. A petite would have been perfect.
4.0,"Fits great after I resized the band. It’s a little tedious removing links, but can be done if patient, with minimal wear on the flaps of each link. I often receive compliments because the finish looka closet to the aluminum sport 44mm S4 I chose. This band also looks professionally fitted. My only feedback is that the band connector is not snug, it clicks into place but does have some space to wiggle, unlike OEM bands."
4.0,Love it. It does run smaller after washing.  Had to unbutton the sleeves.  So comfortable. It's like sleeping with a extra sheet! I  will be ordering another.
4.0,Does honor the soldier
4.0,"Love it!  I have not washed the shirt, not sure how it will turn out.  I am 5'3, size 8 and ordered a small - perfect fit.  I would purchase again."
4.0,"It's a nice pair of leggings, and they seem warm. They're not as warm as I'd like to be (they're not thermo warm, but great for at home), but they are definitely thicker than regular leggings and much warmer. It's just that they were too small, otherwise I would've kept them! But even as a shorter person and not to heavy, I'd say I'm average to skinny? It was way to tight everywhere, it was like wearing compression socks but for my entire lower half lol."
4.0,Good shades real dark and fit well
4.0,A great stocking stuffers.
4.0,"There is a nose piece that goes across the bridge of your nose so you can adjust the mask to fit better, it's comfy and now with the pandemic I have a good excuse to wear this out all the time. Love it.  I'm not a cosplayer I just like the look of the mask and yes this one dose glow in the dark but not for very long, you get maybe 5-7 minutes but holy crap can it glow bright if you use direct sunlight on it then go into a dark or dim room."
4.0,"Pretty good, were a little small but then again I have a big head."
4.0,"I thought it was a little too lose, and long. Still great for louning around. Plus I am on the smaller size, so it might just be me. I am 5'2"" and 115lbs, if that helps anyone."
4.0,Took a while to receive product. they are very nice. Would order again
4.0,"I ordered this for my honeymoon and it was very cute and soft. The only issue is that the top is very short, like crop top length. I ordered a small and it all fit as expected except the length in the top. Otherwise a cute set of pajamas."
4.0,Nice mediun jacket.
4.0,The fit is just odd. I got a small like always an it saga in the waist
4.0,very good comfort  a little heavy for hot weather but I think worth the support they give
4.0,"Some of these we had a hard time getting the adhesive tape off, so we ended up throwing a few away. However we loved these. We used them for our Mustache day at school for Dr. Suess week. Definitely will be purchasing again! Loved the quantity and variety... I was able to share with coworkers and my class!"
4.0,"came to amazon for this product after local stores in the fall had run out of ballet leotards as the season of classes began, so, as all clothes bought on-line, no opportunity to try it on.  it is great, washes well and after 4 or 5 weeks of constant washing, maintains its elasticity and color.  only problem is the sizing listed as from 2-6x.  my daughter just turned 5, and she is an itty bitty tiny 5, she mostly wears 3t-4t (except pants where she needs 5t for length). so, if your little one is an average 5t or beyond, I wouldn't recommend this size, go up one."
4.0,"cute just not sure if it will last, chain doesn't seem very strong."
4.0,"I ordered this dress to wear on New Year’s Eve (with a little black Fascinator, also from Amazon). I was thrilled when I tried it on and found the lace to be so soft! I weigh about 198 lb, and I ordered an xxl. It fit perfectly, not tight, but with hardly any ease. I am 42” bust, and it fit snugly but not tight across the chest. Neckline did not gap. I have large upper arms, and even the sleeves fit comfortably. I am 5’8” and the dress came to lower calf, about 4-6” above my ankle. The lace is not the cheap type of nylon stretch lace that pulls and snags easily. It is expensive looking, high-quality lace. Lining is a nice weight, woven lining material, not sheer at all. I stood in front of a glass door, and my husband said he could not see through the dress.<br /><br />Minus one star because the back bodice lining does not come up high enough to cover my bra. With a nude color bra, it isn’t too noticeable, but not acceptable if you don’t want your bra showing through the lace at all. The skirt has more of a straight silhouette, and does not flare out much at the bottom as shown (model is holding the skirt out to make it looked more flared.) The zipper seems a bit delicate, so I will be gentle with it when zipping up the dress, just in case.<br /><br />Overall, very happy with this purchase!<br /><br />Other tha"
4.0,O love them
4.0,"Beautiful purse! Not too large, plenty of room and storage pockets. Strong, beautiful color. Only complain is the name plate on from was put on upside down. Will have to fix."
4.0,Love it. It fits well and it very nicely made. Need someone to help tie the back tight though
4.0,Love this suit!! Good quality. Love that I can wear the top with other bottoms & mix/match. I ordered an XL and just because I would like the bottoms to go a bit higher on my waist I would order one size up.
4.0,I really like the ring and tried to buy a few more but they are out of stock.
4.0,This is my first attempt at a turban & was hoping it would fit over pins etc. looks good on & does expand some on short hair etc.<br />Very nice buy!
4.0,NICE SET
4.0,I exercist in them
4.0,"I finally took this out on a powder day with heavy snowfall all day long.<br /><br />Fit: I got the small and I normally wear medium jackets. Glad I went down a size because I know snowboard jackets are fairly baggy if not slim fit. So for me it fit perfect. I am short so it does run a little long on me. (I'm 5'4). Even though I went a size down I was still able to layer. So fit is great for me. The only thing that was not up to par was the hood. It would be good if you didn't wear a helmet, but I do and this sucker was locked tight once the hood was up and the zipper fully up. I don't know what it is with snowboard jackets and hoods. They just don't make them the way they should. No flexibility. Even my buddy has to take his zipper down on his jacket just to get some head movement when the hood is up and I have to do the same thing.<br /><br />Waterproofing : I've already taken this jacket 11 days up the mountain and the biggest test was a heavy snow storm mixed with powder runs all day! In short I was dry. Didn't even notice any moisture.<br /><br />Anyways. Love the jacket. It's made well. Has enough pockets. Keeps me dry. But even though the hood does it's job in keeping you warm and dry, your head movement is very restricted and I had to loosen up my zipper to compensate for it."
4.0,"It is is a very practical product and a good size, but does not feel like leather and it doesn't look too great."
4.0,"So far so good, fits tight with wraps, and I  have small hands, but seems good quality.  I use them 3-4times a week for boxing and kick boxing on the heavy bag.  Well see how they hold up after a year and then I'll do another review."
4.0,Cheaply made but looks really cute and nice!
4.0,"I thought this dress was very cute in the pictures online. I purchased the yellow dress with white polka dots. In person the yellow is not as vibrant; its a light yellow. The material of the dress is also very thin. It's not what I was expecting, but it's still an ok dress."
4.0,I like it because you can wear on your neck and not have to search your purse for a mask.
4.0,"It’s super thin, You can see through it.  I  thought it would be thicker. I’m glad I got a good deal on it, otherwise I would be sending it back.<br />Don’t expect it to be a warm sweater on a cold day, you’ll be disappointed."
4.0,"Very soft and comfortable. I would wear these everyday, look good too. Working a job where I Sat a lot, I experienced frequent wedgies."
4.0,Comfortable fit and true to size.
4.0,This was extremely large. My granddaughter wears a 7-8 and it hung to her ankles. I had someone alter it and it did work well for her poodle skirt for the Christmas Program.
4.0,"I love the pockets. I wish the hemline was straight across, rather than the sides being a little higher. But thats a small preference. Its a very comfortable and flattering dress."
4.0,"I was surprised by the quality by such a low price. The bottom sole was much firmer than expected so I hoped they would last a while. Unfortunately, I returned them because they were too small for my daughter. It's her normal size in several brands including Target, Walmart, and Old Navy."
4.0,I love these! They fit perfect and have great stretch! I love the feeling of the material!
4.0,"feels great, fits well, just noticed that the material balls up quicker than some of the others but well worth the price and comfort"
4.0,"Seem well made, fit my 8 year olds well, definitely protect well.  But one of them (Bigger than avg for 8) complained the band put a little too much pressure on his head.  So 8 might be the upper limit for age range."
4.0,"First and foremost, this is very pretty. Also, I was surprised to find that it includes the bottoms as well as the shirt, so it is an entire bathing suit. I don’t think that’s explained very well in their title or item description.<br /><br />They also sent a “bonus” of a bathing cap. It is a different fabric and print, with totally different colors, and it clashes - still okay, since it’s a bonus!<br /><br />The top is very pretty. The design is beautiful - just as shown in the photos, and I love that the bottom of it can be adjusted for different styles. There is no support to it, however, so it did not flatter my apple shaped belly.<br /><br />I found the chest cups odd. I wear a C cup, and bought an XL, but these were way too small to fit me. In fact, that whole bra area seemed too high up on my body. The cups landed squarely in between my shoulders and my chest.. They are removable, so it could work with a sports bra.<br /><br />The bottoms are shown in one of the seller’s photos above. They fit well.<br /><br />Overall this is nice, especially for someone with a slimmer body."
4.0,"I Liked everything about this top except the length, it just wasn’t long enough for me!"
4.0,"Loved this tote, however I did return it because it was bigger than I expected."
4.0,I ordered it 3 sizes larger
4.0,"I ordered the Moana T-Shrits for my twin daugters who are huge fans of this Disney movie. The shirts fit true to size for my average size 3 year olds. I did however place the T-shirts into the dryer after washing them, and the graphics on the front of the shirts started to stick together. besides that one issue the shirts where just fine for the price."
4.0,Bought this for my grand daughter to wear now but it's a little large for her. It will be fine for next year though. Still a cute outfit. Can't wait to see her in it.
4.0,It’s heavy. Looks good.
4.0,"Cute dress, good fit overall. I did return however because it was thin material and I was looking for something for the cold weather. Would be great for a warmer climate or for spring here on the east coast  :)"
4.0,"~32W/32L good fit, warm but not too warm. Didn't use these to run in or anything, just for camping. Plus they look dope as hell."
4.0,"My son is 21 and 6'4"" with autism and loves having a tight layer under his clothes. The fit on this was good, giving the right amount of compression, and it was well made. Where it fell a bit short is with the length with him being so tall."
4.0,I really like these gloves. Not too thick but not too thin. The thickness is equivalent to a McDavid neoprene ankle brace. I’ve worn them in 30-35 degree weather and was fine. But I don’t recommend it at that temperature for an extended period of time. No issues with touch screen use. Only complaint is the red logo but that’s just a personal preference. I have slim hands and bought a medium and it fits perfectly (zipped and unzipped). Not long or wide.
4.0,"Great looking, warm coat. A little cheaply made as lining is tearing, but I'm still mostly happy with it."
4.0,"I absolutely adore the thick, strongn velvety fabric of the solid hot pink pair I have. By contrast my satin dyed pair arrived today and split across the front of my thigh during my very first workout. The fabric on this pair is definitely thinner and smoother. A different fabric altogether. I only recommend the solid colors."
4.0,"I'm 5'5"" 135lbs with athletic build and normally wear a size small/size 4. I ordered a large and it is still tight on my chest and through waist. Plus, it's shaped weird up top and the shoulder straps are long. Fortunately, I plan to wear it for workouts with a sports bra under it so I don't mind it being tight. Material is thin but the glitter Wonder Woman design is nice."
4.0,Cute little ornament. Kinda cheap and the details are muddled.
4.0,A nice shirt.  This was great. Nice style and color was exactly what I expected.
4.0,I wear a us size 16 The XL fits comfortably. This dress is sooooo Cute 😍❤️ get it u won't regret it.  Also the material is wonderfully soft and airy.. Great Summer Sundress
4.0,They are very comfortable and fit great
4.0,"I found the best results to be driving in the rain during the day on the highway. The glasses seem to double your ability to see down the road in the rain. Night driving it helped to reduce the glare of on coming headlight and your night vision. I sent a pair to my daughter in Chicago, hopefully they will help while driving threw the faling snow. The glasses definitely make it safer, and less stressful will driving in the rain I give them a five for rain."
4.0,Looked really great on my daughter! The pants were a bit to long so the bottoms got messed up... but she got so many  complements on it!
4.0,Love it a little too tight on me I am 5'3 and 130 and chose size 6 I will recommend * if you want it like that picture
4.0,Very soft and comfy . Great  buy for the  cost!
4.0,"This necklace is super cute.  You can adjust the length of the necklace which is really nice.  The earrings are cute but I haven't worn them yet. The chain is gold, but not a tacky gold.  You get what you pay for - it's not the most expensive-looking jewelry, but I still like it."
4.0,"I like the belt overall and it is exactly what I wanted and looks just like the pictures.  However, the sizes on the listing are just simply wrong.  I have a 33” waist and normal get belts that are 36”.  I ordered a Medium because the listing said Mediums fit waists up to 38”; however, the belt barely fits around me.  I can close the belt on the very last set of holes and it’s a bit tight.  I wish I would have known, as I would’ve ordered a size up and gone with a Large."
4.0,I have had this wallet now for a few days and love it! It seems to be a decent quality as far as holding up! I have an iPhone 6S Plus and with no case my phone does fit in the zipper part! That to me is super great alone because it's hard to find a wallet that can fit this big phone! The one and only thing I would change about this is that it would be nice to have the option of a little cord that you could use to carry it! The color is very pretty! It has a lot of space for all of my cards! I would totally recommend this product to anyone!
4.0,"This dress is made of a thinner material and the stitching is average. It is comfortable, the length is great, and it has pockets. It could be a nice option for casual outings in the spring or summer but nothing fancy."
4.0,Love these skirts! They are long and comfy. Thin and lightweight material that flows.  Perfect for every day use. I wear skirts every day and these are the most comfortable maxi skirt I have had in years. Definitely gonna be buying more in different colors. Only drawback is because of the thinner material you can’t put a whole lot in the pockets or the skirt will start pulling down. They are not see through though.
4.0,"Bought it for my daughter's 8th grade promotion, very pretty but the dress was not as long as shown in photo. She is only 5'3 and the length was to her shins."
4.0,"These are very well made and look great. They are very low cut and are barely visible when wearing sneakers. I Love the color and the graphics. I was surprised that they are literally marked for right and left feet and if you look close, you’ll see that they’re cut slightly different too. I wear a men’s size 9.5 and I find these a little on the snug size but they stretch a lot and have a nice cushy bottom. These will be great for summer and I’ll be seen in them often!"
4.0,Very sparkly and shiny. Bought it to hold a rose gold pendant that is decent sized. Seemed like a finer chain than I expected judging from a .9mm box chain I've recently purchased.....is holding up ok despite weight of pendant.
4.0,This charm is great and in great quality.  I love these charms as they can be warn with anything and anywhere.  They tell the story of memories and experiences!
4.0,"The crop top is just regular, smooth t-shirt material. The bottom of the shirt is a curved down cut (5 1/2 inches at the seam to 9 1/4 inches down the middle) with a scalloped whipstitch without piping like the neckline or shoulders."
4.0,"I wear this belt everyday with my holster, cuffs and extra magazines.  Comfortable and sturdy.  I'm not a huge fan of the carbon pattern, but it's hardly noticeable.  We will see if it holds up as I've only been using it for a few weeks."
4.0,Shirt runs a slight bit small but not bad for the money could be a little softer
4.0,It fit well.  The hem was uneven.  I still needed ti take it to a shop to get a gew things altered on it but it fits beautiful .
4.0,Great gift for my bike loving hubs who is an inspired bicycle mechanic novice.
4.0,"I put my ipad , purse, i phone and a tissue. And it was hatd to close it. It was heavy as well. So I returned it."
4.0,Its a very nice watch. I use it as an every day horse and ita great.  Good size and weight and gotta love the pepsi bezzel.  Looks loke a high end Seiko or even Rollie to the untrained eye.  Strap is a bit weak thats an easy fix.  Well worth the 70 bucks.... Gonna tell people the msrp was 200 ; )
4.0,Fit but little too exact... also slightly shrunk...
4.0,"Good for the price, although the material is really delicate."
4.0,Warm and cuddly! Super soft and fit perfect. It does get super staticky but that’s probably my dry house!
4.0,I LOVE this leo!  I wore it for my senior pictures for dance and they turned out amazing!
4.0,"I really like this St Christopher medal/keychain. I particularly like the message on back saying I’m a Catholic, in case of accident call a priest. I would order it again."
4.0,"I wear a 8.5 in women's which is a 6.5 in youth... I ordered the 7 and they were still somewhat tight. I like them, so I'll keep them anyway."
4.0,"These have held up better than I thought, so pretty durable. Not very warm, tough."
4.0,perfect workout tops
4.0,Great for volleyball players.
4.0,great project to lose some extra pounds
4.0,"Really irritated because I've never wanted a dress more. Bought a large and it was too big so immediately ordered a medium. Got it in today and it was a large. I thought i made a mistake. Was gonna order again, or the medium in my cart, went to check out...says large. I have never wanted a dress more in my life but good Lord i give up."
4.0,My dad bought this dress for me and I intended to wear it on Easter Sunday.  The material was soft and smooth and the fit was really good.  The reason I returned this item was because the very top piece of material was folded over and you could see shades of the pattern behind the first layer.  It looked more like you could see a pattern on my bra than a doubled layer of material.  It was 'the only' thing I didn't like.  It was a toss up but ultimately my mom and I decided to return the dress.  I really wish the underneath layer was a solid color but that would probably increase the price of the dress.
4.0,"Bought these for a combo of school spirit day (green) and camp color war. Kids just wore the green and other than the feather popping out, they were great and cheap. I’m sure the quality of the $5 per item would be much better, but I wasn’t going to spend that much."
4.0,The sizes are really hard i have ordered first pair was to big 2  pair ordered 5.5 got 5 cm this pair two small I really love the shoe just need to work on size I need a half size bigger daughter is getting up set she wanted them in before her dance on Feb 5th but if I return the 2nd pair to get size bigger they want be in till Feb to march to long to wait love shoe's so please help us
4.0,A bit thin but not bad overall
4.0,"Good products. It's smaller than I expected, but the children loved it."
4.0,My son wears a toddler size 10 shoe so we got size 10 and they are a little big. I'm not complaining though because the strap can be tightened to keep them on. Only down side is the insoles fall out
4.0,"I really liked the look of this purse, however, both bags that I received, the strap was backwards on the one side. This may not be an issue for some people but I’m somewhat of a perfectionist so it bothered me & I had to return them both!! 😊😊"
4.0,Beautiful watch.  The band is large.
4.0,"Good looking watch, but the material used for the band is certainly cheap. It will run a little fast, but nothing more than about 30 seconds on the day. It takes about 25 winds to get it fully 'charged.' The skeleton insides are absolutely beautiful, though!"
4.0,liked the shirt but had to send it back for a larger size as I didn't want it to cling in the middle
4.0,I really like the purse. I just now started carrying it today. At first I thought it would be to small.But after I got everything in the more I like it.I only have 2 complaints first the zipper is kind of hard to zip. The other is I'm paying I think 138 for it. Now I see where's the price is down to 131. Other then that I do love the purse. Glad I decided not to return it. I would highly recommend it.
4.0,As pretty as a clear fanny pack can be.
4.0,The little compartments could have been bigger but it was good for my small collection
4.0,The charm was a little smaller than I thought and hole too small for me to thread jute through it. I use them as charms hanging from my bottle decor. Overall excellent product price just too small for my decor.
4.0,It's a good product. Not too much great expectations.
4.0,Very cool Gloves! My three year old had no problem putting them on. They did slide off occasionally but for the price they are an awesome touch to complete the hulk costume!
4.0,I stand up a lot in my work. The Compression Socks fit nice and tight.
4.0,"Was a little small, which was surprising because my daughter is so small. You may want to order up a size. Super cute, though!"
4.0,Thought it was too short for me.  Lovely but returned
4.0,Fits as expected. Really nice feel. Comfortable.
4.0,Pretty expensive for as simple of a design. It works. It’s soft.
4.0,"This is a very sexy and elegant swimming suit. It looks exactly like the pictures. The material is okay, better than what I expected. I'm a 38 DDD and this one covers my boobs well. I normally order XL but because I have big boobs, I preferred to not take any risks, and so I went one size up XXL. This swimming suit accentuated my hourglass shape very nice."
4.0,"Definitely smaller than the normal sizes, but the Seller did mention that.  I gave it as a gift, and she loves it."
4.0,"I like this two tone color and it is nice, comfortable and washes nicely"
4.0,They are pretty generic and they are floppy. they don;t stand up right as the sales picture suggests. They have a strong plastic odor that wears off eventually. Usually size 13 works for me but with these boots the problem was not the actually shoe of it but trying to slip into it. A bit of a struggle to get past the bend into the shoe!
4.0,"It was just what I expected and that was fine.  Well packaged, etc."
4.0,"Easy to wear, dress up or down.  Extremely comfortable.  Have not washed it yet...we will see."
4.0,"It was different than what I expected. It's a piece of fabric folded in half with the ends sewn leaving a hole at the top of each end for your arms. It is unusual, but I like it."
4.0,when in doubt order a size up!!... should have listened to my gut... and the reviews... rather tight on the arms... but a nice shirt had I ordered a bigger size then normal
4.0,Its very cute but I guess I was expecting grandma unicorn to not be so.... sexy?... the other ones that I had seen came off more funny and silly. It seems that is made of good quality material but unfortunately it's not really what I was looking for so I'll probably returning this
4.0,LA basics women's loose fit babydoll crew neck tunic dress.  This dress/shirt is made of rayon and spandex.  It is recommended that it be hand washed with cold water and hung to dry.  It can be dry cleaned.  It is a slip on style with short sleeves and a scooped neckline.  It features a ruffled hem.  This dress/shirt arrived on time and was packaged in a clear bag.  I ordered an xxxl in the color fuchsia.  The material is super soft and flowy.  I do not think it could be a dress on me.  It's a bit too short.  It looks great with a pair of yoga carpi pants though.  The xxxl is pretty large on me as I did order a few sizes larger than I should.  I paired this with a belt under the bust and it helps a lot.  I may have to alter the back to pull it tighter as it is too flowy.  The ruffled bottom is cute and if I wore it as a dress I'm sure that would look really nice but I just can't bring myself to wear such a short dress.  I'm not tall at all but it hits high on my legs and I couldn't bend over ever if I wore it as a dress.  Overall I like this tunic dress/shirt but it's not a dress on me and I have to alter it if I want it to fit me (but that's on me for ordering such a large size).<br /><br />I received this product for free or at a discount.  The only requirement was that I give an honest review.  There is no reward for a positive review and no punishment for a negative review.  This was my honest opinion of the product.  I only accept a free or discounted product if I or my family will use the item and want the item.  I know that I rely on other reviews prior to purchasing an item and I hope that you found this review helpful.
4.0,Reason for not giving a 5 star is cause it was damaged the Velcro was coming off. Other wise nice.
4.0,Nice belt.  Appropriate look for semi formal or casual.  Easy to trim and resize!
4.0,"Very nice, a little bit thinner than I thought it would be but still very nice, received earlier than expected ship date."
4.0,"Just would like to comment on the quality of service I received regarding this product.  I ordered this lovely thing back in December and I suppose it was lost somewhere. I waited three months and then I decided to &quot;contact seller.&quot; I spoke to someone named Monica who was super sweet and nice and this product was resent. It is now late march and I finally received it about a week ago. Very satisfied, despite the long wait. It is very lovely, and much more dainty and delicate looking than I expected. I wear it all the time now"
4.0,"Love the design, not too heavy. Simply elegant. Too tight but plan to add cord or chain for personal fit comfort. Matching earrings were a surprise!.  If you love fashion jewelry, you'll  love this."
4.0,Very nice strap. Easy to change.
4.0,"Simple steel, delicate pretty, quality matches price"
4.0,"My daughter loves this suit.  It looks good, fits great, and super cute."
4.0,wrapped well - just as they appear
4.0,My husband now wants one
4.0,Fairly good Quality T-Shirt ❣️  Normal sizing will be Accurate
4.0,"The reason I’m at 4 stars is because the small was still wide on the hips and you may need some white undergarments to complete the look. The level of “see through” for this white dress is 9/10. You can get away with nude or white under. As for versatility… GO FOR IT. This dress can fit all body types I’d think, the stretch is great and the material is soft. If I bought it again, probably a pink or lavender for summer time. It’s more of a classy and comfy combo for a picnic day or baby shower.<br />Overall, 4/5 ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️.<br />Super cute and easy on the eyes. I feel like a tea time princess. Super happy with the way this allows me to move, yet hugs my butt.<br />Happy Shopping 🛍️"
4.0,Overall I like the sweater! It’s comfy and true to size. It does not fall off the shoulder as pictured. I’d have to really stretch it to do that. But keeping because I like the overall sweater.
4.0,I am able to pair and accessorize this dress with a variety of things and can switch up the style. It is versatile and can easily be switched from casual to semi casual wear.
4.0,Perfect lightweight bag
4.0,I got these for my VCH piercing. Yes I know they are for eye brows but I also seen where other customers used it for their VCHs. To me the barbell is small for this type of piercing. It’s comfortable but the bottom ball keeps the hood pulled back because the barbell is shorter than I expected. I like this set but it’s not really made for a VCH piercing.
4.0,I love the shoes.  They are very comfortable but they make farting noises when I walk in them.  I thought it would go away the more I wore them but that hasn't happened.
4.0,"Fit perfectly and they are very stylish, got compliments on them all day."
4.0,Was a little big for 16 month old but great for a -13 degree morning
4.0,Nice dress for the price. The top was a little roomy and it's quite structured/
4.0,"I’d order a size down from what you’re used to ordering, other than that they’re quite comfortable. I bought them for jogging/walking, but I wouldn’t wear them hiking because they’re very thin and feel as if one thorny bush would rip them wide open.<br /><br />I wish the drawstring was a little more substantial, but I’ll be looking to order something similar in the near future."
4.0,I like the look of no gaps.<br />But not so comfortable to wear to bed when I was monitoring my sleep but all day wear no problem.
4.0,Cute. Haven't worn them yet . A little bigger than I thought but perfect for holiday season.
4.0,My son is 4 months old and they fit perfectly. I love to keep him in onesies. These allow me to keep him warm and change his diaper quickly. I didn't realize when I bought them they are holiday themed with Halloweenis colors and Christmas colors.
4.0,These masks do the job just fine. They came in a plastic ziplock bag though.
4.0,She's likes it
4.0,"I wish I wouldve shopped around more and paid attention to where I couldve gotten this at a better price. $35 for 60 cards, 3 blacklight stickers, and 3 pieces of gum is a lot. But it is as described. It came in good condition, even though it was terribly slow to arrive. My son was happy and thats the most important part!"
4.0,"These boots are very comfortable and warm.  I've used them in snow and ice, and they have kept my feet dry.  I wear a size 9 shoe, so I ordered a 9.5.  It is snug, but wearable.  I've ordered another pair in a different color.  This time I'm getting a size 10."
4.0,I love the look of these. I've gotten a lot of compliments every time I wear them. The waist is high too so it covers my post baby stomach issues I hate. My only complaint is that the black &#34;netting/mesh&#34; part is somewhat scratchy which is the only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. I would order another pair so I guess it doesn't bother me that much!
4.0,"These are nice quality, fit to size, and wash up nicely - but they are too tall for my mid-calf boots. I folded the top twice and it works and still looks pretty cute. I did not realize that there is a brand tag meant to display when worn with tall boots - ugh. Otherwise good stuff."
4.0,"Smaller size than expected.  Otherwise, O.K.  Thanks."
4.0,"Robe is very nice except that the sleeves are narrow.  Wish they were wider for a looser, more comfortable fit."
4.0,"I got what I needed, i.e. glasses for driving in Arizona never ending sunny days. They fit well, I would only put pricing lower due to cheap plastic look."
4.0,"Was not able to find a way to pick the size. Bought for nephew as a gift, he loved it but it only fit his pinkie finger."
4.0,It works great and price unbeatable
4.0,Good product for little girls.
4.0,True to size. Only issue I had was thickness some of my shoes do not fit.
4.0,"This is an inexpensive rain suit, but a great deal for the cost.  I've used the pants on very cold days to keep the wind chill off."
4.0,But runs small! be aware
4.0,Cute earrings but kind smaller than expected
4.0,"Love the selection and bang for the buck. Great material, good variety, and the pieces are pretty consistent. They LOOK small however and have a very low profile flare so they may fall out easier. When I measured them using the mm measurement card that came with the set, they actually size true. My 10mm gauges in the saddle were the same size as my 10mm gauges from another company. However, the gauges I have from another company have a 12mm flare, these have an 11mm flare...and I'm returning them for a size up. They will probably fit okay, but they really need to be a size bigger for me to feel secure about their lower profile flare."
4.0,"Good quality and looks, but it always seems to be smaller than advertised. Got a medium for my daughter, like all other things - but it was too small. The seller graciously refunded me and allowed me to keep the old one. Now that they got the Large in stock I just re-ordered the L, and it fits well."
4.0,"Love the looks of the watch. therefore a 4-star rating. Their are some small problems. First in feeling some lug links, some were very smooth and some were a little sharp to touch. They were not uniform in feel. Secondly, Though there were the diamonds as stated, they were really really small and hard at times to see them and if you scoped them, they were not installed uniformly. That said, I still loved the watch.  It wasn't a super heavy watch like the other watch companys on Evine live. It was therefore very comfortable to wear."
4.0,"I have a big, bucket head. Those small, low profile hats look like a beanie on me. I got this to replace an Air Force hat that was gifted to me that was like that. This hat is great. It sits high and is nice and roomy. Besides that, it is a nice and sturdy, well-made cap that looks good. If there was one thing I could change it would be the curve of the bill is a little too curvy but I can carefully take some of that out.  If you like the higher profile hats, have a decent sized noggin and want to show your military branch pride, this is the hat for you."
4.0,"100% see through. You’ll need to layer, it at least wear a bra."
4.0,Need to sew the middle of the top closer other wise it's a good bathing suit.
4.0,La tela no me gusto y me quedo más largo de lo que quería
4.0,Cute hat.  Very well-made.
4.0,"Not sure why they needed two sets of loops, unnecessarily adds to the weight."
4.0,I love that you get two chokers along with two bracelets. The only problem is that the chokers do not stretch as much as I would've liked.
4.0,"Very light weight, beautiful love the different styles, I have so many to choose from"
4.0,Next time I will buy size seven. Plus I have the legs on one the thread started to pull right out of the pack.
4.0,"Love this flowy dress, the only thing I wish I could change is the straps, they are not adjustable. However, it falls really well of the body, the material is soft and kind of weighted which is nice when it’s really breezy out - no one will get a show!"
4.0,They were too loose for my leg there wasn't any tightness in them so no I won't be able to use the
4.0,These are cute. The blue tint film on the lenses are slightly distracting but not too… bad. Overall they are just used for a fun quirky pair of extras to flavor! Thx
4.0,"Overall this is a nice pajama set for the price. It doesn't trap sweat (although not quite as breathable as cotton or bamboo), the teal color is gorgeous, it looks more luxurious than it is. I am 5'3"" and 38-33-38 - I ordered this in medium and it fits fine on the shorts, which can comfortably stretch out to about 40 inches, so I maybe could have got a small instead because the top is on the too big side (but it's sleepwear/loungewear so it's ok to be baggy).<br /><br />The thread used in this is a little scratchy, so that's a bit annoying. And I would have liked pockets. Also the shorts are bit longer than I would have liked & a little different from the listing pictures. The fabric is relatively thick and seems sturdy, definitely no issues with see-through. The fabric itself does not stretch at all.<br /><br />The packaging wrinkles didn't come out in the wash so I guess I'll need to iron this at some point, but it doesn't develop new ones easily. Recommend to wash on cold with fabric softener & hang dry."
4.0,"These are like walking on clouds.  They mush under your feet, but not too much in my opinion.  Only issue is I purchased a men's 11 and they do not fit.  I wore them and they are about a size too big for me (womens 8)"
4.0,"The shirt is lightweight, breathable and seems to be good quality so far. I marked the fit as &#34;too small&#34; because by US standards this would be way too small. I was able to rate it 4 stars based on the quality of the shirt and after reading reviews and the description I knew that my son, a US men's small would need a medium and it fits him well with a little room to grow in but doesn't look sloppy."
4.0,"Love it! I guess I didn’t realize how sheer it was so, just plan for it to be see-thru or wear a bra but I still love it and the size is perfect!"
4.0,for my elderly mom and she loves it.
4.0,"Love the pattern! very cute swimsuit. I had the same problem as other reviewers. The lining peeps out at the bottom, but that's an easy fix. Also the cups are a little oddly placed on me. They sit well above where they should. But I have some seamstress experience so I plan on fixing that."
4.0,I like it because it doesn't rise when I walk and since I bought it for work that's a plus.
4.0,"This dress is gorgeous. I wore it to a friend's wedding. My only complaint is that the way the top portion is designed makes it impossible to wear a bra without it showing. Otherwise, its a gorgeous dress at an unbeatable price."
4.0,Beautiful and light.
4.0,"The quality of these sunglasses are a mark of their cheap price.  The frame and lenses are very flimsy and I am surprised that I did not snap them when I attempted to change the lenses out for a different pair.  Personally, they are too tight on the sides and give me a headache within 30 minutes of having them on.  I have worn these only twice and have not put them on since.<br /><br />If you're going to purchase a pair of sunglasses without having the luxury of trying them on, I suggest you go for the more well-known brand and pay the few extra dollars.<br /><br />UPDATE: I was contacted directly by Poshei about my dissatisfaction with the sunglasses. They offered to send me a new pair of my choosing for free. I chose a new model (black and orange Cycling Wrap) and just received them. They appear to be a much better fit and quality. I really appreciate the promptness and positive customer service I received and their direct contact with me about my satisfaction"
4.0,not bad for the price a nice selections of ties
4.0,Nice top but it is a little short for my liking. I live the flexible side panels. They almost hit this one out of the park. Just add an inch or two to the length and I'd be happy!
4.0,"Great, useful buckles for survival bracelets.  My husband bought them for his scout group.  It's a nice way to keep their flint & steel handy as well as a whistle.  The flint and steel is easily used.  I was able to strike a spark with it quickly, which surprised me, as I've never used flint & steel before.  The only downer is that they are a bit larger than a standard buckle, so they aren't quite as comfortable a fit for the smaller wrist.  Certainly not a reason to avoid them though.  None of the boys were bothered by it."
4.0,"Good weight and shape. Some sneakers are too clunky and heavy for little ones in sizes 4 to 5, but these were great."
4.0,Wad as expected
4.0,"Larger then I thought, but very cute"
4.0,It’s cute and stylish but It’s slightly smaller than expected and there’s a slight scratch on the small Kate Spade plate.
4.0,I love it. Dont look to close youll find the flaws. But pretty for the price. I have a super small wrist so this is nice to get a good fit.
4.0,"I ordered this suit in my normal size but it was too small to be comfortable.  I then ordered a size up and it fits well.  The only problem I have is the bust line (sewn in) is place very low, about mid torso, which is rather strange, but it doesn't affect the look of the suit, just feels rather strange.  Overall, the suit is well made and very flattering."
4.0,I bought these for a halloween costume and they worked beautifully for it!
4.0,"I bought this for neck cooling and sun protection while riding my motorcycle.  It's very breathable, light and effective.  Just don't use it for a Covid mask, it's just too breathable for that.  Seriously, a cough or sneeze will go right through, but that's not what I got for.<br />Only one gripe, and it's a minor one.  The length is about 4 inches shorter than my Buff, as shown in the photo.  Just something to keep in mind.  Otherwise it's a nice product and I wouldn't hesitate to give it a thumbs up."
4.0,"Love the look of these boys underwear.  Material almost has a ""silky"" feel. They seem to run a bit small but workable for a while.  Will buy again but a size larger."
4.0,Could have a bigger size
4.0,Attractive hat!
4.0,Fits well and washed a couple of times with no fading or shrinking. Not really dressy but nice enough to wear to work.
4.0,big but great seller
4.0,nice chain also for the price.
4.0,Fits as expected. Bought them for both of my boys for football.
4.0,This looks more expensive than it really is.
4.0,"Beautiful Hogwarts Scarf, looks bigger in pics than what it is."
4.0,Love the fit.  Not really made well and I do not put in dryer
4.0,Really big for a newborn but so cute and great quality
4.0,"We really like these shirts. Not as thick as the short sleeve one given to me by the actor who plays a Mayans MC member, but great shirt for the price.<br /><br />Just want to add that we didn't have any of the problems mentioned below. Possibly because we line dry our black clothing to reduce fading."
4.0,"Very nice suit, especially if you are trying to buy something on the sexier side. One big problem: way too small. I would suggest going up at least one, if not two sizes."
4.0,"I ended up preferring the Nillkin for my Z10, after trying this Fosmon. The color scheme should add interest and reduce boredom, but in the end I preferred simple black. The flap closure and inner pockets for credit, ID, or business cards added too much bulk for me, although others might like those features."
4.0,Fast shipping and exactly as stated.
4.0,"I love the fit. However when I began trying it on, I heard something pop and I just started to be gentle. Hopefully when I put it back on it doesn't rip or tear at the waistline. The length is great. I love long dresses"
4.0,"It's a stainless steel ring, so it will not turn your finger green. Fair warning, it's a bit more ""rough"" than it looks in the picture. The edges are a bit sharper, but not enough to cut skin. Other than that it's a good ring."
4.0,"This true wrap dress is very flattering, and the print is exactly as pictured! It looks like a beautiful kimono. I'm usually an XS or small in tops, and the small fit perfectly. The wrap design makes it more forgiving if your waist decreases or expands. I love it!<br /><br />The reason I'm giving this 4 stars, is because the material seems very delicate (something I would likely hand wash to make it last longer), and some of the seams look like they are already coming apart, so I will have to reinforce the seams by sewing it myself. If these issues were fixed, it would be perfect!"
4.0,"These sunglasses are nice and lightweight. But I specifically ordered the Teal Geode color, and there is nothing teal about the color. If anything, they are more of a slightly greenish gray."
4.0,"This is our second purchase of this watch.  My daughter, who is blind, relies heavily on her talking watch and this one is easy for her to manage. It slips easily on her wrist, with no straps to fasten, and automatically adjusts to time changes when placed on a windowsill. This newest one even came with an extra battery!  Only complaint about the first one was that it stopped talking after a couple of years, though we verified from our local watch repair shop that the battery was still working. Even so, for the money, I still think it’s a good buy...and we’ve had lots of talking watches over the years."
4.0,"Ok quality, looks really cute, but runs small"
4.0,"The quality is good, it feels like a normal swim suit. The top for me is a bit small since I am a 36DD, however, the bottoms fit perfectly, I bought a size L. The bottom reach right above my belly button."
4.0,This too is soo cute but it came way more cropped than expected
4.0,A little uncomfortable as it ran large but it’s well made.
4.0,"The burgundy was exactly as shown, the fabric was beautiful and it was very well made. The only reason I only gave it four stars was that it wasn't snug to your body like shown in the picture. So instead of an hourglass shape, it was more boxy. But with a few quick alterations it was an easy fix. Definetly worth the price and would buy again."
4.0,My son wore his at the beach. He preferred the sand on his feet
4.0,Love the dress just shorter than most
4.0,Product is almost perfect. Only down side i can see is the ends are not sewn over. This will lead to the gaitor fraying after a bunch of wear and washing.
4.0,"Ordered a small and I wear small, fit okay but the sleaves are shorter than I like."
4.0,Hubby likes his sweatshirts below the belt and some are just too short.  So far these are great and just ordered more.  Only giving 4 stars since we don't know how they'll wash but fit is very good.  He's pleased and therefore so am I.
4.0,"I ordered these after I had gotten SLS3 socks. The socks are great, unfortunately the sizing for the socks and these sleeves is not the same. The sleeves do not give as much compression as the socks but still are very good and stay up."
4.0,I like the look the most is why I bought it.
4.0,"Nice, but the sleeves are shorter than I’d like."
4.0,"I should have gotten the silver framed ones.  I looked right over the words “gold framed”, but the colors are great and so is the shape."
4.0,"I like the material,it did run large though. I will order different colors in smaller sizes"
4.0,I love the product!  The store not so much.
4.0,"Love that the pockets have zippers! I’m 5’3” and got a medium, should have purchased a small but it’s ok. I wear this above my leggings/tights when I go to dance class."
4.0,"My wife loves this cardigan. It’s lightweight, a good length, comfortable and is good for a light cardigan when it’s chilly. Price point is standard for something like this. Definitely recommend."
4.0,Dress comes small. My daughter is between a 4t and 5t. But 90% off the time 5t is big on her. I got her 4t-5t and it's really tight.
4.0,"Nice bottle, but it arrived with two dents."
4.0,"Its a really cute bag. Very lightweight. Its smaller than expected, but I am satisfied with it. It matches perfectly with some shoes I ordered."
4.0,"I ordered the khaki color, this sweater is pretty close to peach, which I really don't like but it'll be better than pink. I may try to dye this sweater, we shall see.<br /><br /> I ordered the large, based on another order of a similar item that I loved. The fabric and cut is completely different, this yarn is thicker, the weave is not light weight and is warmer. The size is a bit larger than I expected but it's correct enough. I am 5'8"" 130 lbs, and 35"" Chest. The fit is loose, and hangs nicely to the curve of my upper hip. It's a relaxed feeling and looks nice without being shown as tight fitting in the photos offered by the ad.<br /><br />The neck is a bit wonky, as there is an obvious seam there, and it's not perfect. I'd have to say that this is a factory second and not first quality. It should be offered at a discount and should be labeled as discounted. I say this for the discriminating shoppers who want clarity in the advertisements, as I do.  I intend to be an advocate for the online shopper who spends time shopping and picking out the item they order, and that item should be a good value and exactly as expected. Our time if very valuable.<br /><br />The sweater is a good style, and minus the errors, I do like it and will wear it. The color should be corrected and the ad and price could be more in line with the quality as well. I could have ordered a medium perhaps and had a more fitted, but still relaxed fit. For a snug fit, you can probably  order according to the size chart, which is accurate in my opinion. Between the fiber and the weave, it is nice and stretchy.<br /><br />I washed and dried the sweater in the machines, and it washed very nicely. No shrinkage, damage or wrinkles.<br /><br />This is a comfortable, easy wear sweater. I really like the style.<br /><br />4 stars for over all experience. Not bad even though."
4.0,Cute dress but ended up washing/drying as normal since it was a bit large.  I'm normally a 6/8 so I know that I'm often in between sizes. The back panel is very stretchy so a small would have been more than sufficient.
4.0,"The fabric of this shirt is always cool to the touch. It is a polyester but not your Mom's or Grandmother's polyester. It is very light but not sheer. The front overlap is low. I'm comfortable with a cami under it. The belt is sewn into the sides, makiing a long front or back tie. If you have a tiny waist, you might get it to go behind and around to the front. I wore this with a turquoise cami to match my skirt. The day was blisteringly hot! The shirt kept me cool by fluttering with any breeze. I was SO pleasantly surprised! Great purchase!"
4.0,They are waterproof to an extent. Snow and rain will eventually get gloves soaking wet. 2 or 3 pairs when you buy is smart to always have a dry pair
4.0,Beautiful just a tad small
4.0,A little on the small size but other then that you get what you pay for.
4.0,is acceptable
4.0,Great for curvy girls. Fabric is pretty telling but it's very stretchy and really great for the price.
4.0,"Great fit, breathable material, definitely recommended"
4.0,"The earings are beautiful and of great quality. They were no where near as blue/green as expected, but i know all the stones are different. I love them"
4.0,The zipper on this dress is a little cheap. It fit a little tight. I'm a size 8-10 normally and I get dresses in a large. I would have ordered an XL if I needed to order again
4.0,"We bought this to wear with a navy blue dress that has a gray tint to the skirt.  The gray on the shrug has a definite purple tint to it, so it won't work for us. Otherwise, it is a beautiful little shrug that would have worked well for our needs."
4.0,My husband really likes this hat.  Lightweight but works well.
4.0,"Somewhat small, but nothing a few warm washes can't fix. Order a size up."
4.0,"Great bag, very pretty and seems well made. It doesn't have any inner pockets or a top closure but is still worth the price. Very nice."
4.0,"Nice belt, well made. Sewing is even and straight. Looks great and helps spruce up some of my dresses"
4.0,The feel and drape of the fabric is lovely. The weight of the jersey it is not forgiving.  If your have no love handles etc. you will love it and good price for the quality.
4.0,"I really liked these socks for the first 2 months but of the 6 pairs I’ve bought, 3 already have holes. I wear them around the house and for regular daily activity. Nothing major or to the level of hiking.<br /><br />I wish they were more durable for the price but they do a great job of keeping my feet dry."
4.0,"These are extra comfy and beautiful. When ordering them though I was a bit confused by the size cater glories as they didn't go in sequence. Where is the size for 7-9? Once u get your size, it's well worth the purchase. Looks just as it did on the image"
4.0,"A little expensive, but my husband likes them and they keep his feet comfortable. They aren't too tight around his legs so don't cause swelling, but they do stay up."
4.0,These are warm and nice. they run a little large. If you have a very tall kid they would fit good.
4.0,Love the adjustable ear straps in the contour of the mask.
4.0,Great looking watch; but note the size - it's quite large - bought it for my son and had to return it because of its size!
4.0,"This dress is very long if you are short , 5'4"" and under, so keep that in mind. I gave it to my sis who was pregnant and it fit her perfect. But if you are not pregnant, be prepared to wear wedges or high heels because they are long maxi dress. It does fit true to size but too long for short women."
4.0,Buen regalo
4.0,This is a comfortable leggings. Good for work and more.
4.0,"Nice gloves, good price, unfortunately the smallest size is to big on my hands, too long in the fingers."
4.0,My son loves his pants
4.0,"Love these boots, minimal break in, and super comfortable from the start. My only grief with them is the soft soles didn't last. I've only got about 4 months out of them and most of the outer lugs are missing and it is starting to separate. But the comfort out ways the sole issues so I've ordered a second pair and plan on getting these resoled.<br />Would recommend 👌"
4.0,These shoes are absolutely adorable and a nice soft leather. I would have given them 5 studs but have a weird smell to them that is pretty strong. I noticed when I take them off my babies feet smell weird . Hoping it will fade with time. But other then that I love them .
4.0,"This is a nice skirt, although I didn't know from the photo that it was as sparkly as it is. Has an Indian style to it, and the waist is corduroy. This limits when and where I can wear it, but it's still lovely."
4.0,Appeared as pictured on page. Arrived promptly.<br /><br />Low rating is for the VERY lightweight backs. One of which has the hole so far off to one side that it's useless. My 4 -year-old daughter will be  very sad if they fall apart.<br /><br />We're hoping they hold up for a while. I would give them another try but would be quick to return if defective again.<br /><br />I would not recommend for small children or children who play with their earrings as they may fall apart. I will update if they do.
4.0,"I am a size 16 and ordered the XXL. Although I was able to zip it up (with a little help), I felt like a tightly wrapped sausage. This dress was very beautiful though, and the fabric used in both the bodice and the skirt was good quality, unlike some similar dresses I tried. This dirndl does come with three pieces (dress, apron, blouse) but the blouse is also extremely tight on the arms. My sister, who wears a size 8/10 US tried on the top as well and it was also too tight on her arms. If you really like the dress, I would advise looking for a separate blouse as well!"
4.0,Has a nice modern look to my workout outfits now. Definitely will get more.
4.0,"These look so good.  They have a funky, rocker, hip kind of look. If I can upload a pic I would.  I really REALLY wish that they were pierced earringd vs screwed clips.  However they hold really well.  Since all ears are different the hook on my left ear doesn't hold as well as my right.  Meh...  The cuff clips are adjustable on how tight you want it which I like. I would have given this a 5 star if it was pierced earring and cuff clips."
4.0,A bit sheer but comfortable.
4.0,"What i like about this product is that it has a nice soft feel, my daughter really like it but it came soo... late that's what I don't like, telling me it might be lost or I can get my refund so I did ask for a refund., Finally it came today Jan 2. I order It on Dec<br />23 I'm loving the product is well made has a softt touch. I think I'm just going to keep it might want to order another color."
4.0,Lovely color. Fits as expected. Poet sleeves make it “different” enough.
4.0,"My daughter LOVES this jacket!! We've been getting so much rain lately & she really needed a lightweight, rain jacket. The sleeves are a little long for what I'd personally prefer, but she doesn't seem to mind. Maybe it's a good thing, she's got a little growing room. It's not lined at all, but that's a good thing for my extremely hot natured girl. It's just perfect for a rainy day, especially a day that's not super cold."
4.0,"This coverup is very thin and see through. It doesn't cover that well, but I &quot;felt&quot; covered a bit. The sleeves are not as long as I hoped and the skirt is not as long as shown, but I wore it anyway. It is pretty."
4.0,Quality product at a fair price!
4.0,"I got these glasses while on an extended trip where I lost my sunglasses. So, first of all, these are $20 glasses. They're not $150 Oakleys or whatever. So this review is written with that in mind.<br /><br />Good: lenses are super easy to change. You get a lot of them. Hinges feel solid. It's nice to get a hard(ish) case and a soft case. Only $20. I haven't had any issues with fogging yet, though I haven't tried them in cold weather yet, either.<br /><br />Not as good: styling leaves a little to be desired. I got black to be the least flashy, but the silver parts on the temples are still pretty bright. Sorta wish I just got blue and went super flashy.  Could do without the logo on the lenses. From a usage perspective, the mirrored and black are sorta redundant. The black is polarized. The others aren't."
4.0,"Very nice and warm. Looks great. Seems to snag easily, but that could be just me."
4.0,"The foot grip on yoga mat, good traction."
4.0,"Good size crossbody bag. It looks sleek and modern while still feeling rustic. The color is great throughout and the quality of the stitching is pretty good. My only negative, is that the zipper is a bit funky and I am not sure how well it will hold. At the time of the review the pricing was unavailable, thus I didn’t assess the fairness of the pricing.<br />If my review helped you in any way, please let me know by clicking the ""helpful"" button below.  Any questions you may have, feel free to ask… Thank you!"
4.0,Si me gusto las cosas que compre
4.0,Buckle strap could be longer for larger heads.
4.0,"Got it for a concert outfit and I think it will fit well.<br />Just like the picture, just needs a quick ironing.<br />Just wish they had a larger size."
4.0,It looks good but because of the filter its a little bit hard to breath. Also they should do something with the smell of the face mask. Maybe spray it with a lemon scent.
4.0,"My feet do NOT hurt,  that's the main thing. I ordered Men's sizing by accident but hey I got plenty room for winter socks."
4.0,"[[ASIN:B00OW0NQGE Mehr® Classic Leather Key Chain | Elegant, Timeless, Multi-ring Capable Keychain (Black)]]<br /><br />I purchased this for my husband. He carries a lot of keys and store reward cards on his keychain. He has had it FOREVER! Sometimes, I think the poor, old keychain is going to go to keychain heaven. I've been delaying getting him another one because I haven't found one that I think he would like. He will not use one that is not made of leather and durable. He doesn't like it to be fancy. He is a very modest man that is interested in functionality and performance rather that looks. With this one, he gets both! When I received this in the mail, I was extremely impressed. It came in a nice box ready for gift giving. The leather was very high quality. I know this because hubby works at a tannery. It is very well constructed and does not have any material defects. The stitching is above par! I sew a lot and I am always checking the stitching on everything I consider buying or have bought. This is essential when it comes to keychains. One bad stitch and it can fall apart on you.  It comes with 2 extra rings so that it can accommodate more keys, if you need them. I just used them to separate his keys from his rewards cards. There is nothing negative I can say about this keychain or think of how it can be improved upon. I was very please with it!<br /><br />I received this keychain at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review."
4.0,The only problem that I had was that I didn't order the correct size for my body frame. I connected the seller and they issued full refund. The shirt is well made with good quality fabric. I would use this brand again.
4.0,"Love this tank for working out, arm holes are really large and neck is a bit high but it is comfortable and breathable."
4.0,"If you are looking for a basic, nice fitting hoodie, this would probably work for you. It fit me as expected and it holds its shape."
4.0,Very cute shirt! Shows off the booty and not the tummy. Just have to return for a size small. I am usually a medium.
4.0,Such a cute nighty! The little flower is adorable. Only thing is it runs a little snug. You might want to go up a size. Other than that it is comfortable and cute as heck! Hope you enjoy yours!
4.0,I needed sunglasses for over my glasses. These were a great value and made nicely.b
4.0,"La tela es más oscura de lo que parece, yo elegí celeste..."
4.0,I own so many of this style and am always looking for a new pattern.  This is gorgeous.  It rides a little higher in the front than I like but nothing I would send it back for.
4.0,"I almost love this bag. I wish it was a little darker beige-- it shows dirt, but most can be wiped off with all-purpose cleaner. The vinyl is getting a little discolored, however, from so much use. I take this bag everywhere. The strap was realllllllly long so I punched in some extra holes and ended up cutting about a foot off of the strap. (it still can be worn cross body, but I normally don't)  It's a small bag and it looks like a small bag, but it's got lots of room. I like that I don't have to open the entire purse to get something out-- there are 3 zippered compartments. I can put almost everything I put in my larger shoulder bag in this bag. I did have to buy a smaller wallet, however. There's plenty of room for keys, cell phone, wallet, sunglasses, etc. Since it comes in other colors I will be ordering another darker one for fall/winter.  The tassel is kind of cute, too, but if you don't like it, you can easily unclip it from the bag."
4.0,It is cute but cheap looking.
4.0,I absolutely LOVE this! I am 5’4 150 and usually wear a small. I will say the sizing is very small. I wish it was a little bigger but overall it’s adorable
4.0,"This is a nice looking wallet that looks well constructed.  I gave it 4 stars so far since I've only had it for a couple of days...if it holds up as well as my last magnetic money clip wallet, it will earn 6 or 7 stars, but too early to tell"
4.0,I really like the shoe; however I do suggest if you have flat feet you may want to go up a size.  The shoes has a slight narrow fit.
4.0,Love it tricky to put on but gorgeous nonetheless.
4.0,"Good quality with tastefully packed. There are two color, black and red. These two colors are both beautiful, but I think the red one  will be good for older women. My mom loves the red one a lot. The size for the bag is also perfect, not too big but not small. The price is also reasonable for such a good quality bag. Perfect gift for moms."
4.0,"Length is perfect for my shallow belly piercing. Stones are very pretty, but the larger stone rattles around in the setting, although it doesn’t seem like it will fall out."
4.0,"My wife is slender and these fit perfectly. They are soft, warm, and look great with dresses.  Only issue is the black rides much lower than the red; don't know why the difference."
4.0,Very cute. I them. Took a while to get here though.
4.0,"I've been wearing this hoop in my daith for six months now and the metal still keeps reacting with my ear. None of my other healed piercings have this problem, so it must be the material this hoop is made of."
4.0,[[VIDEOID:adc8ee7a93e879f4a3e06ccf6752a2f8]] Fits as expected
4.0,My daughter is 41 pounds and little too small for him
4.0,"Cute purse, can't put much in if you use a wallet but I like it.  My friend liked it too and wants one."
4.0,"I really like this, it's great"
4.0,The loops definitely helps hold end of the belt from awkwardly sticking out. The belt loops on pant aren't place close enough. These help with the gaps to hold the belt in place.
4.0,Love it! But it does fog up after a while. My mom and I receive many compliments when we’re out in public. I get to where my lipstick and be cute during COVID.
4.0,"Bought for my daughter for her birthday.. They run a little larger than expected if you go by US sizes, however, everything else is as described. Well packaged, and arrived ahead of schedule. My daughter LOVES them!"
4.0,"Update: my SO is utterly crushed. She didn't even make it out the door before noticing the fabric had frayed. (We don't know how or when.) She didn't even get one use out of this magical sweater 😢<br /><br />The biggest benefit to extended winter is a longer season of sweater weather.  This one is so soft and comfortable, it almost feels handmade! And there is no annoying tag to prove otherwise.  I did not remove it for the pictures -- it came that way straight from the package. (Update: there's a small tag on the inside seam that's easy to miss.)<br /><br />Brown looked the most attractive from the pictures and it lives up every bit to expectations.  At $30 current pricing, it's an absolute steal.  And sizing is spot on.  It's not humongous, but just right. Even for non-supermodels ;)<br /><br />Although spring is right around the corner, thank goodness there's still time to enjoy the snuggly warmth this provides!"
4.0,"The quality of these pants is very nice; however, the fit is odd.  The waist is cinched a bit which makes the size 6 waist ok for my grandson that generally wears a size 5, yet the length is at least 3 inches too long.  I'm keeping the pants because such nice material and I'll loosely hem and hopefully he'll wear them again."
4.0,I wear a 36 x32 jean and a 40 DD bra.  I ordered the largest size and thought it was a bit snug on the top. It is very comfortable and seems to be made well.  The dress does not reach your shoes but to adjust it you can just double up part of the midsection that is crunchy material.  I  am chunky and no hiding it with this one.  Not the dress's fault.
4.0,have not worn yet; colors are great
4.0,Love this piece. Everyone comments on how eye catching it is !!!!
4.0,Super cute necklace my 11 year old loved it.
4.0,"Love the style, fabric and weight of the jacket. I normally wear a med/lg, so I ordered the large thinking it would be large enough to layer, however, the jacket is tight through the shoulders making it difficult to move freely."
4.0,Helps with headaches. I wish it didn’t reflect the screen in the glasses.  I’m working on lighting to see if you if that helps.<br />Otherwise that are very good purchase and price!
4.0,"Got my necklace on time, it was exactly as it is in the picture, beautiful, very dressy, only thing is it is a bit on the heavy side. Love it!!"
4.0,"Would be a nice jumper for someone, just not me. I'm 6'0, so I assume it's just not long enough in the torso for my height. I bought a large."
4.0,I got these for my nose. I prefer pressure balls than captives and horse shoe rings. The opening for this ring is extremely small. I had to eventually stretch out the ring just to put it in. I have an average size nose. Once I got the ring in it’s very comfortable and made well. Just prepare to stretch the ring if your getting these for your nose
4.0,received them yesterday everything looks great but 1 of the tongue rings is missing it's tip.
4.0,amazing it fits perfect! will forsake buy another one
4.0,"I thought they were okay, suction power etc  but then a guest tried them on and experienced the double vision some others had too. Pretty clear and the wide vision is better than single eye goggles maybe not for racing but hanging out and finding pool toys"
4.0,"I’m 5.7 and 160 but I bought M size. They’re not too big or too small, so I guess they’re just the right size.<br />Also I really like this material :) it’s very comfortable. However tears easily!! That’s why I bought 2 of the same things."
4.0,excelente calidad contento con la compra
4.0,Just a little bit too big for my son’s face but I know that it will fit him soon. Definitely super cool looking sunglasses. I especially like the soft case - making my 3 year old feel like an adult with his own case. :)
4.0,I only wish the waistband wasn’t elastic or had more flat elastic lay. All in all I like the pants though!
4.0,Some were super cute and some were super cheesy. Bought for vacation and the ones i wore only lasted for a week. I was bummed cause they were super cute.
4.0,Really cute but just way too revealing on me. I would imagine this romper would be best for someone with smaller legs and a smaller booty.
4.0,"I love this shirt and wear it a lot. It covers my tummy fat and makes me feel comfortable. I can wear it with shorts or leggings and my bum feels pretty covered. Two downfalls- it pills up a lot after a while, and the color was not quite like the picture. The zigzag stripes look gray in the photo, but are actually black. The contrast is a little harsh compared to what I expected from the photo advertised."
4.0,Slightly bigger than expected but still beautiful
4.0,Love these. Fits great!
4.0,I realy like the dress  Wish I sized down.
4.0,I've only worn these a few times so they probably still feel a little tight because they're new. They feel a little bit short but the width is fine  The materials are high quality and the distressed look means they are suitable for a lot of occasions.  They look well made and the heel height is very comfortable.  I walk at lunch time so I'm always looking for shoes and boots that can be worn to walk for blocks and blocks.
4.0,"It's a very nice shirt. Runs a bit bigger than I expected. My bigger issue is the smell. I've worn this shirt atleast 5 times and with all the washes, it still has a dye smell to it. No matter what detergent or fabric softner the smell is always present."
4.0,I ordered the blouse to accompany the pants I purchased at a discount store. (I had to have the complete outfit) The blouse fits snuggly at the point where the white cuff attaches to the sleeve. And across the shoulders. I believe this to be a manufacturing flaw. Because the pants fit snuggly as well even tho the size is much larger than I wear. The shipment was prompt and the packaging was flawless. Crisp and beautiful. I look forward to wearing my new ensamblè
4.0,Perfect for my 6yo! Easy for him to get on and off by himself. This is his second year wrestling and he says they are comfortable and easy to move in. My only complaint would be the Velcro snagging on the tongue on the shoe. My son has only worn these shoes a handful of times now and they are already getting pretty fuzzy on top. I’m not sure how they will look by the end on the season. So far I am not having this problem with the Aesic Velcro Matflex shoes I bought at the same time  for my 7yo.
4.0,Love this hat.  The only issue is that the beads are only stitched on in one place so whenever the hat is turned upside down the beads fall off the rim and have to be untangled and put back on.
4.0,Good quality and very cute. They run a little small. They don't go all the way up to my almost 5 year old's knees. They are the right height on my almost 3 year old (but his legs are very chubby so they are a bit tight on him).
4.0,Nice jacket.  I normally wear size 12 and bought an XL and if fits a little big. Material is not cotton.  It's not a long jack it's short bug not too short.
4.0,"I needed a basic white T and this was a good purchase.  Not too low cut, nice enough fabric, not see through and washes well.  Nuf said."
4.0,Es muy bonito y cómodo
4.0,"Would have loved to have kept these because they were so spongy, but they would not stay on my feet because they were loose."
4.0,Fit great nice material
4.0,"Slightly too big for a 3 year old face, without a means to adjust. Cute designs, thicker fabric, no nose piece."
4.0,little snug but comfy
4.0,These are really soft and lightweight. Perfect for summer lounging.
4.0,Fit me perfectly! Though I was a little worried it was going to be too big from the measurements. Had some problems with the zipper but otherwise is warm but light.
4.0,"I love this shirt and the velvet material for parts of Snow White. I normally wear an XL but this ran a little big. I've tried to shrink it but to no avail, which I guess is a good thing."
4.0,Got so many complements on this jacket. Wear skinny jeans with a tank underneath and looks great and really lite and breezy.
4.0,Very light n comfortable. Good for the price.
4.0,a couple came with holes at the seems. otherwise great for summer
4.0,It’s good just A little too big on my face
4.0,COULD BE $10 LESS
4.0,I ordered the medium after MUCH comment reading...I really couldn't decide on the size.  I'm 5'4&#34; and about 130 lbs. I found the medium was just too big.  I ended up returning it and ordering a small which fit much nicer.  The pic shows the small - sorry not the best pic but you can get an idea.
4.0,This was a great fit. tight around the arms and chest and loose around the stomach.  only thing you should not is that there is no give in the material. ZERO stretch so buying the right size is going to be key
4.0,The slit is a little higher than expected but overall it's a comfortable dress. The only thing is the belt it comes with will fall quickly.
4.0,"For what it was, it was fine.  Not that this is more costume quality.  I wore it to a party and then put it in the good will.  The veil is pretty stiff and didn't lie down neatly like a higher quality netting would have, but for what I paid for it, it was acceptable."
4.0,I love this purse! I get lots of compliments
4.0,The arm holes are way too tight.
4.0,"Perfectly stylish. I get compliments everytime I wear them. They do slide out a little bit, and if you have multiple piercings it can be a bit crowded on your ear."
4.0,Quick and easy thanks
4.0,"Found this outfit to be totally cute. It’s cut a little short in the crouch. Had to be mindful of the camel toe. 🐫I’m 5’3, 150lb. I ordered a large. You will be a total total knock out on this getup."
4.0,"Nice, but needed a little more material."
4.0,This is a dainty & lovely necklace for my teenage granddaughter. The topaz (December) stone complements her blue eyes nicely!
4.0,Love this tee-shirt. Got lots of compliments!
4.0,Use of arms is cumbersome.  Suggest slot for arms be longer to allow arm usage without the bunched feeling of the cape.
4.0,"Order a size up! It's true material. True Nike, but order a size up!!"
4.0,Not as long as I wanted but nicely made.
4.0,It is a nice top to wear with jeans or dressier!  Material as shipped shows no wrinkles.
4.0,I like this because it is durable and it would be great for Halloween
4.0,Like the bra. Irdered 4xl still too small? Gave away
4.0,Appear ok
4.0,"Shirt is cute and soft! Lace detail overhangs at the neck, but it's not scratchy. I like the green -- it's a nice autumn-y jewel tone. The lace detail is sewn on a little sloppily (not tacked all the way down -- see my photos), but I think from far away it looks fine.<br /><br />The tag says not to tumble dry, but of course I did because no one has time for that. It came out perfectly fine, didn't shrink or anything.<br /><br />I sized up on this and got a 3X just to be sure because I don't like things too tight, but I think I could have gone with a 2X. I'm 5' 5"", 40i bust, usually wear a 16/18. I love the way this hangs and there's plenty of room in the chest and arms for me."
4.0,Muy bonito.<br />El único inconveniente es que no tiene total sujeción a la cabeza ( cabello ) yo me lo traté de adaptar con clips negros para que no se moviera mucho.
4.0,A little thinner than expected but super soft.
4.0,Super cute top! Only reason I did 4 stars was because the top is extremely see through and you’ll need a tank top under it. Otherwise fits well!
4.0,"Fits great, elastic waist!"
4.0,Love them I like that I can layer them and it comes with a lot of different styles for a good price. The clasps are a little difficult but that's not a huge issue.
4.0,"The gown is cute. It’s a lot shorter on me than the model, I’m 5’7 and mostly legs. It rests right in the center of my butt. It’s cute for the bedroom but I can’t run around the house in it ."
4.0,"As with every other piece of clothing I have that is made by Columbia, this hat is durable, well made, and fits great.  I wear it all the time, and it gets beaten up pretty well, and still holds its shape."
4.0,Looks awesome! Shines and sparkles and feels very well made! Looking forward to buying from them in the future.
4.0,Nice strap - looks great on my Hamilton watch with Hirsch Sport clasp.
4.0,"My bad. I didn't know how small 4mm was. Good for baby ears, but would go through my big holes. Will buy the 10mm.  I think those will be large enough."
4.0,I have 3 pairs from this brand and the pair with the dots are definitely tighter and leave dot indentations than the solid pair or the striped pair.
4.0,Good product for the money. Shinier then I expected but I like them anyway
4.0,Looks exactly like the pic and very good quality for the price! I'll buy from this store again.
4.0,"These rings are so much fun! I absolutely adore the large one that looks like the dragon from Mulan, but they are all great. You get 9 different rings to either wear separately or together in whatever combination you choose depending on your mood. The rings themselves are a little bit large for me, so I can really only wear them on my thumbs or maybe on my pointer fingers. The listing states that they are adjustable, but I find it hard to adjust them (although I am quite small and not very strong). They are really nice quality and do not irritate my fingers or turn them green."
4.0,"I got a large based on the chart, but could have definitely gotten away with a medium. These are super cute and so comfy! Not itchy or scratchy at all, and no underwire! Sometimes I even forget  I'm wearing them! Wash well, soft, and I feel good wearing them! Love them!!"
4.0,"Nice material, size does run a bit shorter compared to other belts same size. You might want to consider buying one size up."
4.0,"Not as nice as more expensive ones of course, but these worked perfectly for our group of high school guys.  The clips stayed on and they all looked really good."
4.0,Really soft and cute. Runs a bit small.
4.0,"The posters came in perfect condition! The picture felt like newly printed photos, I would recommend NOT touching the printed part, you could get fingerprints/dirt on them. They are just as expected! Nice for a small/medium sized area on the wall. I gave it four stars because on the back of some of the posters there are stains. The stains don't effect the print but I'm pretty sure I didn't order stains with my posters.<br />Over all, 9/10 would recommend!"
4.0,"Love the set but I am normally a XS/S and I ordered a small- it was VERY snug, size up!"
4.0,"The shirt is gorgeous and as pictured. The arms are a bit tight as a previous reviewer mentioned, but otherwise a good fit."
4.0,"I have to admit I was apprehensive about how quality this bowtie would be. But you know, it looks good! I don't know how long it will last but it held up enough for a party and will probably get a few more uses out of it -- maybe even a few dozen. Worth the purchase."
4.0,Product is just like the picture
4.0,Color was a little weird
4.0,comes a bit higher above the knee than I expected but otherwise fit really well.  cute dress.
4.0,They did fit im glad i went with my instincts and ordered a larger size than i normally would have for other leggings BUT they pool at the ankle area and they go white when stretched so be weary of what you wear under them. They are very comfy and super cute
4.0,"Very very warm, but it has some problem after using it for 2 months"
4.0,"the fabric on the shirt and pants is nice and stretchy.  Full elastic waistband on the pants. Mask is a little awkward and made of thick felt.  Hat is super weird shape (kinda like a french beret with tight elastic)...didnt use it and used a beanie instead.  The loot bag is not huge, so may need something different for large amount of trick or treating."
4.0,A little small around the hip area but I love the print.  Very pretty top for spring!
4.0,"This dress works for a variety of body sizes. It gives a nice flattering look that hugs your curves just right, but doesn't leave you feeling restricted. There is plenty of stretch in this dress where you can move comfortably sitting or standing, and wont ride up on you when you reach above your head. I am 5&#34;7 303 lbs and wear a 42 DDD. My only complaint about this dress is the top. it says you can wear it button up or down, but that's not entirely true. The built in camisole is split in the front so when you wear it un button all your breast and bra is exposed so I had to but a lace cami bra to wear under it. Be prepared to have to wear this dress unbutton if you have large breast...plenty of stretch also means tacky looking button gaps! I bought a petticoat to wear under this dress to give it a more full bell shape look, but I think it looks great without one too. I would totally buy this dress again and recommend it. It really does suit all shape and sizes. Decent price too, its made very well."
4.0,This was a little bigger than I expected but it is super soft and cute to see running around the house.
4.0,Shape is very nice fit is amazing on my small size face but it’s bit dark than I expected wish if it was lighter for vision
4.0,My husband just loves this when I  wear it. Very nice.
4.0,"This is a good wallet. I was slightly disappointed by how few cards I can fit in this wallet. I like a minimalist wallet, but I still have quite a few cards I need to carry around. This fits four comfortably and you can stuff more in, but it's a tight fit. I really like my Basics wallet, but this is a cheaper option. It's a little more bulky than other minimalist wallets I would say. But it's a quality wallet nonetheless."
4.0,"Purchased this for my son as he loves Godzilla. Decent shirt, great graphics, good fit, and he chose it for his first day of school outfit, so I’d give that a win. Not a huge fan of the fabric as it’s then and feels cheap, but it’s easy enough to care for and there was no color bleeding."
4.0,"This is a super cute pair of pjs! Of course it fit on the large side in my opinion but in my experience all of the pjs that are made like this run on the large side, especially compared to the cotton fitted pjs. This pair was also a little thinner then I expected but overall it's cute and very warm. I love the little hood on it too!!"
4.0,"This product is perfect in its intended purpose and very easy to use but I removed a star for its poor button/charger design.  The button/charger comes up and sticks out of a cut in the material on the inner ankle of both shoes.  first, the button can get mashed a bunch of times while just walking and the wire can slide back into the material.  I sewed the material around the wire to prevent it from sliding back in.  I placed a small over over the button to prevent it from being mashed constantly and changing from colors you choose.  Otherwise the product is perfect and after walking around theme parks, playgrounds and kids parties with them...they are not broken or messed up in any way yet.  So this is a pretty good product worth a try.  The big plus here is I can find my kid in the middle of the night without having to struggle."
4.0,Beautiful look not best quality
4.0,It is a beautiful sweater and so soft! Great quality. I think sizes run a little bigger than I thought so for me in the future I would get a size smaller.
4.0,"Cute earrings- not to big, not too small. They aren't the most expensive looking things but you get what you pay for. They are definitely fun!"
4.0,fun prop for parties and get togethers
4.0,"For a very cheap in price watch it certainly looks far more expensive and with a Japanese quartz movement it keeps good time.  I did not buy it for actual chronograph use, however, it does work but the hands are small and it would not be my first choice if that was my intended function.  One con is that the strap is small.  I have small to average wrist size and the strap just fits.  If you have a large wrist you will need a larger strap.<br />I was at a dinner function and I asked people around the table to guess at the price....most thought $500 when in fact it was $19.99.  Will it last?  Will have to wait and see, so far so good after 1 month."
4.0,"Fits as expected. I ordered the medium, I'm 5'6, 140 pounds and it wasn't too short (like some of the other reviews stated) Would order again in other colors."
4.0,"These underwear feel great, good quality and material"
4.0,My husband gave me this watch for Christmas and I love it. It’s beautiful and still working great. Very easy to adjust the mesh band after googling how to. This watch is a bargain; looks expensive at a low price.
4.0,Tunic dress wear it with leggings because it’s very see through all over the bottom ends . Cheap fabric will cause issues. I was hoping this was thick fabric and that it would last longer but guess not.
4.0,Cute sunglasses. Tan lenses
4.0,Perfect earring's for any little girl with sensitive ears. Multiple colors and choices ! Would highly recommend!
4.0,"Good quality with very reasonable price, same as picture on web. Just pay attention for the size, smaller than usual size, I'm 1.65m (5.4f). 52kg (114lb), normally my size is 4 or even 2 sometimes but I ordered size 6 thanks to previous reviews and it fits me perfectly. Just 1 downside is the zipper is hard to pull around the thick layers fabric"
4.0,Nice and fresh my kid love it.
4.0,Nice shirt! As described! Love the color and oversized fit!
4.0,I got these to get out of flip flops after the toe thing was bugging my foot. I usually wear a 6.5 or7. The 6.5 was too small and at first I thought the 7 was too big but they aren't. They are very comfy. Very bouncy which took some getting used to but now I love them. After all day on my feet these are wonderful to come home to. I wish they would make a terry cloth version for a more slipper like feel.
4.0,"I am thus far very happy with the design of this belt. Its design makes it incredibly easy to adjust, put on, and take off. Only reason it's not quite 5-stars is the buckle face. Understanding that the material itself is very strong, my issue is that the buckle looks cheap because of the flat face and the random fibrous look. It looks like it was made out of tool handles. From a distance (and from a practical perspective) this is no problem at all. Certainly nobody is studying my belt long enough to notice, but it'd be nice to have a more smooth look, or even a subtle pattern stamped on the face. I'd definitely consider the upgrade worth paying for, too, so it's not a complaint regarding cost: I know solid products aren't cheap, and I'd pay for a little extra beauty.<br /><br />Overall, great product, I'm very happy. Well done, all!"
4.0,"Absolutely gorgeous color! The sweater is beautiful, but it does run small."
4.0,"It's beautiful and looks like the picture. I'm usually a small, but this is a tad large for me. I will keep it though, and may make some alterations or do some creative pinning. It really is a gorgeous and unique dress"
4.0,"Very delicate looking, goes with everything. Great purchase!"
4.0,Comfortable. Medium support.
4.0,Alittle longer than I expected but for good and are thinker than most tight like items
4.0,great frames for the price
4.0,I have not used them as yet but they look really nice.
4.0,"The sizing is a little strange, but this product is great. I was looking for something that was comfortable without seams that would show under clothing. Good product for the price."
4.0,I really like this purse it the perfect size for me. I bought one in blue. I like the Bella purses. Thank you for a great product.
4.0,"This is a great looking dress and very comfortable.  I ordered the large and the extra large and honestly, I can't tell much difference.  The xl is only a tiny bit roomier (at least for me).  Still, if you are deciding between sizes I would say the higher one is a better bet.  I'm happy with how the dress looks and got many compliments on it.  The buttons seem a little loose (and one actually fell off after one wear) so I would recommend reinforcing them.  Despite that, I love this dress and will get ( I hope!) a lot of wear out of it at work."
4.0,Nice leggings and color ....easy to wear...
4.0,Bought these as a gift for a nurse. She says she loves them! They help with long shifts.
4.0,"Looks nice, doesn't seem very rigid for carrying a firearm."
4.0,My daughter won't take it off! It cleans we and was a great buy!
4.0,I like it and would recommend to others.
4.0,"I love these lace socks, they're much sturdier than I expected, but they're not no-show in today's ballet & more open style slip-ons...you'll see them (which is a plus in my mind) around the edge of all but the most traditional of penny loafer style shoes"
4.0,I had thought that there would have been a variance in sizes. Not much but enough to use on different fingers better.
4.0,"These are nice!!:) but some studs were off,"
4.0,"Okay ladies! This dress was such a good find, in my opinion. I ordered the XL because I am 5'11, weigh 200 lbs, and have a 38DD chest size.  Here's what I found with this dress:<br /><br />it's fits really nicely! I love the feel of the velvet and the color is gorgeous. the little cutout in the front tends to move a little on larger chested women, so be mindful of that! good length, longer in the back than the front to cover up that booty.<br /><br />my only complaint is that the transition from the high-to-low cut is a little weird. I'm including photos so you can see what I mean!<br /><br />If you're looking for a flowy dress, order a size up. Your regular size or a size down will get you a tight fit. I overall totally recommend this dress!"
4.0,"&quot;WOW&quot;<br /><br />I Truly LOVE These Yoga Pants, They Are SUPER Soft &amp; Comfortable.<br />I Just LOVE That Softness Against My Skin.<br />I Can Stand, Sit, Bent Anyway In These Pants With Ease!<br />I Got a Size: Large And it Fits a bit Big in Certain Areas, But Its Cool!<br /><br />They Came To Me Fast Without Any Funny Odors.<br />I LOVE The Color, And Style Of These Pants.<br /><br />I Would LOVE To Get Many Colors But Just In a Size Medium This Time.<br /><br />SOLID: 87% Nylon 13% Spandex, HEATHER: 47% Nylon 46% Polyester 7% Spandex, SPACE DYE: 90% Polyester 10% Spandex<br />Perfect for yoga, exercise, fitness, any type of workout, or everyday use.<br />The Fabric is designed to contour perfectly to your body, giving you a streamlined look.<br /><br />I Am Very Pleased!<br /><br />Thanks! :-)"
4.0,Nice but not the right fit.
4.0,Completes my Black & White and X's & O's sets. Had them for a while and wear them often.
4.0,I bought a large. I'm 5'1. Weight 140. I could have bought a med. But I didn't want it tight. I wanted the jacket to be less cropped also. If your curvy go up a size. If your not. Your size should work.
4.0,I got the grey and black combo pack.  The black ones are my FAVORITE pants I own to wear.  They stay up and fit great! They grey however have a tough time staying in place.  Love the color though!
4.0,Nice but not quite the material I thought it was going to be
4.0,"Looks exactly like the photos in the listing. Fits well and the magnetic closure seems very very strong. I won't fear this falling off by any means. It firs have a strong chemical smell that reminded me of the nail salon, then I realized I'm pretty sure the smell is the adhesive on the bracelet holding the stones in place. The stones are all pretty and the bracelet is particularly pretty when the light hits it. Upon closer inspection I realized that it actually kind of looks like a strip of sticky tape that was dipped in a vat of stones however because so many of the crystals are adhered upside down with the backing sticking up and a lot of them were hanging off the edges of the bracelet it appears that they were not at adhered to the bracelet with a great deal of care. So it may be a pretty bracelet even with those on small flaws but now I'm wondering really how long it will last knowing that the stones aren't carefully individually-placed but more or less just a grouping of them pressed in all at once haphazardly. Ilk update on the longevity of the piece as I wear it more.<br /><br />I received a discount on the purchase of this bracelet in exchange for my honest unbiased review. My reviews are all genuine and based solely on my personal experience with each product and I leave a review for. I review in the hopes of helping other consumers make well-informed purchase decisions and I rely heavily on reviews and making decisions on what to purchase for myself and my family."
4.0,Material is cotton knit and heavy for summer
4.0,Loved the packaging and the item itself the color tint is not too dark can be worn when sunsets
4.0,"These were for my wife, and just what she wanted. The bows are slightly short, but usable. The only thing that bothers me is the amount of time to get them was a tad longer than I thought it would be."
4.0,The color is not my favorite
4.0,So cute but the bottoms are really big
4.0,"My daughter loves her coat! Great price, very stylish! We have had this coat for a while, some of the stitches are coming loose in the pocket.  But otherwise a great coat."
4.0,Nice quality but they run tight and small.  Not sure if they will shrink after washing.
4.0,Love this but the clip broke and I’ve only had it a month!
4.0,fits well and soft
4.0,I'm 5'9&#34; 240lbs I got a 2xl I wish I got a xl. The material is very thin.since I was going to cancun it didn't matter.
4.0,"Heavy duty. Kinda heavy, but that's what u get when u get heavy duty! No smell like some have said. Straps kinda cheap, but serves it's purpose, and keeps cost low. I would rather have the quality in the apron itself, personally. Good quality apron. I recommend using the cross strap method for the straps and not around the neck like traditional aprons. Seems faded black/grey in places, but not bad considering it's not ment to be a fashion statement, it's ment to keep yucky crap off of ur fashion statement, lol. Long enough to keep stuff out of ur boots, too. All in all happy with purchase, and have others asking me to order them one :)"
4.0,It is a gift so hopfully they like it
4.0,"I like them a lot but they are a little thin. The color is great and they’re not see-through, but the material is pretty thin. I’ll wear them once in a while but I’m not working out in them."
4.0,These shirts are very nice looking and good value considering the 3-pack and pricing. The quality isn’t best as one of the tank tops we’re ripped taking it out of the package.
4.0,"Had some minor imperfections, but great pin for a Friends fan"
4.0,"Well, they are comfortable, and they work......I still do not like wearing these things, but I do not have a choice in the matter.  At least these make it more bearable."
4.0,"Absoutley love it so soft and warm,  in fact I'm wearing it today.  Yes I got it for myself (older female) 5'6' 150 a little large in the breast and don't like things to tight.  So,  usually get Lg to XLg for the extra room.  I bought a XLg and even though this is men's sizing I would call it a womans Lg.  or  a men's medium,  It definitely runs very small.  I'm kinda wishing I had bought a XXLg,  if it shrinks it will be to tight.  Other than the sizing issue Love it,  great quality."
4.0,"This is a beautiful key chain/fob and feels really nice in your hand. It's got a great subtle look and would have received five stars had it been just a little shorter. All in all, I'm not too disappointed."
4.0,"Comfy set of pajamas, just be careful with washing it, it loses it’s softness but this is my second set I’ve ordered from here so I loved it!"
4.0,"Afforable $$$.<br />1 of 3 purchased.<br />Although the shirt is a size small it has stretchability. Normally, I wear a size 12...no problems.  The only alteration I made to the skirt(s) was a split on the side.  This skirt and the two others are now a part of my cruising on the high seas attire.<br />CON:  Thin...see through fabric."
4.0,"Soft ,attractive and durable.<br />Not quite shaped for left and right."
4.0,"4 stars due to low price.  Seems very decent for the money.  However note the back is not mesh, only the sides are mesh."
4.0,Very nice ...its more.of a fall out fit if you want it for winter you will need thermals under it....thin material
4.0,"I'm 5'4, 27wks pregnant and 150lbs and got this dress in a large and is very comfy on me. The dress does fit just a little bit loose on my chest but i figured my breasts will get bigger later on and then the dress will fit perfectly! As far as the length, I wear flats with it and the dress does not touch the ground! The material overall is very soft and I'm very comfortable in the dress."
4.0,Easy to use. Highly recommend
4.0,"Belt seems well made compared to other belts I have seem and used. Can pass as the “real” branded belt!! Reason for 4 stars so far, still need to wear it repeatedly to see if it hold up after time"
4.0,"So definitely not as long and flowy as appears on the model but still cute and comfy. Definitely longer in the front, too short to cover your butt if you're looking to wear with leggings and a shorter top. Still a cute product. I'm 5'10&#34; 260 lbs, ordered 2X and it fits nicely, comfortable and not tight in the arms though the sleeves come just to my wrist."
4.0,"Good quality, does not look cheap or anything. Satisfied with the product !"
4.0,Very comfortable.  I love Hue pj's.
4.0,Good for the price. But not warm enough for cold weather. Fine for the Fall
4.0,I love this ring! I've been wearing it for two years and think it's the perfect size. I never take it off so it gets a lot of wear. It now looks more silver than rose gold as it is rubbing off but I guess that is expected.
4.0,"As a restaurant manager, I needed to make sure the aprons I was providing my staff were quality, these are. I have had a few that the seams have ripped pretty quickly and produced holes but for the most part, they work very well. The 3 pocket feature is great and they are quite easy to clean."
4.0,I normally wear a size medium. I'm 5'4 150 lbs and they fit a little snug and give you camel toe.
4.0,great style and nice quality
4.0,They’ll do the job
4.0,Fast shipping! Great fit!
4.0,"i liked it, just needed a smaller size. Does support the hips while exercising. Would love it tighter."
4.0,"I like the look of this over a long-sleeve shirt, but I probably wouldn't wear it without something over or under it. The material isn't terribly breathable, and the fit under the arms didn't sit quite right. The pattern is great and I didn't mind the print quality, but the edges are somewhat unfinished, so you have to like that look."
4.0,Has a very nice and snug fit. This does run a little small and can be see through if its too tight so beware of that but they are nice
4.0,What I really liked about this dress is wash and wear and comfortable
4.0,"Good value, waiting to see if it holds up!"
4.0,The white watchband was broken and I tried to reach out to the seller but couldn't find their contact information😔
4.0,"Purse is what I expected as far as looks and size, its also very roomy inside. Color was also a perfect match to photo. It feels sturdy enough that it should last a long while. My only complaint is that it had an unpleasant odor to it and I had to air it out for a day. Even with that I would buy again."
4.0,"A little disappointed. The material is nice, pockets are huge, but the shape of these is just odd. The top of the pants is very long. Like I pull it up to my bra to not have a saggy butt. I'm 5'4"", ~ 185 pounds.  I ordered XL & while they fit snugly, the xxl would have been huge on the top part, but probably fit looser in the rest of the pants.<br />The pants themselves are cut small. Like I said - very odd pattern/shape to these pants...<br />Good for around the house."
4.0,Just put them in my husband’s shoes he likes them so far. Makes them easier for him to put them on. They only took a few seconds to put in but did have to pull hard to get them through the eyelet. He likes them
4.0,Very nice. They are durable. Easy to wash
4.0,"Comfy shorts, love the zippable pocket feature. The only downside is the built in underwear creates lines."
4.0,"I ordered size small and it fits me fine (5'2&#34;, 95 lbs, B cup).  I like to display my six pack, so I cut it off at the bottom of my rib cage.  For a crop top, Sexy Women Lady Fishnet Sleeveless Vest Mesh Crop Top Shirt from Amazon is already cropped and has a similar style: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B071RK96YN/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&psc=1"
4.0,This dress is a heavier material. Very beautiful. I am pleased with this purchase.
4.0,"These are Chinese made off labeled shorts, so you need to expect that... they forgot to put on a button. Aside from that, I like them!<br />I am 6'1&quot;, 185lbs and usually wear a 33 - I bought the Labelled size 34 and they are slightly snug (fit closer to a label 32).<br />The shorts are stylish and nice looking! The material seems really soft and comfy."
4.0,I got  a medium and  it was  alil big. I could recommend order a size down from what  you  normally wear.
4.0,"I like these makes, they arrived per the advertised schedule. They are comfortable and if needed I will buy again."
4.0,Overall they're pretty good...they rub the wrong places just a bit.  They offer good support however and look great!
4.0,"Cute in photos!. In person, I couldnt help but feel like a go-go dancer, the quality was nice and rubber had a pleasant, subtle but sweet smell that I wasnt expecting."
4.0,"Somewhat small,  but that is a good motivator to hit the gym.  Nice details, very well made.  Thanks."
4.0,Cute shirt. Didn’t wear the headband. Only thing is that the shirt runs small and short.
4.0,Wish the too material was different
4.0,Adorable shoes! They do run true to size! I would not recommend sizing up as other reviews said. I did so and they were too much! I would recommend getting the size your little one currently wears! These are good quality shoes and very cute!!!! I would order again!
4.0,Love these rings my cockatiels try and biting them and they are still holding up. Good quality.
4.0,"Gloves are good.  Been buying this brand for years you can't beat the durability of these gloves.<br />Only PROBLEM is they sent one pair just the right hand gloves, I do have two left feet but I actually have a right and left hand."
4.0,"Its really pretty. I wanted it to be a little bigger than what it is..But its still really cute an dI gifted it to my friend, she said she loved it and got many compliments when she wore it. Although shipping was extremely slow.It took a month or so to get this..I  had almost forgotten abot it. Other than that...very cute"
4.0,"I’m really happy with this blouse. It’s a great find for the low price point. It fits true to size, and is a great addition to my wardrobe. My only complaint is that it’s definitely more sheer than I expected, so you can see my bra through it (see picture). I kind of just leaned into the look and paired it with a black bra to make it seem intentional. If you want a more modest look, pairing it with a tank would look good too. Either way - I’d buy it again."
4.0,I really love my new Bella Taylor handbag. It has 6 outer pockets and is very light. I only wish that it had another section inside. It has 3 slip pockets for credit cards etc. and the zippered pocket for my cash and change. So far I am very satisfied with my purchase.
4.0,"Gave this to the wife and she loved it and its symbolism! The chain not so much , but the pendant she adored. If your looking for a gift symbolizing motherhood for anyone who loves either turtles or Hawaii, this is it!<br />Happy husband because of a very happy wife!"
4.0,"Nice product easy install for my watch , material looks and feels good and looks sturdy,"
4.0,I'm 5'4&#34; 145lbs and I got a medium.  Material feels great but I wish I got a small.  Maybe it'll shrink a little after I wash it.
4.0,"I have a few pair of these Chuck Taylors. These are the kind that do not need to be tied. Very comfortable. However, they don't have much arch support. If you need a lot of cushion in the soles and support in the arches, these are not the shoes for you."
4.0,Great shirt but tight on my husky grandson
4.0,Cute!!  Great for my daughter who loves Frenchies.
4.0,"These rings are just nice to wear as extras along with much nicer, bigger rings........"
4.0,"NOt quite black, but is serving me well as a little purse."
4.0,They are just as displayed
4.0,I really like this dress.. its flowy and light.. super cute for a date.. I put lace shorts under it and it looks even cuter. Wish it came in more colors.

4.0,"A fun top, lots of compliments, but the fabric is a little cheap."
4.0,"The tint is perfect, and the lenses are crystal clear. The bifocal is amazing, it I kind of low but it works out great so you don't see the line all the time. The wood stems are great the only draw back is that the very end has a point that I jabbed myself with the first couple of times but the are very comfortable to wear!"
4.0,I Love them beautiful and comfortable wore them all day but I received the wrong color..I ordered cognac and I received blue navy.. :-(
4.0,All the other foam axes I found online were flimsy and unrealistic. I got several positive comments on this during the Halloween season.
4.0,"These glasses seem surprisingly sturdy, but I did run into a pretty annoying problem. The screw on the hinge kept unscrewing and I would have to constantly screw it back in, but the plastic actually fest pretty solid and had some weight to it so that was a plus. They do the job pretty well!"
4.0,"Beautiful pearl earrings. Just what I wanted. However, the screw backs were very hard to put on and remove. I changed the backings to some that were much easier to put on and take off. Now I am enjoying wearing them."
4.0,It was bought for my son and he loves it.
4.0,"This bracelet is cute, though smaller than expected and less rose gold than regular yellow gold in color."
4.0,Very comfortable dress! I am 5'2&#34; and it hits me right above the knee in the front.
4.0,Its beatiful but a little small<br />If you have a very large neck then it would not fit
4.0,good but too shiny for me.
4.0,"First, it came waaaaaay earlier than I though it would. Second, top fits great and looks like the photo. Third, the bottoms are a little small in that the straps are maybe half as wide as shown and the butt is narrower than pictured. Still, I like it. I ordered a medium."
4.0,"It is a very pretty top. My husband hated the picture but when I put it on, he loved it too. It is made well and the size fits as expected. My only complaint it that the padding requires adjusting more than I like. It tends to move over and look awkward. Despite this I do really like the top."
4.0,"pretty, but was too large."
4.0,"This took a little while to come, however when it did come, it was very nice. For the price I paid, the quality was very nice. The stitching was well done and my boyfriend's brother was very happy with it as I had gotten it for his birthday. I would recommend it to others, it is fairly cheap and is a good novelty item even when not in use."
4.0,"They are good lenses that seem to be what they advertised.  A little lighter than my original lenses, but they do very well in the sun. They fit well in my frames and were easy to insert.  Would definitely order again.  Price was reasonable compared to some of the other vendors."
4.0,Cute retro bathing suit- looks good on my daughter.
4.0,Quality is what you pay for. Pretty but inexpensive plastic but good enough to protect sunglasses. Very compact which is nice for purse or Beachbag.
4.0,Nice fit; soft and hasn’t shrunk!
4.0,It is soft and stylish but a few loose thread
4.0,"The overalls look great for the most part and are VERY lightweight. Definitely to be worn in warmer weather. I had two issues. One was that they were almost too short. Two because they were almost too short and pulled at the straps, the buttons fell off during the first day of wear. I can easily fix this, but it's annoying that after one wear the buttons for the straps broke."
4.0,Fit great and the material seems durable.
4.0,"I bought the 5-7 pack for my 4 year-old (almost 5) son, and they fit him great... which means they won't fit him when he's 7, so they are a little on the small side. He does have a wide foot, so maybe kids with medium width will be ok a little longer. I bought them for the grips on the bottom: my son is pretty clumsy, and slips on our hallway floors all the time if he doesn't wear socks with grips; these work great! They were really nice in the summer; ankle height, and not super thick and hot. Overall, happy with the purchase."
4.0,Gave this to my niece when she turned 16 - she liked it and it was a nice quality bracelet
4.0,Bit too long for size 10
4.0,They run big but still look cute. Mine hang off my waist a bit but not so much they look bad.
4.0,"Nice style, looks great but too tight around shoulders and upper arms."
4.0,"Soft, lightweight, not too long around the neck (which is good for me because I'm short), true to color on the screen. The edges could have been sown a little more neatly but it's still a very nice scarf."
4.0,"These are great quality and super soft, however order a size larger (at least) than you usually wear."
4.0,"It was a very good product, it fit very well, but it was the softest t-shirt."
4.0,He loved how it fits he said he will buy more thank you
4.0,"I love this plaid shirt jacket. The fabric is soft, thick and comfortably warm. I got this jacket to layer on days I don’t feel like wearing a heavy puffy coat. It functions just great in that capacity for me. The 10% wool feels warm and comfortable on. It has functional buttons along the entire length as well as pockets. The Olof and plaid design is very chic and stylish. I have no complaints and would definitely purchase another."
4.0,"I normally wear a size 8, with heavy socks, these are a bit tight with light socks, but I will keep them.  They are comfortable and cute and serve the purpose."
4.0,"Like this underwear it fit just right only thing I was wanting them both to be black not one black or gray that was the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars, but the fit and touch are excellent I'd recommend them to anyone"
4.0,I love the skirt but not the large TAILONG logo on the skirt. I have actually blacked it out.  It's there but you don't see it so prominently
4.0,. . . doesn't come with an insert in order to separate duplicate checks.  I have to insert a piece of cardboard which seems pretty lame for a nice product like this.
4.0,One of the best ones in my collection. Wish the leather was thicker though
4.0,These are very cute but delicate and thin material. Doesn't come with any washing instructions but would highly recommend not to dry them in dryer. Fit as expected and look super cute.
4.0,Looks good Services purpose when on easy took a while to get
4.0,Product is well constructed and looks great for the price.  Also came very fast.. much faster than the charm that I ordered from ebay to go with it. :)
4.0,"FOR LITTLE EARS.  Hard to buy earrings on line - inaccurate or confusing size descriptions seem to be the norm.  These are indeed very very small.  An adult really couldn't wear them but my daughter likes them and they look cute on - she's 10 and almost no clearance below hoop.  In a year or so they won't fit but nice, tight, and safe (no room for it to get hung on anything) for now.  She's had them in 24/7 for the past couple of weeks. Would be good for second piercing or higher on the ear for sure."
4.0,I really like this top. I usually wear a size 8 dress and got this shirt in a Large because the reviews said it ran a little smallish - I wish I would have gotten a Medium. The shirt is really comfy and made from lightweight materials that held up well after the first wash. The neck fits a little funny but I wonder if that's because it is a little big on me.
4.0,Beautiful piece i cant wait to wear it
4.0,"My days are better because of them as now I'm not pulling my pants up constantly, even when having the belt very tight. This &#34;no butt&#34; man has finally found relief."
4.0,great bag...I was hoping it would be a darker red ....to my mind it's not &#34;wine&#34; red.  BUT it is a lovely bag and I so love this shade to that I'll keep it.  I also bought the navy blue one and was sad to find that it is not NAVY....also not dark enough to be the shade as described...but it's lovely just the same and I know I'll enjoy both.
4.0,"This wrinkles easily and shows sweat REALLY easily so while I really like the cut/color/fit, I don't end up wearing it a lot."
4.0,"LOVE THESE HEELS! They are gorgeous in person but beware. I put mine on and was trying to put the strap around my ankle, my finger slipped and went straight through the fishnet. I’m certain I can fix it but def a word of caution. The net is not the strongest. Other than that.....stunning."
4.0,I love them..they are very comfortable the only thing is they are a perfect fit i think next time I'll get them in an 8 instead of 7 1/2  just to give myself a little room.
4.0,"I’m not a suspenders wearer normally, nor a belt-and-suspenders type.  These were a little difficult to attach initially and required some fiddling to get right.  Once I had them properly adjusted, they were quite comfortable.  I like the relatively wide suspender straps. The navy blue color was quietly elegant."
4.0,"This was lovely, I bought two, I only wish the shirts came in different styles"
4.0,"Good bracelet, could be better quality, but for the price its expected. Cute charms. Love it."
4.0,"We purchased these LED Finger Lights for our daughter's 10th birthday Dance Party.  All 40 pieces were in the package although a few of the lights did not work out of the box.  I was ok with that because the price was right.  The lights were nice and bright and the colors were amazing!  The kids loved dancing in the dark with these lights!  Sometimes the rubber bands that attach to the light and your finger would fall off and they were not easy to reattach but a room full of kids really did not care too much.  The kids got to take their cool lights home with them leaving us with a handful left at our house.  The party was a couple of years ago and believe it or not we still have a few of these cool little lights floating around and they still work!!  We have found them useful for our night time walks, not as flashlights but just so we are seen by motorists.  I would buy these again and recommend them to anyone not needing a product that would last a lifetime but something unique, fun, bright and colorful."
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:9bc533c84abc87e9f505bb102bba2cf8]] La tela es excelente y la blusa muy linda tal como en la foto, solo que de los hombros  es muy estrella y de la cintura es muy ancha, tengo 6 meses de embarazo y peso 135 libras compre una S y es muy grande, debí comprar xs, luego de eso es excelente en calidad y queda muy linda"
4.0,Very cute scarf. Wish the material was thicker.
4.0,"These fit nicely but they are a little sheer.  Also, they legs ride up a bit sometimes.  Otherwise they are useful and I love the colors."
4.0,Really good value and my sisters loved them
4.0,Well designed shirt with sizing as expected.  Seams are well sown and the material is cut properly.  Overall a good shirt.
4.0,Good chain but is definitely for a pendant cause this rope chain is not all solid. There is a spot in the chain that is definitely different hence the pendant. Good thing that's what I'm using it for. Also it's a bit shinier than expected but it's  good
4.0,"I really like this dress. The length is perfect for me with 2-3 inch heels (for reference I'm 5'3&#34;), and I really liked the material - lace up top, chiffon-like bottom. The dress had a ton of static in the bottom, but that's typical of this material and is easy to fix. Also, like many others have said, the top part is completely sheer. I was fine with that - wear a nice slip or shapewear and you're good to go. Ultimately, I decided to return this dress because it wasn't the most flattering dress on me and I would be uncomfortable wearing it. I'm pretty...ahem...round, so if you're a little slimmer, then this dress would look great. I would recommend, just not for me."
4.0,Bought this watch to remind my son to drink water.  I programmed it to go off hourly.  It works great!  Only gripe is the programming process.  It’s such a pain!
4.0,A little loose but ok
4.0,Okay. has a small scratch on lens.
4.0,Wouldn't fit. Way too small.
4.0,[[VIDEOID:43140417ab6b330cd507f79d4c35b2fe]] This dress is beautiful. I felt very feminine and girly in it. I’m 5”10 and weigh about 160lbs and I had initially ordered the medium size but I could barely get into it. I exchanged that one for the extra large. It would have gotten 5 stars if it didn’t run small. I also took off points because I feel like they could have done a better job with the red flower details. Overall it is a great dress and i got sooooo many compliments at all the Christmas parties I went to. I would love to use it for a photoshoot. The details really pop in photos. I also believe that the seller should charge about $10 less than they do for it.
4.0,"I ordered these in a 9.5, my usual size, and with or without thin socks the fit is perfect, both in length and width (I have slight bunions, so a wide foot with longer 2nd toe, but narrow heel).  However, without socks, they rub slightly at the heel and inside the foot where the elastic is attached.  I love the color, they way they look on, how easy they are to slip into, and the very non-slippery sole with small drain holes, but not as likely to pick up sand or pebbles as others I tried.<br />Sadly, I wanted shoes for kayaking and/or snorkeling, and would rather not wear socks for either activity, so may return them."
4.0,Its soft and comfy. But the sleeves where made way long.
4.0,Made of really comfortable material. The shoulder fit a little weird.
4.0,"This dress fits well. I'm actually a size 2, and as the evening went on it felt a little big. The dress however is actually fairly comfortable. I would recommend wearing a strapless bra. The material is Heavy enough that I was able to wear underwear. If you are fairly smooth you will NOT NEED a SHAPER. I got many compliments on this dress. It's nice because it can be dressed up or down depending on your acessories.<br />Would have liked a hook and eye in the back, and a better dart in the sleeve would have made it more comfortable. It LOOKS great though."
4.0,"Everyone from church to the restaurant my family went to for brunch loved this dress. I have more hips than waist and breast, but my mother was able to do amazing alterations to make this dress work for me."
4.0,Love it! Very simple design but looks great on and the clasp is nice and tight.
4.0,"I have purchased atleast a dozen tops online from Amazon, a handful of them very similar to this style and fabric and this one seems to be on the shorter/snug in the chest side. The sleeves are the normal length."
4.0,Earrings were great!
4.0,"Very pretty necklace. I actually purchased for a Halloween costume. Suitable to just wear, it’s nice quality and didn’t look cheap."
4.0,I am 5ft & thin. I read reviews about the overalls being small so I got a medium but I felt it was too loose for me so I'm going to get a small one that way it'll fit me better. I am keeping the medium to wear to work & the small for any other day. Will add photos later.
4.0,"I returned these (was very pleased with Gaffo's customer service) because they were smaller than the stated size.  I had looked at many online vendors at this particular model, at varying prices (this was the best price) and I think they are authentic and worth the money that I paid but they are not comparable in weight or finish to the 2 pairs of Ferragamo that I had bought for $275+ in the past from Pearle Vision."
4.0,"A little large and definitely meant for men but the quality is good.<br />Overall, a great product with fantastic lenses and reflection.<br />I only wish such a feminine design was made for women and not men...<br /><br />Disclaimer: Free for review."
4.0,Very satisfied.... It came in a timely manner too!! I love it;)
4.0,This bathing suit is very cute and flattering. It is small in the chest though.
4.0,"Bought these for my 5 year old hiker. We do a lot of 6-10 mile hikes and he needed a pair of grippy boots. He likes the boots, BUT they feel so thin and flat on the bottom that I wonder how his feet don’t bother him. They do a great job sticking to rocks and on steep scrambles. They keep his feet warm. I always carry an extra pair of shoes for him in case the shoes ever are too thin. But he’s made it through multiple long hikes with them and has no complaints."
4.0,Hands stay warm.
4.0,"I forgot I was asian too, and still heeded the advice to order about 2 sizes up. Even though I have a bit of a gut,  it ended up being a bit loose, but the overall quality was nicer than I expected.<br /><br />The chain is decent, it is not made of complete metal, rather a nickel coating of some high durability plastic.<br /><br />The material for the pants was like an off-cotton, not exactly cotton and not 100% polyester. Breathable but only to an extent.<br /><br />I enjoyed the product"
4.0,"They run about 1/2 size small. Buy them 1/2 size bigger than your normal size. It’s only been 6mths and I need a new pair. The material on the toes is very fragile. Whenever I’m working on my knees and my boot toes are on the floor, they have worn holes in the material already. Also, the anti slip sole seems to be not so anti slip anymore from regular debris like sawdust, drywall dust, etc. I love the style. They are very light and comfortable. I’m going to get another pair."
4.0,"Fit well, great for a costume party!"
4.0,"I had to pin the v because it hung too low for school, but overall a great dress! Very thin material, but not see-through. My students loved it!"
4.0,"Love the size and functionality of this, so much better than just an open tote- pockets for water, sunscreen, toys and room for 4-5 towels!  I don’t find it too heavy to carry."
4.0,"Nice looking, love the concept!  Bought these for my girlfriend, She said she must have a big head ( her words, not mine. LOL ) because they were really tight."
4.0,This dress is great price for quality but runs a little big. I am typically a small and ordered that but it is too loose basically all over. Will likely be giving it to a friend or maybe saving it for the future. Would recommend overall but I'd size down!
4.0,"It is pretty small, and it sits sort of wide on my neck so the pieces don't line up perfectly. The color looks very good, it appears to be brushed on then enameled, or lacquered, giving it an appearance of thickness. stones arent glued in super well but could be popped out and done again if I wanted."
4.0,"I had previously purchased a jacket just like this (may even be the same) about 2 years ago<br />at a discount store such as Marshall's and wore it alot and was very satisfied with the<br />fit and longevity, but it finally wore out. This new jacket was exactly as expected and<br />about Twice as cheap as the previous coat. So it is a very good price for a nice jacket.<br />Recommended! Only complaint was that it was stuffed too tightly in the package but<br />seems undamaged."
4.0,I normally wear an XXL but i decided to buy the XL and it was too big. I should have ordered the Large. The color is very nice and the material is very nice too. Very comfortable. I returned it and bought the short sleeve one.
4.0,I have the shiny gold pandora bracelet but this keeps it from moving and is a lot cheaper than the ones at pandora. I’ll update after a month to let you know how it wears as far as fading but for the price you can’t beat it.
4.0,My grandson has Autism and he really enjoys the scarves and ribbons.  The ribbons did come apart from the sticks fairly easily.  He still uses the ribbons without the stick and is very happy with them.
4.0,The waist trainer came in a 36 and I think its a medium when I asked for a large. I might exchange it for a 38 though.
4.0,"Love the bag's look, but the smell is overpowering. It seemed better after a few day in the sun. People love the bag, it's attractive, durable, and practical; and a few months later, the smell dissipated."
4.0,Nice material but very big
4.0,I thought this was a faux vest but....there IS pockets.<br />They sew up the pockets completely instead of just sewing an inch to keep form.<br />Vest ii good. Fits well.
4.0,"This is a very nice pair of animal friendly earmuffs.  The band isn't too tight and doesn't hurt your head after wearing for a while, and the tan color (which I received) is neutral and goes with most of my sweaters and coats.<br /><br />The tan version has threads of silver tinsel woven into them, which gives a bit more of a young style to the earmuffs, more like a holiday look or something from Claire's.  I personally don't like glittery headwear so I could have done without it, but it's not so prominent that they look like full on glitter pom poms."
4.0,They are good quality.
4.0,arrived on time and fit fine
4.0,"The quality of the eye is great, but you might want to purchase a better chain.  The clasp on this one broke fairly easily."
4.0,They are comfortable  and great quality just a bit bigger than expected
4.0,The backs for these earrings barely held them in my ears.  I lost one right away.  Luckily it was found and I put new backs on them.  Otherwise very cute.
4.0,The pack does it's job and isn't outlandish or anything. The only issue I have with it is it's mouth piece easily comes off so you have to be careful opening it. That's a hindrance when trying to ruck or race. Otherwise fine.
4.0,They are warm but they are too thick to actually text with.
4.0,Pair it with black jeans (that’s what we did) or your own pair of black pants.  They were huge!  But my son looked so good in his outfit!!!
4.0,Good quality material. The fringes are starting to come off due to frequent use but otherwise great
4.0,I really loved this it fit great! My waste is 27inches and wore it a couple of times and it hasn't lost its elasticity
4.0,Acupression
4.0,I Like the shirt but not an enthusiastic fan of the material. It is a good top and probably will order some other colors.
4.0,Size up for a loser fit
4.0,"Nice Dress! Bought for nun costume funny enough, but would actually wear it in real life! Has nice stretch, fabric isn’t flimsy"
4.0,Looks nice. Haven't used yet but seems to fit the bill...
4.0,"Great for the price. If you have a butt, it does ride up in the back."
4.0,This slit is very small and it only is able to hold the very thin aluminum coins /tokens it doesn’t hold the thicker Chips that are nicer
4.0,This outfit was so cute and my grandson looked adorable in it.
4.0,"Love the bracelet. Only problem is that their is no give between the beads, so if you're like me will long arm hair this thing will tug on it all day... its painful. It wasn't easy but I have to undue the ties on either end of the beads to give the beads some gaps. Since then... It's my favorite bracelet to wear."
4.0,Nice key chain even if I would pay a little more for a better quality
4.0,"Compared to another pair I have the elastic inside is very loose. The size is the same, however these are atleast 3x bigger. 4 stars because I was able to remedy this with my own sewing machine and I enjoy the plastic clasps as I broke out due to previous metal ones I have had."
4.0,"We bought for a WDW trip in September, so fabric weight is perfect. Like T-shirt material. Granddaughter wears a 4T we ordered a 6 and it’s a shade large, but plenty of growing room. We got the Snow White dress from same vendor, same size and it’s verging on too small. That one will need shorts now as too small for a true dress. Found it odd the sizing was so varied by same vendor. I ordered 5 different styles, and the more “structured” dresses tended to run smaller"
4.0,"Great hat,  brim is kinda hard on the forehead but I covered it with bandage and gauze"
4.0,Very cute! true to size.
4.0,I've purchased two. I'll purchase more.
4.0,These matching bracelets are nice.  Well made and pretty durable.  They have a bit of heft to them but not too bad.  They are very difficult to put on without assistance.  Also they really are not adjustable so if it is too large it is a major undertaking (removing the jump ring and then removing some links then reattaching the jump ring).  It is nice that they really don't get snagged in my arm hair.  I have to wear and ESD band at work but this really doesn't interfere with that.  The finish seems to be holding up pretty well.
4.0,really like this.<br />Was a little larger than I expected.<br />Would appreciate if they made it with snaps or a zipper of hooks
4.0,"I think the pendant is beautiful, but I will agree with the other reviewers that the chain is too delicate. But gave 4 stars since it is should a good price."
4.0,Definitely size down to avoid looking like a shapeless void.
4.0,It is a cute mask.  Very soft and comfortable.  The only issue we have is in the lengths of loops that go over the ears.  Both of our masks have different sized loops so the cat nose is noticeably off center.
4.0,Love it!.....only has fringes on 1 side of sweater though... just need to iron all wrinkles out for 1st wear....smelled like mildew when I opened package.
4.0,It’s cool. I can tell it was hand made.<br />But I wear it to work so I’m ok with it. It’s really warm.
4.0,"Recently, got a real bad case of poison sumac. on my face and neck from working outside with my new sthil string trimmer. looked everywhere locally, nothing like this to be found ANYWHERE. so i came on to amazon and ordered this. used today 7/9/15 with temps in the 80's and humidity over 70 percent. this fabric is light weight and comfortable. I put safety glasses on before i went outside so my entire face and neck were completely covered. seemed to do what it's supposed to do.<br />however after about 45 minutes or so, you can really see/start to feel the sweat soaking through. i will update at a later time."
4.0,Bought my husband size 10 and should have gone up to 10.5 he thought they were tight. They should stretch some
4.0,They are very pretty. I bought them as a gift for a young girl.
4.0,"Love the look that blends in with my favorite casual clothes. I am not liking the zipper due ty o it being hard to start. Might use wax on it, though to give it a boost."
4.0,"I really like the designs, they are very cute. I wash them and they stayed true to size. The only thing I wish the wire was thicker at the nose because it’s very thin. But I would buy them again."
4.0,Wish the garnets were more red than orange.
4.0,"Very cute, go size bigger. Don't expect best quality for the price."
4.0,"Fit comfortable, wear work"
4.0,"Nice, but way too small."
4.0,Nice necklace. I really likr the tree of life design with the wire. The chain is not real heavy but nice. I also like that it comes with the extender so you have two choices of lenght. The crystal is pretty and not heavy. Comes in a nice box and includes a pouch for safe keeping. All ready for gift giving.
4.0,This is super super cute! The outfit is a bit big for a newborn however. The bottom is huge. Way bigger than what it looks like in this pic. The babe I photographed was 7lbs and her whole body fit into it. The chest stars are also very wide set.
4.0,"very cute dress! I got tons of compliments in it. At first I was worried it would be itchy, but it's not too bad once you've washed it. The color is just like the picture (I got the gold). I does come with an under dress, however it is somewhat sheer, so I wore another slip underneath. Worth the money!"
4.0,Great fit !  Tons of pockets and seperate spaces
4.0,Fits acer 11.6  Chromebook  perfectly with just enough extra room. I bought this hoping  it would fit  (given the few bad reviews) but it’s great . Now I just hope they don’t ground all domestic flights...
4.0,"I love it.  Deadly accurate, comfortable to wear, made to last and dirt cheap.  The backlight is horrible and the matte finish wears off quickly but at 10 bucks these are barely even concerns."
4.0,"Good gloves for the price point. Kept the hands warm and dry this morning, 20 degrees on a 5am dog run. Outside for an hour. Only complaint is that they are a bit bulky, but that's to be expected."
4.0,"I am the buyers spouse and this gift was for me. It's a fantastic product. The colors are vibrant and the fabric is soft. I wore it all night at a concert and for a long drive to and fro. It was extremely comfortable and made me feel like a magical fairy. I love it! I only wish the wings had a wrist or finger strap to keep my hands free while I spread my wings, because as it is now I have to cling to the edge of the fabric in order to spread my wings."
4.0,Nice idea but difficult to push it back into the fabric afterward.
4.0,"My daughter typically wears a 7/8 so I ordered a size bigger hoping she'd be able to wear it for longer, but it was still short in the ankles. She still loves it. Wore it for a Halloween costume and occasionally around the house."
4.0,Got this as a gift for my brother. He's a big guy and it still fits him perfectly. He got a 3XT hoodie from another name brand but that one was too small. Definitely satisfied with this purchase.
4.0,Got it for me and my sister and we love it they are so cute and the keychains didn’t come off yet and I had it for months now love it 🫶
4.0,"Maybe I'm just too old school. When I hear hoodie I'm thinking of a cotton (or blend) with the fluffy fleecy inside. This just isn't that kind of hoodie. My kiddo (11y girl) said it feels like swimsuit fabric! It's thicker than that but it does have a smooth and totally artificial kind of feel to it. It's just not what I'm used to in a hoodie. That doesn't make it bad though. I've worn it few times in our East Coast fall chill and it holds up to a chilly (though not cold) day. The fabric breaths okay and doesn't feel bad on my skin. It just feels like a more sporty kind of fabric.<br /><br />I've only washed it once so far and it didn't change shape or size and the printing seems to be holding up well, and I anticipate no issues in that regard. The overall construction is fine with no loose or hanging threads, no missed stitches that I can find, of fabric issues.<br /><br />I'm a big guy and I usually choose 2x for shirts. I can wear most XL fine but I like extra room and on the off chance I get a 2x that runs small it will still fit. This falls into the latter category, it runs a bit smaller than I expected for a hoodie. Hoodies usually run a bit larger (presumably because they are meant to be worn over other shirts). The 2x fits me comfortably but not the loose baggy fit that I usually get in the typical 2x hoodie, so if you like a loose fit you might go up a size (I think 2x was the largest size option when I got mine). It is long enough that it doesn't ride up over my waist and the arms have a bit of length such that neither feels short-changed.<br /><br />As to the design, well that's kind of a personal preference. I chose the racoon with the rainbow and I find the happy trash panda delightful! The printing itself is well done though without color bleed or fuzzy edges.<br /><br />All in all I'm happy and I'm rating 4 stars, which is good but not superb and that's how I feel about the hoodie."
4.0,"From an older, chubby woman.  This dress looked nice and made me feel moderately attractive.  Well worth the money!"
4.0,Gift for Granddaughter
4.0,Okay quality for the price.
4.0,"I'm short. 5'1"" short. So they obviously dont look as shown on me, but with some super sexy heels I will make it work."
4.0,It would be 5 stars but they definitely run small
4.0,"It is what I expected, a lightweight practice jersey. Be sure to order the next size up as they run small"
4.0,I love this dress perfect fit
4.0,"These are very cute. The material seems slightly thin, but overall these should work very well as socks for son."
4.0,I was buying a heavier weight sock with less compression. These are thinner and tighter than I like. I found the older version but at a higher price. The are holding up so far but I question the durability of the lighter material. I will update<br />if things change
4.0,"Definitely wide, but small and perfect for that no earrings earring look, LOL.  Closure isn't the sturdiest.  I have had to adjust a couple times."
4.0,"My wife is very happy with this cardigan sweater! It's comfortable, and the medium size was a good fit (she's 5' 2"" and about 120 pounds). The workmanship seems good, and it strikes the right balance between being warm but not TOO warm. She especially likes the sleeves, which have enough elastic (or something stretchy) to lightly grip her forearms (she likened it to the way a turtleneck form fits to your neck).<br /><br />I've seen some complaints about colors, but we ordered black and are happy with it. All in all, a nice addition to the wardrobe with colder weather coming in!"
4.0,More like a cotton Lycra material. So this is not see through (like you might expect from the description). But the colors are good and the style is cute. Still a great purchase.
4.0,I like this product but wish there had been dimensions for the different sizes as I would have ordered the medium instead of the small.
4.0,Tight fit. But thin enough to breath in
4.0,"They are comfortable and true to size (I'm a size 9). i found the straps to be pretty good. They don't dig or seem misplaced. I haven't worn them out yet, just around the house. But I feel like I could wear them all day, or at least a couple hours."
4.0,"It's a great size, fits over my whole head and has a little bit of neck too so i can tuck it into a shirt. The glow int the dark is very effective. It's not something you can wear for too long, as it's hard to breathe - but then again you're wearing a massive full-head latex mask so that wouldn't be easy to achieve..."
4.0,Great fit and serves its purpose greatly.
4.0,"nice ring, comfortable, fits accurately and looks just like the picture."
4.0,"They shed a little bit, but for the price you can't beat these.  They held up through a night of drunken dancing at a Halloween party, and hopefully will get some more use next year.  Not too itchy, and fit just right."
4.0,I am 5' 7-3/4&#34; tall and they were still a little long for me but I liked them that way.  The fit is great and I like it for the summer; not too thick. Just right for me.
4.0,"No, the t-shirts did not shrink in the dryer. I'm in between M and L. So I ordered two and they fit as expected: M is not too tight and L is a bit loose on me. My chest is 37"" and waist - 32"". Even if they shrink half a size, once you put them on they will stretch to their size. What I don't like about them is the fabric - super stiff, doesn't feel good. Will be wearing them while working in the garden."
4.0,Pretty long my son is 5'8&#34; and they were long on him.  Material doesn't feel so soft.  I guess they're worth the price
4.0,"The size and contoured fit were great.  The inner pocket to accommodate a filter pad is a nice feature because you could use a filter or not and still have at least two layers of material.  Fyi the vent has one layer of material over it which means you won't be freely spreading droplets to others.<br /><br />The one area that needs an hoofs is the strap which is a very light duty fabric/elastic that totally lost its stretch after two days.  But it is very easy to replace because the strap is not anchored with stitching, it is fed through a tube of fabric.<br /><br />In short this is worth buying because of the contoured fit and comfort level even with the added hassle of replacing the straps."
4.0,"Very nice 👌 sweater, I usually wear a XXL but I rolled the dice and got an XL. It's a tad too small ......"
4.0,"Bellos, pero muy pequeño parecía un poco más grandes"
4.0,Well pleased with product.
4.0,"Cute but some tops glued crooked, one has inside falling out. Tops seem to be plastic of soft metal. Do not try to take tops off to fix or they break."
4.0,Bought mine direct from Sea-Doo.  They ran a size larger than my usual size and I still have 1/2 inch to spare.. They are also wide.  Very comfortable and drain/dry fast.
4.0,These are good Croc knock-offs. The rubber is a little thinner and more pliant but beyond that I don’t see a difference. As a bonus they include a dinosaur charm for each shoe.  If you’re looking to save a little money over the name brand I recommend them.
4.0,"Felt great, fit as described. Wish there were different colors to choose from. Would recommend."
4.0,This is nice and I’ve gotten compliments. But material a little more flimsy then I expected.
4.0,Ledhill Geneva Crystal Rivet Wrap Bracelet Wrist Watch (White) Lovely!
4.0,"If I could justify having extra swimsuits I’d buy one of these in every color. I only wear the top. (The shorts roll up my thighs and look like weird panties.) The top is great for the price. I would not recommend this suit if you are looking for something to aggressively swim in or if you are over a D cup, but for my purposes— mild water aerobics, sunbathing, and goofing off with my son—this top is awesome."
4.0,"Good product. Keeps my face warm, it's just too small pulls my chin back."
4.0,They do help to keep my feet warm. Could have a little more down.
4.0,I got a couple of item through this brand. For men or women.  The quality and the size and the color is usually correct never had to return it.
4.0,Odd assortment but good quality
4.0,nice necklace but i think its overpriced
4.0,"This is a well made jacket that is a great value. The XL is a little larger than anticipated, but gives me room for layering"
4.0,"Love the look and how they work but they are a little tight on the nose. I need to wear these all day for my dry eye so with them being tight its a little uncomfortable but they really work pretty good for keep the air out of my eyes. I sit on the porch with these and a hoodie and it really makes a difference for my poor old eyes. If you have dry eyes and its hard to go outside because of the cold, wind or dryness, i would suggest you try these. There are plenty of dry eye glasses out there but they look terrible and cause some blind spots. These have blind spots too but they look so much better. Hope this review helps some other dry eye sufferer, lord knows we need all the help we can get!"
4.0,The fringe part of the earring is good quality and the colors are great but the white bead cheapens them. It’s nit even a bead it looks like white clay from a kids craft project that dried and never was painted.
4.0,Make sure you get a size larger than you wear. I read the reviews and followed this advice. For that reason the product fits. Otherwise it would not have fit. A little pricey but you pay for the humor. Don’t expect it to last too long since it is a screen print. But fun for now.
4.0,Longer than expected but easy to hem.
4.0,"Exactly what I was afraid of happened, but I minimized it best I could. My jacket is a hair too large and the paints a hair too tight... I'm starting a new career soon and I'll have to dress up some (especially for interviews), so I've been buying a lot of clothes from Amazon lately. I've been ordering size large and almost everything has fit well. Based on other reviews for this suit, I ordered XL instead. Im planning to loose some weight, when I do, I'll definitely need to take in the jacket a bit, but the pants should be about right then. I will need to hem the pant legs a 1/2 inch (I have bad knees and can't wear any kind of heels). If it helps anyone I'm 5'7"", 174lbs, and 36A.<br /><br />Overall it looks nice, nice material. I got complements on the pictures I showed at work. Its a great start to buying a whole new wardrobe without spending a ton of money... so I think I'm all set for interviews... I'm debating about ordering a second suit in a different color too!<br /><br />Edit: I ended up buying a blue suit too, the pants are HUGE!!! The blue XL Jacket appears to be the same size maybe a tiny bit bigger than the black XL suit... The black pants fit nicely in the legs (a little more flowy than I prefer), hit just at the bottom of my foot (I'm going to have hemmed 1/2 inch), and fit comfortably in the seat (zip comfortably) but the button is pretty tight at the waist... the same size blue pants I'll need to have hemmed at least a few inches and the legs are so wide that I'm going to ask the tailor if they can be narrowed some. The waist is so big I was able to shimmy them off without unbuttoning them (very big difference than the black suit I bought only a week earlier)<br /><br />So be warned that there's incansistancies with sizing... Even so, if I need more suits, I'd still consider this one."
4.0,"For costume jewelry,  it's very pretty."
4.0,THIS ITEM FIT WELL AND ALSO LOOKS GOOD.
4.0,"Me encantó la falda, su color es muy bonito y es de muy buena calidad, se ve muy bien"
4.0,A little tight!
4.0,"Seems to be good quality,  just wish it was a little bigger"
4.0,These goggles are very comfortable but I have leaking problems when adjusting during workouts.
4.0,"Glad they sent a 3X. Heavy weight t shirt. It barely fits and gives me no wiggle room. The idea is great, but when you dress yourself and have skin tight clothing, that doesn't work so well, even with snaps. I was hoping that I would be able to pull the sides around to the front area to be able to snap it shut.<br /><br />I am not obese, but I am overweight. If you are skinny as a rail, I'd still order at least 2 sizes larger if you want a more roomier fit.<br /><br />I gave 4 stars because my surgery nurses loved this idea and the fact that I purchased this shirt to get me home from surgery and to my post op appointments. I would lower the rating to a 2 star because of the very small sizing."
4.0,Just the way I wanted them
4.0,"It's not as dark as pictured (the black version) but the cat is cute and so far it's sturdy but beware, it does not hold a lot."
4.0,Delivery well before expected-3 weeks early. Exactly what the picture looks like. It is small so...remember to order much bigger. I am 6'1-195lbs and U.S. Large (Asian XXL) barely works. Could lose the extra 5-10 pounds anyway!
4.0,"The jacket was a bit smaller than I was expecting, but still fit, just a little difficult to lift arms above head.Otherwise the cosplay was very well made, beside part of the skirt ribbon not lining up, but nothing detrimental."
4.0,Perfect gift for me and my best friend! She loved it! Pretty decent quality! Overall I was happy with this purchase! 😀
4.0,It does the job perfectly but I didn’t know that there are a such thing as size when it comes to the trainer. I like the one here but will definitely buy me another one in a larger size
4.0,"A little too large, but perfect picture quality and very soft."
4.0,This is a gift.  It is too cute.
4.0,"Super cute.  I'm taking it to the bull riding rodeo in Vegas and it'll go with the plaid shirts I am bringing.  It fits pretty well, a tad large, but okay.  It's a little more dressy than the other hat I ordered, the Scala beaded straw, and that was what I wanted.  It is a fashion hat not an actual cowboy hat."
4.0,Si tuvieran broches en lugar de Velcro estarían mucho mejor
4.0,Nice bag but had to return because it was too small for what I needed
4.0,"I have another pair of this brand, and although they are a bit different I'm happy with these as well.  They are a bit shorter than my others, but I'm tall and like my pants to come at least all the way to my ankle.  They're extremely comfortable and I love the pull on pants which don't leave a bulge on your tummy like zip pants."
4.0,the earrings are 1 piece except for ear wires
4.0,"Just wish the shirt was a little longer.  I'm tall, so that's probably why it wasn't long enough for me."
4.0,"Mine are a little too large, so I'm not wearing them now, but they are very nice."
4.0,I would not say this is well made but for the price it worked for me with a bejeweled sweater for a Christmas dinner.
4.0,"I am 5'3 and this shirt is short, it would be a crop top on someone taller. Cheap material, but that's what I paid for I guess. Just know it will ride up on you."
4.0,"Very pretty, decent quality. Only thing I didn't like was the string, so I took it off and am making my own necklace with hemp. :)"
4.0,It was a little smaller than I was expecting other than that it is very nice. The rose gold color is pretty and the crystals are very sparkly. It's dainty but cute and sweet. It came with a nice ring box to present it in. My 12 yr old daughter loved it for Christmas.
4.0,"It is cute and when she is able to wear it I think it will be fine, it is a bit big. I ordered the 120, my child is 7 yr old, 47 in tall and 50 lbs, she is in a solid size 6 normally so hope that helps with your sizing."
4.0,"Perfect watch at a $72 Unexpected gift ,might not be gift"
4.0,I would’ve given it five stars however after a few times wearing them my skin started ripping on my big toe which ended up being a painful feeling. The arch support and everything else was great.
4.0,as little difficult to get unattached but really like the way it looks.
4.0,Good value for the price. The shoulder straps are a bit cumbersome.
4.0,"Beautiful and sparkly!  4 stars because 1st one arrived broken.  Didnt fool with returning, just ordered another pair.  So thats My fault but still dissapointing.  2 nd set perfect :-)"
4.0,"It's been a loooong time since I've worn Timberlands. I'm an 8 1/2 in Nike's and ordered an 8 1/2. They fit pretty good with regular socks, not sure about thicker ones. I've worn them with the laces untied to give more range with my ankles- looove it!! Foot stays in place.  If I find myself needing more ankle support, I'll just lace them up. *I read they are NOT water proof, so I treated them with a spray."
4.0,"The dress is beautiful and exactly how pictured, but for me the size ran a little larger. I know there are a lot of reviews saying to get one size up but I would go one size down."
4.0,I wish I had bought a size small so it would fit a little bit snugger. But nice layering top.
4.0,It was made of good quality but it was too small and I have it here to return it
4.0,"This is a cute dress. I liked it. I thought it was flattering. I thought the fit was a not perfect, which is why I took off a star. It has no stretch so the size I normally get in every type of dress was a little small. Because of the way it has a seem on the thighs, it might be problematic for someone who is larger there. Other than that, I thought that it was unique and looked good.<br /><br />It wasn't too hot, which for me is important since we live in Florida.<br /><br />It wasn't too hard to clean. I thought it seemed trendy. It felt durable and the fabric was relatively soft. It would work in a wide variety of settings.<br /><br />It was as described and I would recommend it."
4.0,"This top is really cute with a pair of skinny jeans and boots.  I am 5'9&#34; and am about 195lbs, I am a 38DDD.  I could have gone with an XL, but the L was fine.  The material was thin but not see through.  It is a nice top."
4.0,looks good and functional too. Can take on few items like Phones and keys and some make-up.
4.0,"These sizes are in UK so I had to reorder. The material does have a nice elasticity to it, but I would say it’s rather thin and sheer. The white tank is practically see-through. They make good under shirts and feel comfy."
4.0,It is very well made and sparkly.  Just wish it was a couple inches longer.  Well worth the money!<br /><br />WPJ
4.0,It did the trick... thought it would have been a little thicker but you get what you pay for.
4.0,I received my pants today. They feel wonderfully soft but I would say they run to being large. I am 5’4” and am at the upper end of my weight at 145 pounds. I carry my weight around my middle. I think I could have worn a small easily. They are long and the waist is way up past mid rise. I hate returning things so I will keep them and wear them with a longer sweater. They do not fit like leggings. They are totally baggy in the legs. I am wondering if these were mislabeled in terms of the size. I think that I could have worn a small and maybe even an XS. They are big. I am heading to the washing machine and dryer and am hoping they will shrink some.
4.0,This came really quickly and the person I gave it to as a gift loved it!
4.0,"The sleeves are very soft and comfortable. I should have gotten a smaller size, but love them any way."
4.0,I usually order a M in american dresses sizes  but I went with the XL for the the black swan dress as recomended and it fits well.  Quality is good and i added an underskirt for extra puff. The waist belt is a little too large and flimsy.
4.0,"Love the classic design and the flatness (I was looking for a dress clip for the small of my back) . Unfortunately, the gem in the middle fell off during shipping so I had to return it. Small gems are notoriously difficult to maintain. I would love the design more if it was solid metal, and if the side rings were hidden in the back."
4.0,"These do help me to reduce leg swelling which was a chronic problem for me in my fitness training.  The foot tabs are uncomfortable for me inside shoes, but this may vary for others.  I wash these in a delicate wash bag and hang dry, and they have held up decently considering how much use I put into them, though they have stretched out a little.  I could not afford these full price but for the sale price I got them they are by far the best value of any compression pants I have found, in lieu of any really affordable options in quality compression wear."
4.0,"Very comfortable, casual shoe.  Good to wear to work all day, not good if you plan to do a lot of walking."
4.0,Beautiful statement piece. Bought the XL and it looked great but couldn't zip at the bust. Sad to  return!
4.0,"Cool set, but Elvis' head was cut off on the towel"
4.0,Very cute. Quality is not the best but for the money it is great.
4.0,Honestly the material is low quality and the strings you have to put in yourself. Its difficult to insert them. The string task alone with take you 10-20 minutes.<br />It's great for a costume but don't expect anything of quality.
4.0,"Recently bought this item for my niece, it took awhile to get there but it was worth the wait, good quality and most of all my niece loved it!"
4.0,"The dress is so cute,  Ut too small for me. Wanted an XXL. If they get it, I’ll buy it again, but had to send back."
4.0,Pretty cool . Nice colors and quality is great . R5t t tf z
4.0,My wife likes it a lot. Her only complaint is that the opening at the top is pretty stiff making it a bit difficult to get items in and out.
4.0,These are great for sleep or for a loose workout shirt. Leaves room in the belly which may be too big for some and just right for guys with a little bit of a beer belly.
4.0,This dress is beautiful the fabric is of high quality the lace is beautiful the only reason that I am returning it is because the fourth corset ribbon is sewn shut so it's unusable. Will reorder.
4.0,"The frames had a pinkish tone to colour,  would have preferred black frames"
4.0,Look nice as pictured the only problem is they can slide down a bit as you wear them through the day.
4.0,wife likes
4.0,"The top is great for the office or for a night out. I do wear a cammi under mine. Black, salmon,  or tan.<br />Only complaint is the tiny buttons, so I slip it in and off over my head."
4.0,Very cute and thick material. Fits smaller so size up.
4.0,"It has something to do with whatever coating is on the glasses mixed with my car's window tint, but all I see are horizontal muted rainbow lines that distracts and distorts my vision. So unsafe while driving, but they're comfortable and otherwise good, hence the 4 stars. Just 1 star off for the unsafe driving, and these are now my beach/hike/market glasses."
4.0,"It's a bit small, made for smaller watches. Bought this for my boyfriend's watch, he has a G-Shock. Had a hard time putting the piece thought the clasp itself. Had to really wrestle with it and I wasn't sure if it would snap  like a rubber band. It is a little tight, but it does fit both bands, it's just snug as you can see in the pictures."
4.0,Cute but I am not big on the color choice I picked. I wear more black and tried to switch it up but still cute and will wear. Just my preference. Fits nice and looks good.
4.0,Can’t beat Born quality.  Super comfortable and very well made.
4.0,Don’t know too much about it. Bought it for my boyfriend. He really likes it so I guess it’s good!
4.0,These are a little big - probably 0G. I will wear them when I size up
4.0,Dress is more yellow than it appears on the my screen (not a good color on me). The shoulders are more narrow than other dresses of this style. If I'm in a dress I have to be comfortable so it goes back.
4.0,"Excellent capacity and strap length. It’s the perfect size for me. I was looking for a crossbody type bag that could comfortably carry all of my daily carry items and a book or two if needed. This definitely delivers. Downside is the lack of pockets. I like a lot of pockets to keep my stuff organized. This has one inner zipper pocket and two open pockets, so it is definitely lacking in that regard. I ended up having to buy a purse organizer to keep things straight, but this is a tote bag, after all. Would buy again in a different pattern."
4.0,We like them for winter and wet weather. Son will only wear these vs. regular snow boots. They are actually water proof!
4.0,"Nice product. Well made. Leather with elastic ends, attached with tightly wrapped wires, used to grab the glasses ear pieces. The only negative comment would be that some glasses designs have ear pieces that are too slim to hold the elastic ends and therefore, slip-off frequently even though the tensioner band may be set to tighten the strap."
4.0,"Good value, and fun pirate hats. Will work for a silly costume. Some of the skull prints are totally off-center though."
4.0,Very sturdy doesn’t feel cheap at all
4.0,Awesome print. Nice vibrant colors. Don't forget it's a juniors size. I'm usually a womens med so I got an xl and fit great. Material also stretchs nicley. Arrived a few days after expected.
4.0,great but a little thin
4.0,"Many a compliment. Lost the zipper tag, though. Could be me, since it's my daily bag."
4.0,This bag is gorgeous! I read some reviews before purchasing and some said theirs came with a cheetah pattern interior which make me a little hesitant to buy. I received my bag on delivery date and it was packaged perfectly. The inside of my bag is all black and the bag is beautiful in person. It does not look cheap at all.
4.0,"First off, I will say this is an extremely comfy shirt. I’m excited to wear this fall as the cut and fabric are perfect for fall weather. I like the waffle material and the fabric feels weighted and quality. The shirt definitely runs large so keep that in mind will ordering. I am 5’4” about 150lbs and the medium is still quite baggy on me. I wish I had gone down at least one more size. I might have it taken in or just wear it with leggings only."
4.0,"Doesn't have a clasp, you have to slide it over your head to get it on. It's a cute piece of cheap jewelry. My only issue is it keeps flipping and you can't see the eye. Which sucks, because i really like this necklace!"
4.0,"I ordered the 229 Black style, which has the squared edges, not the round aviators. I like the unique shape, makes a round face shape look a little less round.<br /><br />The lenses on this one are plastic, not glass, which I prefer so as not to make them so heavy. They are comfortable enough on the nose, again, because they're not so heavy.<br /><br />The lenses on this pair are black, which do a good job of blocking out the sun. Actually, they does a better job than some other sunglasses I have, which have slightly lighter colored lenses.<br /><br />The arms are sturdy, and comfortable over my ears. The quality of the arms is good, not easily bendable. I was worried that they would be to light and fragile, which is NOT the case. They feel well made.<br /><br />They do not come with a carrying case, but I'm ok with that. First of, based on the price, I wouldn't expect a case with them. Also, while the cases are a nice touch for storage, they tend to take up a lot of room. I have other glasses with cases and they just get too bulky in my pocket, purse or even stored. These come with a soft bag, that can also be used to clean the glasses. The bag is fine by me because it saves room in my car center console.<br /><br />They look pretty cool too.<br /><br />Are these comparable to $100 - $200 sunglasses? No, but you shouldn't expect them to be for this low price point. All in all, a good pair of sunglasses. However, for the price point, they're a pretty nice pair of glasses. I would buy again."
4.0,"I really like the material, it's a little stretchy and a little thicker than most shirts. But I do feel like it runs a little small. I ordered a 4t for my 2 year old. She usually wears 3t but I wanted some shirts she could grow into, so I sized up, and it fits her perfectly right now."
4.0,Very spacious but feels just a little bit flimsy
4.0,"This dress is really cute, but doesn't fit like it shows on the picture. The top part is tight and fitted. In order to fit as loosely as on the picture, you'd have to order at least 2 sized up probably. But I like it as it is. Will keep!"
4.0,"was a little bigger than expected, the design is nice though and the material is good as well"
4.0,"Soft and Plush, comfortable to wear. The fabric is obviously thicker than regular socks with extra thick and furry inside layer that does not shed. Definitely, much warmer and ideal for colder weather. Not quite water wicking though but will keep moisture away from skin to prevent clammy condition. As far as fittings, I think my size 9 feet should fit fine with both offering sizes (M or L). Great winter socks to keep my feet warm during Winter months."
4.0,"The color is beautifully bright with soft fabric!!!! The material remained this way after I washed it before wearing to an event. Length is perfect and the girls stayed in place, lol I wish I would have tordered one size smaller but I was afraid it may have been to tight in the hips and tummy, I was wrong it runs big but I can make it work!!!! I would purchase from seller again 🙂<br />My BF lives the dress!!!!"
4.0,This was a gift for my 14 year old niece.  She likes it and I thought it was simple and nice.
4.0,"Ordered size 4 since the other Nine West pants I have purchased fit. These were larger & stretch out. I’m 5’7”, 128 lbs. love their pants but wish was more true to size. They don’t sell size 2."
4.0,The dress is great material and I loved the dress!!  The only issue was it was a lot bigger than I expected and I would have to order a size smaller than normal.
4.0,"Fits as expected.  Arms are a regular fit not as tight as I thought they would  be but it's at a comfortable tightness  after my recent brachioplasty. I love the front hooks, makes it easier to remove it as necessary."
4.0,Absolutely love this bathing suit however as soon as I got it and tried it on the clasp on the back broke. Even if it hadn't broken the class didn't exactly fit together in a way that was Secure. I didn't send it back in because my cousin was able to sew it together after she did that it was perfect
4.0,My husband works outside and will be using it this winter. The mask is not very thick but thin and feels light and breathable unlike other ski mask. We live in Texas where our winters are not as cold as others and this is perfect for those inbetween days. Bonus bandanna that I use as a headband is a plus!
4.0,"nice little wallet, very convenient..just wish the zipper part was a little bigger."
4.0,good for the price and lloks nice
4.0,"They fit well, however, they do somewhat slide on me. I'm a size 8 shoe, bought the respective size for sock."
4.0,"I enjoy the belt , it has a stretch but its a strong pull not super easy . My only complaint would be the little pull tab to help open it . its a lil too chintzy . thin breakable string."
4.0,Fits good. Good quality
4.0,Nice keychain/clip. Not good for a bunch of keys though. Too many keys bulks it down quickly as the spacing between the clip and key ring is compact.
4.0,Looks great and fit perfect
4.0,Fits to larger even the small size
4.0,I like the ability it has to hold a number of cards and the elasticity it has to change that amount.<br />I'm Not So Satisfied with the money clip. It loses its retention quickly.
4.0,It was exactly as expected.  A very good buy for the money.
4.0,"This worked great for my treasure troll costume! A little disappointed that it kept falling and the white netting underneath would show.  But with a little help from a co worker we teased and sprayed it and ended up with a great crazy troll hair do! For the price, I was extremely happy with the purchase!"
4.0,"Overall great quality coat, and would keep me very warm. Only problem is that it runs a size bigger. I am usually a small so I ordered a small but it’s way too big on me and looks more like a medium :( I would recommend going one size smaller for this jacket"
4.0,"Comfortable & easy to wash. Fabric is ok, seems it may fade quickly, shows every stain. However, for the price, it is worth it. Had someone compliment me on this dress at the grocery store."
4.0,"It was a bit heavier than I expected.  I am not complaining, I actually like the weight of the fabric.  The color is nice."
4.0,very nice product for the cost.
4.0,"Pads are weird but when removed worked just fine. I recommend getting black ones if you remove the pads because it's harder to see the you-know-what outlines. I also got a beige one that has a very messy seam. For that I am deducting one star. Although, both do fit me perfectly. I wear 36C bras and weigh 115 lbs."
4.0,Considering we will be in this pandemic for a while this mask would be more useful during the winter months. Its super cute and I get compliments on it all the time but it is quite thick.
4.0,"i wear these a lot, just very long. I think i got an XL and im 5'8"
4.0,"Nice quality shoe, has arch  insert not integrated into sole.  Returned because had no heel, true ""slip on"" like women's house slipper.  But you may like that..."
4.0,"Great poncho, the only draw back was the annoying hat bill that sticks out on the hood.  I guess it would be handy to have a certain circumstances but it wasn't with mine."
4.0,Fits my Citizen nicely. It is still a bit stiff even after a few months of wear. Other than that it's a great band.
4.0,Great quality but the neck area was a bit snug that I couldn't even get my head through it.
4.0,"I purchased this for my 10-year-old to take to outdoor summer camps, and it fits perfectly - I do think the hat runs a little small for adults, though - I don't think it fits comfortably on my head.  The ponytail hole in the back is nice, the chin strap is easy to use, and it's well-vented.  I didn't find the side snaps very easy to use, but it's been fine for us as my kid doesn't want the brim snapped up.  It also rolls up for fairly compact storage, though I wish there was a closure or tie of some sort included to keep it wrapped up.  All in all, exactly what we needed for camp and the kid likes the color."
4.0,"This skirt is awesome - it has a straight flattering and modern fit, cute pockets in the front. IT RUNS SUPER SMALL - I normally wear a size 6 and had to get a LARGE.  I wish it were a little thicker, but for the price this is a great skirt and will go great over yoga clothes, tights, for travel, etc..."
4.0,"These work just fine.<br />No skin reactions.  They are not too small, not too long.<br />The tips are colorful and interchangeable."
4.0,This handbag is to beautiful and not having a proper name tag  minus one star for thé tag  great service thank you
4.0,"The dress is very nice for the price, but the slip under the dress is small.  Dress fit great, but slip doesn't."
4.0,"unfortunately the left glove has a defect. I will be sending them back for another pair. It was an xmas gift, he likes them but saw the defect. wanted to get a pair in brown as well. what does that tell you?"
4.0,"I’ve bern using this purse about a month now.  Not much in it, my wallet, a comb, lipstick.  But it already broke.  :/. However, the company refunded me my money. :)."
4.0,These were very cute. Wore them for St Patty's day festivities.  Good price for what you get.
4.0,"I like the look, but was hoping it was a bit thicker for warmth"
4.0,I ordered my regular size but found the toebox to be too confining. I fixed the problem with a pair of kitchen shears which were used to cut off the front few inches of the uppers. It worked fine and they are now the most comfortable pair of slippers that I have ever owned.
4.0,"Pretty case, looks as pictured. Covering is made out of fabric. Must note that the hinges on my case were a little off so one side kind of dips over the other side when the case is closed or when a lot of pressure is applied to the case. This didn’t really affect my glasses too much but if you’re particular about this kind of thing then it might bother you."
4.0,"Good fit.  I am 5'6 and weigh 230lbs so I went with a XXL.  Vibrant color, which I like given that, for some reason, most guests opt for dark colors at a wedding.  I will need to take it to the dry cleaner if I want the dress to see another day, though."
4.0,Accurate photo. Fits nicely but noticing the band might wear out quickly... Besides that I really like this product!
4.0,"Soft and comfortable. It is a bit sheer, so you may need to wear a layer under."
4.0,Arrived with an expected time good quality Material
4.0,"The shape of the shirt is a little more flared at the bottom than I was hoping for. It is a cute shirt but not as flowy as I was expecting. Cotton fabric is much stiffer than appears in photos on here. I will still keep this though, I do like the little pocket detail."
4.0,"Very cute and appeared to be of great quality, just fits a bit larger than I expected. The fur makes the boot stay on though even though it was a bit large for my daughter."
4.0,So cute!  Thought they would be bigger though.
4.0,Very petite but cute
4.0,Smelled great and my partner seemed to notice.
4.0,"The brown is closer to an army green, but nice and still useable"
4.0,"The shirts fit great! I was excited to have them in three different colors, but the package came with two gray shirts and a maroon shirt, rather than the black, gray and maroon combination. Disappointed to not get the black color, but I will use the shirts as they fit well and feel great."
4.0,Beautiful dainty earrings but one screw didn’t properly screw but amazon fixed the issue and made it right
4.0,"They aren't as comfy as I expect Corkys to be, but that's my only complaint. They fit really well on my average size 7 feet. They look pretty hawt, and I love the straps, both the look of them, and how they are more supportive than most wedges."
4.0,"I like it, I just wish it was purple on both sides of the ribbon."
4.0,"Beautiful dress. The top is too big but will have it altered. I love the way it looks on me. I'm, 5'3&#34; 160 ordered a large but could have used a medium."
4.0,These are very pretty earrings I had planned to keep in my earlobes on a permanent basis.  They are very difficult to insert in your earlobes and almost impossible to close.  They keep falling out of my ears when I'm sleeping.  I think I would not buy these again.
4.0,"Loooooove the theme and the selection, but wish there was a way to customize the order for multiple of certain styles."
4.0,This belt is a super cute addition to my belt collection. The price is great as the belt appears to be very well made. I've worn this elastic band belt a couple of times now and continue to get compliments. The only reason I deducted a star is because the bow is slightly bigger than I wanted. I would definitely recommend this to a friend.
4.0,I’m looking for a dress for the nutcracker in December- This one will work great<br />I love the dress it’s beautiful 😍 only thing it’s a medium and it’s long not at knees that<br />Part is ok but it’s also large at the lower part the upper part is little tight if I got a small the upper part would not have fit in the upper part -<br />All over I’m keeping it
4.0,It was a little thinner than I thought.
4.0,Cutests little bag it’s perfect to pack my kids and I and go to the zoo or amusement park. Only dislike is that the straps don’t stay in place at a longer length unless u knot it but that’s not a deal breaker!
4.0,These were a gift to my mother and she loves them.
4.0,Little long for 5'4&#34; person.
4.0,classy dress a large fits like a size 6 and that was awhat i wanted i made it shorter and took out the hip bumps on the inside
4.0,I love the dress but I sure wish it was longer.
4.0,it is a good bathing suit if you have a stomach to cover up
4.0,"My wife likes the looks of these socks and overall they are very comfortable, but these socks are just a tad too tall for her 5’ 1” frame. Thus, she either needs to fold over the top or let the socks slip down a bit where doubled-up material is at the ankle. Either way is not preferable yet the socks were comfortable."
4.0,Everything worked and no leaks.
4.0,gets dirty but nice band
4.0,"Good! But doesn’t last for long, great for occasional dress wear not for every day wear"
4.0,really liked it.
4.0,Great hoodie. My kid loved it.
4.0,"Fit great,and the coton is perfect."
4.0,Bought as a gift. She likes it
4.0,somewhat small in the bust area
4.0,"Cute shirt. Material is nice and breathable. The only drawback I found is that, the pocket placement is a little weird if you have large breasts. Otherwise, a great deal!"
4.0,"I’m 5’2” and weigh 147, the medium of the shorter inseam pair fits great and is comfy and flattering."
4.0,Pretty top didn't like the material
4.0,"They’re cute but too long, will have them hemmed."
4.0,I've tried some other masks that were too tight. They'd eventually fall off. This is big enough for my fat head.
4.0,Nice style but too light weight. The material feels like paper felt. OK for a couple of uses.
4.0,Love the colors and designs but they run a little small
4.0,Love this style of cardigan. I gave 4 stars because the color was not the one as pictured. I still kept the cardigan because I love the style and the fabric is so soft.
4.0,My wife tried it on and was pleased with the way that it fit.
4.0,Less than for the money but still love it
4.0,"They are comfortable to wear, still my 10.5 size foot only fit in them without socks. If they were any smaller they would go back"
4.0,"This bracelet came very nicely packaged, definitely appropriate for gift-giving.  It is a beautiful bracelet, but even with my small wrists (6"") I find it somewhat difficult to get on.  Once on it tends to settle on my wrist bones, but it is so pretty that I can deal with that."
4.0,"This dress is mostly great. Good length, modest neckline and gorgeous stitching detail. The material is heavy and not see-through at all. My only complaint is the stitching pattern is not soft on the inside at all so it rubs on my arms and is pretty irritating. It's not itchy, it scratches and almost hurts after a while. Other than that, it is a really cute, quality dress."
4.0,Item arrived quickly. Nice colors. Not as soft as I’d hoped.
4.0,Nice small scarf.  Print on both sides.  Lightweight silk.
4.0,"most scratch free protective packaging i've ever seen. work, light."
4.0,"Good value for the price but came bent up a bit, I was able to bend arms back into place. I wish it was just a tad taller but overall happy with the rack."
4.0,Cord around the horn comes off easily but still cute and warm.
4.0,"Ok quality but for being advertised as being for  weightlifters, this shirt runs small and short."
4.0,"I like the dress with two exceptions. I feel that the dress runs a little large and the material is on the heavier side. Besides that, it's a lovely, comfortable dress and accurate to the photo. Would recommend."
4.0,It was adorable and my sister wears it all the time. Solid buy.
4.0,"I have several. The handle will crack and wear, after a while.... you get what you pay for. I don't mind, at this price. Very roomy. Great size and shape, for me and my needs. I will DEFINITELY continue adding more colors, to my collection. Shipped VERY fast... arrived before estimate arrival date."
4.0,"bought these for a wreath so cant tell you about the fit, but they are adorbs!"
4.0,"Just received this dress and I'm quite happy with it. It fits well and the material is very soft. It is slightly sheer but I don't care if someone can sort of see my black bra so that's fine. Wear a nude bra if that doesn't work for you. For fitting references: I'm 5'6, 150lbs, and a 36DD. I went with a medium. The bust and shoulders are the only places that are fitted on me in this dress; everywhere else is loose and flowing and the hem hits about 3&#34; above my knees."
4.0,I'm 5'8 173lbs and I ordered a XL it fit great
4.0,We ordered a medium for our son that wears a small but it fits great.
4.0,Its beautiful wish it was real.
4.0,Super cute summer tops !  I ordered an xtra large in the white and red hearts and a large in the red w white flowers and the candy stripe top. I’m a 38 C 5’3”  the red hearts top comes together by tying both sides of the shirt in a knot in front so it is somewhat open (see pic) and will show your stomach esp if the wind catches it. The flower red top ties in back and the candy stripe ties in front but is more a decoration and not like the red heart shirt. The candy stripe shirt is adorable and they all have adjustable straps. Material is different on each top (candy stripe is like a linen feel and will shrink a bit in the wash) but each material is nice and soft against the skin.  All need iorning. Great for summer !!  Adorable. See pics
4.0,"I used it as a replacement watch band.  It is real leather embossed with alligator patterns.  It is of good quality and is strong and attractive.  It is perhaps not the thinnest band out there, but is good value for money."
4.0,I thought it would be bigger so I could use it at the grocery store.  But I love the design.  My dad will be thrilled and I'm sure he will find many uses for this.  It just will not hold a lot of stuff.
4.0,"They are beautiful and comfortable,  but their color isn't as uniform as the blue ones."
4.0,Nice folding reading glasses that are used when my script bifocals bite the dust.  The price is well worth the investment for anyone who needs help with the fine print.
4.0,"I gave it 4 stars because the blush color is very flattering with my complexion and the material is soft but not too thin. The fit is a little odd because of the dimensions. I saw reviews that said it ran big. It runs LONG but if you have a D cup or above, it might pull at the buttons. I bought this with a coupon and got a good price, so I'm going to hem the bottom a couple inches and add some stitches along the buttons so there's no gap. It's worth keeping because of how comfortable it is. I'm wearing it scrunched as I show in the pictures until I have time to shorten it."
4.0,"It's a bit smug, Consider sizing up a size or two."
4.0,I am really happy with it. It looks very nice and feels like high quality material. It looks amazing on a bronze watch!
4.0,Received this scarf very fast and it is great! I have already worn it with several outfits and love that it is something different but not outrageous.
4.0,"Love the fabric and style, but ran way too big. The yellow is gorgeous and just as pictured. I will reorder when smaller size is available."
4.0,It was ok. Cheap material though.
4.0,"SO SOFT! Beautiful color and arrived quickly!!! I WISH it worked for me! But I am returning because of how wide the shoulders are, I just don’t think it is flattering on me personally, it made my already wide shoulders look even bigger and boxier, I am thinking about sizing down and re ordering but I am worried it wouldn’t change the width of the shoulders straps by much just shrink the whole thing a little in general 😔😔😔"
4.0,Spring hinges work well. Lightweight.
4.0,Good fit and very comfortable.
4.0,"One of the Casio classics that started it all. A must have in a collection and very reasonably priced. Is it tough and awesome, not really. But I do like wearing occasionally when I’m feeling like a “throwback” day….heck yeah!"
4.0,Love the shirt but the large is alitte too snug
4.0,"Like the style of this skirt! Pretty thin material, slightly see thru though."
4.0,"The pants fit great and are very cute. However, they do snag easily, which is unfortunate."
4.0,Liked the suit but it was more open on the side and back plus it was too big .  I returned it with no problems.
4.0,"First of all the shipping was ridiculously fast. It was shipped the same day I ordered it and got here pretty fast. This thing is so pretty. I read reviews that it was large, but assumed some people had small wrists. I guess I fit that category. But it's summer time and sandal wear time so guess what - - - ANKLE bracelet!  YES!!! I've already applied clear nail polish to it to preserve it.Can't wait to sport it...on my ankle."
4.0,Beatutifull!!
4.0,"Could not find a simple kids coat in a khaki color that I liked. Didn’t want any characters or crazy colors. Then, I found this coat. It was a great price and exactly what I was looking for! However, it did take almost two weeks to arrive because it was shipped from China. So, you would want to order this early or if you’re not in a rush for it. It’s exactly as described. It’s true to size and I got my kid a size bigger to grow into. Love it."
4.0,Beautiful product but a little small.  Buy three sizes bigger and you are right on.
4.0,The right color and fabric just right
4.0,"Order the size you normally would ONLY if you want the fit to be skin tight.  These run a tad small, otherwise well made, sleeves are long enough I wish they had thumb holes but the stitching is hands down the best I've seen given the price, not worried about anything coming apart at the seams like I am with other moisture wicking tops that I paid more for.  Will be ordering more of these in future to replace said more expensive but falling apart previous purchases."
4.0,Nice shirtt.
4.0,"So I am certain not everyone is going to use this item the way that I use it.  I am a jouster and I need a new hat that would allow me to have better visibility.  Its a good helmet, I glued in some padding and it was good to go.  Well that is the rivets needed to be pounded down some cause they were protruding a bit and well cut my nose some when I got knocked off my horse."
4.0,The coat itself is somewhat large but I meant it to be like that so it’s fine. Although the hoodie strap seemed too small to wrap around the head.
4.0,"Delivered on time, fits nice, lightweight material. Wish it came in other colors"
4.0,"For more bolero feel, suggest getting a size down."
4.0,"These dress socks are very nice, and I received six pairs for about half off for an honest evaluation. I ordered the argyle and design and actually got 2 pairs of the navy socks and 4 pairs of the black socks. Additionally one pair of the navy has the argyle color order reversed. While neither my boyfriend (the actual tester) or I minded, it is something to note. As for fit, the foot has a good deal of stretch and fit a size 11 foot very well and comfortably. However, the tops require more stretch which they did not provide. It has about the amount of stretch needed for a women's calf, but not so much a man's. While my man does have rather large calves, most males do and the tightness of the top of the socks are uncomfortable when pulled up. I have yet to see how these hold up after a few wears and washes, and I will update if my opinion changes."
4.0,"The headpiece was kind of small, but it was cute."
4.0,"Exactly as advertised, super cute and fun for the fourth of July"
4.0,I loved them when I opened them but the sizes were all different and when I took it off at the end of the day my skin was green where ever the metal was. I also barely snagged one on something and it broke  Overall I think they are very cute however the durability is lacking.
4.0,I probably should have ordered a size up but she likes them n wants to keep them. Might have to order another. Fit fine and seem comfortable.
4.0,Bellbottoms are hard to buy for kids. My 5 y/o daughter is tall but slim so buying a 5/6 was too short for her but perfect for the waist. Too fit perfect though
4.0,"These were really awesome,until about a month or two in and started turning pink"
4.0,I like the size and sturdiness of these bags. The only thing I don’t like is that the zipper is sometimes tricky to zip and unzip
4.0,I really liked the quality and shape of these but they did hurt my ears after a while from hours of wear. They aren’t really heavy but I do have small ears so that could have been the issue lol
4.0,Good suit
4.0,"Sexy black dress.  At least I feel sexy in it, lol.  I definitely feel like it would look better if I lost weight, and had a smaller size with less flabby arms, but it worked for a special date night.  I’m 5’8” 207 lbs.  Size XL.  My husband thought it looked nice.  I paired it with a cheaper pair of chunky black heels also from Amazon.  I’m out of practice with heels, but they were easy to walk in and matched the dress nicely."
4.0,Great bag the size is perfect for EDC just not pleased with the comfort of the strap. It seems to be impossible to carry it so I can draw right handed.
4.0,"I don't spend a lot of money on sunglasses since I lose or break them often.  These glasses look good and are clear for vision.  The plastic is thin and seems fragile, but I gave them a 4 star since the price was so good.<br />The packaging was nice and it included a cloth bag for the glasses and small decal."
4.0,"Cute. This guy lettering would be better but, uou get what you pay for."
4.0,"They fit great. Some seemed a little thin, a couple pair were thicker and fit a little tight though. Those weren't very stretchy."
4.0,The Leo fits over all pretty good. I definitely would not have fit in the small so it's good I got a medium but it does seem a bit loose around my torso.
4.0,"It fits big so I am glad I ordered a size down. The red is darker than you would expect for Spiderman, which should be a bright red. I wish the inside of the good was black instead of white. The white looks a little strange with the black and red of the shirt. It isn't lined. Which I actually like. That way he won't get too hot. He is happy, so I'm going to keep it. I would send it back if it wasn't for my son insisting he wear it Halloween and there is no time to order anything else."
4.0,". . . Don't look, or feel too closely.  It is made of thin fabric, but will do the job of giving a different look to the tuxedo very nicely.  I currently only have bow ties and a reversible cumberbund, so the vest is a good change-up, plus it goes well with one of my wife's outfits."
4.0,Wets up for a cool head and quick dry characteristics also. Love the reflectors! Professional feathures.
4.0,I LOVE this suit but WAY TOO SMALL...ordered a Large and its def a SMALL...when ordering from overseas order 3 times your size.  Too expensive to ship back and cant find any one to buy it from me.  Dont know to many people that small. VERY Disappointed I lost $35 on this
4.0,"Ordered a small. Perfect for my 5'7, 135lbs self. Flowy. Not tight. Just have to get the collar to stay down."
4.0,"I love this hoodie, it’s so comfortable! The only bad thing is after a few washes the graphics are fading but I love how soft and comfy it is!"
4.0,This shirts fits great....even the high collar is not constricting. I like the detail of the collar...it adds a decorative touch and no additional jewelry is needed. You may need a cover up or to wear a camisole under as the arm holes are larger and you can see your bra from here....even if it's black...I don't like this. It's not as long as the picture shows...I have it to just below the waistline of my pants and I'm 5'6&#34;.<br />I received this at a discount for my unbiased review.
4.0,"Dolphins are my favorite mammal. I have all types of dolphin jewelry ranging from bracelets, earrings , and necklaces. My necklace arrived in a small white box, but you might get it in a pouch, according to the description. The dolphins are dainty, but not too small. The small jewel in between the tails is clear and vibrant.  The chain is decent, but I will more than likely replace it for a style I like much more (that's normal!) The chain is about 18 inches long, but I prefer longer.  You can purchase a chain extender at any stores such as Walmart or Target. I did buy this at a discount for my review. The original price is a bit too high, in my opinion, for the value."
4.0,"Still breaking in but good so far. They're mid ride boots and I knew the tongue would stick out and make my pants look retarded but they stick out a little farther that I expected. They feel like tennis shoes and are very comfortable! I usually wear a 13 and ordered a 13, and they fit well. As long as the laces and eyes last I will be happy. They are very sturdy for over pronation. They stand straight up and don't tip to the sides. They're still comfortable to walk in though."
4.0,Great service and everything I wanted out of it.
4.0,"I bought this jacket for cosplay purposes and wanted it to be a tighter fit so I bought the medium. I’m pretty tall (6’ 160lbs) and have a wider back because I’m athletic. If I was wearing this for everyday I would have bought a large but this will work for costume uses. It’s pretty tight with a lot less stretch than you would think. My only complaints about the size I bought, is the sleeves aren’t long enough, most likely due to how tight it is on my upper back. Has a great shape and I think it would be flattering on most body types. Just be aware, it has a very narrow fit. Oh, and it is ridiculously warm."
4.0,"I like these, but after a few hours of wear, for some reason my ears begin to ache.  I kept them, but don't wear them very often.  Cute though, and the post are small!  A huge plus for me!  Small posts on huggies are difficult to find."
4.0,"Very nice, fits my nieces well"
4.0,"Fit a bit big around waist however looks straight. Come to my knees (I'm 4' 11 3/8"")"
4.0,"I'm 5'9, it hit just above my ankles at the longest point.  I prefer my maxis to be floor grazing"
4.0,Pro: Wallet has a lot of room.<br />Con; it is very slick and hard to hang onto or to get out of the rear pocket.
4.0,"Bracelet was certainly smaller than I expected, however it was for a child so the size was actually perfect. The dandelion seed in the resin was a hit more on the yellow side of color, not as white as it looks in photos. Also the seed was not ""puffed"" out as nicely as advertised. The bracelet made a little girl very happy regardless of what I think of it, so i gave 4 stars. Shipping was super fast!"
4.0,"Bought this in L/XL for 6ft1, 220lb husband. Fits him with lots of room to spare. Thin, soft material but not too thin. I would recommend this for a guy who wants a lounging robe that's comfy and soft but not plush."
4.0,"Talla L. Medidas: peso 79 kg altura 172cm. Se siente demasiado apretado, subiría una talla más la próxima compra."
4.0,Very nice dress but runs on the bigger side. I'm 5&#34;4 and 125 lb and the small is baggy around the waist. Still like it though. Cute and comfy !
4.0,The watch itself is very pretty and came in a nice box but the one I received had already been started. The plastic between the start button had been removed. Makes me wonder if I got an used product!?
4.0,"Gorgeous colors, pretty good print quality. I love the shirt so much. ordered an extra large and it's a little baggy on me but it fits really comfortably. It's kind of a thin shirt, not a thicker t-shirt."
4.0,As a ftm i was looking for some good and affordable nursing bras. These bras are great nursing bras. They are soft and comfortable. I always like the padded bras so i love the idea of removable pad in these bras. The quality of the product is superb.I just love these bras. Bra extenders is a good addition. A must have for nursing moms. Highly recommended.<br />The only reason of giving 4 star is they are somewhat small to size and the color is white instead of pink in 3 pack of bras. Also i didn't wash them so don't know how they will turn out after washing.<br /><br />Updated version : After many washes they are still in good condition. The color doesn't fade either. Thumps up for these bras.
4.0,"Lo pedí para regalo, a mi  hermana le encantó"
4.0,Just what I expected (not expensive) and what I wanted.
4.0,The bra is cute and looks as though it would keep things in place. Runs small so size up.
4.0,Very pretty set! I really like it and have received a lot of compliments.
4.0,"I bought this for my Charlie Chaplin costume this year. Almost every review of this hat talks about it being a little too small. If you are buying this hat to be worn &#34;correctly&#34; like folks back in the 20's, it will be too small. If you want to have a simply rest on top of your head and purposefully knock it off with your bamboo cane while you stumble about with your big clown shoes, like the little tramp, then this hat is for you!! In other words, it's perfect for a Chaplin costume!! It's supposed to be a little too small for that particular look! Hope this helps!"
4.0,I love the material! I'm 5'5 and 165lbs -i bought an XL. The waist fit was perfect but I did have the bottom hemed up 3 inches because it hit mid-shin for me and I decided I wanted knee length.
4.0,"looks cute but also looks very cheap. you get what you Pay for, but the seams are very obvious. one of those &#34;it gets better with distance&#34; outfits. but will be just fine for a quick decent work outfit now and again."
4.0,Purchased as a gift. She loves them.
4.0,Loved the triangles. Flourishes spun around on my ears.
4.0,Bought for my mom who wanted London Fog but was extremely happy with Tommy Hilfiger.
4.0,"I'm sure this mask would be great for masquerades and such, but for my particular use it turned out to be too large (and this is surprising since I'm a large man myself).  I returned the product not because it was defective, but because it was too big and didn't fit the part of the costume I'm building.  The quality of the product is very good and it didn't feel uncomfortable."
4.0,It fits and looks fantastic but can be tricky getting on and staying on.  But it is sooo cool and looks dragontastic!
4.0,I got these but found out that I'm allergic to wool so I passed them off to my niece who I see wearing them all the time. She says they are wonderful and warm and fit nicely. What more could you ask for? (And we both agree that they are cute too).
4.0,Very cute & fit well yet ver affordable!
4.0,"I wish it had two pockets, one for my cell phone and one for my camera, but it is still great and holds all essential items that I need. to carry."
4.0,its a mesh bag so?
4.0,They fit well and are very fashionable.
4.0,The material is nice but seemed alittle large. I wear a true medium and they were loose. They fit comfortable and keep you cool and dry under a uniform
4.0,Not good for 5 yrs. old - they will break easily
4.0,"These shorts really help for long bike rides. Very comfy and the legs do not ride up. I usually wear medium and ordered a medium, which fit just fine.  Great product"
4.0,Super comfortable pants.  I even have the fleece lined pants as well.  The only issue is that the zippers easily twist and get stuck.  Otherwise 5 stars.0
4.0,"It’s a really nice dress, but a little small in the top.  It was perfect in the bottom."
4.0,these were good first shoes for my grandson. He is taking his first steps so the lightweight design makes them perfect. very easy to put on a wriggly baby. And I also got them at a great discount.
4.0,"Very attractive, multi-strand necklace.  Has the appearance of real tourquoise. Good quality clasp and attractive length for a variety of necklines."
4.0,"I am 6' so would have preferred a little more length, but overall nice casual dress for the price."
4.0,These are good for the price. I only wish the brown and purple were a little darker.
4.0,I have ordered many charms on Amazon. These just came in the pack. There super cheap and lightweight. Some r even deformed. Everything else about this pack is great
4.0,"Bought these once before from this same listing a few years ago and didnt have a problem. Ended up losing them all and ordered again. This time around they are screwed together so tight that I have to use pliers to get them apart, which is super annoying! After getting them apart the first time with pliers though they are fine, no issues."
4.0,Love this purse. I would just like it if it was slightly bigger.
4.0,I like this. It has a great look to it. Of course you cant wear it everyday because it will most likely fade but it's great for pics or a night out. I would get another one.  UPDATE faded rather quickly.
4.0,"I am prone to losing sunglasses. When I found these I figured that I would give them a try. They are wonderfully dark, which is helpful during the winter months with all the snow. There are a few minor imperfections with some of the lenses, but you do get what you pay for."
4.0,"Loved the presentation and quality of this product,<br />it arrived fast, in a nice case, the product was good value for money and seemed sturdy,<br />unfortunately had to return because it was too big for my facial features but had no problem getting a refund,<br />so recommended!"
4.0,"My daughter has become obsessed with all things Japanese, so she wanted to add these clogs to her collection.  You can't walk very far or for very long in these...it's very awkward.  But they are cute for completing a Japanese outfit (kimono, etc.)."
4.0,Looks more pink than red but I still like it very much.
4.0,"I love this &#34;sweater,&#34; fits a little snug but I really like it. I wear an xl but I read some reviews and ordered an xxl, so it fits as I expected. I will order again, love the colors available."
4.0,"Cute, but the lace on the edges is rough and itchy. I just cut mine off . Great price, worth it to buy."
4.0,I love my mask. But my package only came with 1.
4.0,A bit tight on shoulders but cute and would probably have ordered a size larger to be just a hair longer for when the wind blew dres open
4.0,"I don't often write reviews, but this one I'll make a little exception.<br /><br />The mask itself fits well, but I have four problems with it that I've needed to make adjustments to fix:<br />1. The nose.  Dear God the nose.  I've put packing foam on the nose with fabric glue and now it no longer crushes my nose.<br />2. Can you hear me now?  I've had to drill holes where the mouth is, in order for people to actually hear me.  Using a very small drill bit did the trick and keeps the holes mostly concealed.<br />3. What did you say?  I can't hear a darn thing wearing this mask.  Drilling more small holes into the ears fixed that.<br />4. The straps don't really hold on well.  I've used some velcro straps to correct this, so the velcro latches on instead of relying on the strap loops."
4.0,"I bought these in large size.  I have a beard, and it was recommended in a review that if you have a beard you purchase large size so you don't squish your beard.  I find the large size too big, it just doesn't fit me well (200lb man).<br /><br />That being said, these masks look good, are stiched well, etc.  I think I would be more satisfied if I would have purchased the correct size.<br /><br />I notice that the strap in back seems to go below the skull, which is common.  I find a better fit with straps which are meant to go to the crown of your head (like where a bald spot would be)."
4.0,"This was one of those silly purchases, when my husband saw it, he had to have it!  He wore to out in Glamis ( out riding the sand dunes in his sandrail) IT WAS A HUGE IT, everyone stopped and asked him where he got it. Everyone seem to want one. LOL, it is less than sturdy quality, BUT, if you look at it, it looks like it's just kind of a silly fun item. It held up and will be worn again on his next trip. Very happy with fun and goofy purchase 🤪"
4.0,"The metal band on this watch only has a select number of segments that can be removed by bumping out the pins. I probably spent 45 minutes removing all possible segments only to realize that it doesn't fit my wrist even after removal.<br /><br />People with short wrists, be ready to look into different watch bands, as this one runs very large.<br /><br />Bright and glorious watch otherwise.  Well priced."
4.0,I like the dress but it was a little loose and am afraid that the small size may be too tight
4.0,Bought this as a Mother’s Day gift.  Very pretty.  Decent price.
4.0,"The gemstone itself is great, the only reason I can’t give it 5 stars is the chain. The clasp is to big for any of the links including the one that it is supposed to link to"
4.0,The small is a little too big. I am 5'1 and 130 pounds and it draped very large on me.
4.0,Love this baggy jumpsuit but due a size up... Comfortable fit!!!!
4.0,shipped in 2 days came in 1! i like the length and i like the look. Came in a cool little jewelry box. good buy!
4.0,"Like this dress, I wear it with capris leggings, as dress is shorter than expected."
4.0,the bennie is great but the mustache part could be beter
4.0,More blueish/purple than green but I love it!
4.0,"These are nice warm and plush. My main gripe is that they're both the same. It is NOT a his and her's set. It's just two. No distinguishing marks so you don't get them confused and no size differential for a man or woman. Mine doesn't fit me. I'm about 6'4"" the sleeves are too short and the whole thing is a little short as well. My wife's looks huge (in a good warm and cozy way) on her 5' frame."
4.0,"I had ordered this before in a black XL. It seemed to look nice with long pearls & boots, so I ordered 2 more colors. When I tried on the mauve, it was definitely too big! The waist hung down to my hips & even a belt didn’t bring it in enough! I have reordered, red in medium & mauve in large, as the XL, my usual size, was so big! I really hope the red, medium, fits well, because I want to wear it for Valentine’s Day to dinner. I also ordered the wine red in Large. Red in L not available until late Feb. so hoping the M fits! If not, I’ll have the red-wine in L & can wear that. I have a tutu, type slip to fill out the skirt & hope it has flattened out some with washing. Before that, it was way, too full! I’m going to try & shrink the XL’s that I ordered before to a smaller size in a hot dryer & hope that works! Basically nice looking. Probably better on those with a full-figure, like I used to have😉 It does need : a belt & long necklace to fill in the plain, high-necked top. Boots will also help it to look better. Maybe black boots with black leggings or tights. The XL was also quite low under my knees & not flattering at all. Hopefully a good length in the M & L & not too long! Looking for my bubble heart necklace (Jessica Simpson) that I couldn’t find today! I think it will look super-cute on the large blank chest!"
4.0,My son love’s Mickey. He wears the shirt with happiness. Size was good and quality for the money.
4.0,"Wonderful pattern and quality. Pants are long, had to hem 3 inches."
4.0,Good bargain; looks good
4.0,"Did I read the description wrong? I thought this was cotton, but it is a silky, drapey fabric. I love the style, the color, and the fit is perfect. This a lighter weight fabric suitable for in between seasons."
4.0,"Es super cómodo y tiene diseños muy bonitos aunque si viene un poco grande, se debe tener en cuenta para las mujeres de cuello delgado"
4.0,I don't think its the best looking bag around but it dose the job. It is small enough to fit under the seat on a plain but I was able to fit a surprisingly lot of stuff into such a little bag. It's a great  for the times you don't need to check a bag.
4.0,"This is one of those hats you only can wear (as a guy) when it is very cold outside.  And it works great.  I would say use this with a wool skull cap for extra warmth in very cold weather.  It fits nicely, the artificial fur feels very real to me.  The cotton and polyester fabrics combined make this very warm. I really like the snap button ear flaps, as you can unbutton the flaps and put even warmer ear covers on if needed. I really did do this and it works!  The look of fake fur surrounding the face is fun and makes a person (like me!) look like I just got back from fishing in Siberia.  Russian roots help that look!  The adjustable chin strap makes the hat really fit almost any average sized head. I wear a 7 1/4 and it fits me just right."
4.0,fabric is a little stiff but also seems durable.  Generally what I expected
4.0,"This is a beautiful luggage tag, and of great quality - but the strap (also made of leather) is pretty clunky, and doesn't lay flat when you tie it on the suitcase."
4.0,"Fits great, doesnt ride with movement. Color is very pink compared to picture though"
4.0,Good cult favorite but accuracy is a little slow.
4.0,I just got it yesterday. Arrived within a week of order. I like it. Only problem is there is this funky smell inside. I hoping it will go away with time.
4.0,Really nice sunglasses for the price.
4.0,"Given as a gift to teen girl. She wears it frequently.. Would have liked to have a choice on the length of the chain either a 16&#34; or 18&#34;, a 16&#34; would have fit her better."
4.0,My butt cheeks sweat so much but I looked hot. They were happy rear tears
4.0,"I love the look of the dress. Unfortunately, it was too big and they don't have a size smaller. I had to return it."
4.0,"Nice quality, but runs small. My husband typically wears a Large, but even the XL is a bit tight in the arms."
4.0,"I was conflicted in choosing how many stars to give these. On one hand they're so dang cute. On the other hand they smelled bad (like chemicals) when I opened the box and they have a lot of &#34;stuff&#34; going on inside that makes them not go on and sit on as well. Like... extra fabric inside at the seems.. which isn't abnormal for some clothes to have but when it comes to leg warmers I want a smooth inside. As smooth as the outside. It's just comfier that way.<br /><br />But, they fit well. They're longer than another brand of leg warmers I usually buy. I prefer longer since my baby is above average in height and has longer limbs. Not a lot longer, mind you. Maybe an inch. But that's a lot with leg warmers.<br />I like that they're not super thick and too warm so you can still use them in warmer months if you want. But they're just warm enough that in cooler weather they'd add protection against the cold.<br /><br />All in all if the other brand I love made a sports design leg warmer I would have chose that brand in a heartbeat. But as it is, this is the only brand that makes sports themed leg warmers at an afforadable price! And I don't regret buying them. I'd rebuy them :)"
4.0,"I wore these for 2 weeks on vacation in Florida and never worried.  They go with every occasion, are very pretty, and very sturdy.  If I could just find the exact pair in a little bit bigger size!"
4.0,"Color was a little off but fit is great, beautiful & very comfortable."
4.0,"I was a little skeptical at first reading the other reviews but I was pleasantly surprised with this elf costume. It's a little wide but the belt makes it super cute and it's actually really comfortable for a costume. The stockings for the legs are way too tight and don't fit well but I just ordered a pair of striped stockings and it looks perfect. Would give a five-star review but since the stockings were too small, that's why I knocked it to a four. Overall really happy with this elf costume."
4.0,Does what they’re suppose to do. Only downside on this product is the material.
4.0,Really love this dress.  Does run small.  I wear a size 6/7 and a size 10 is tight in the ribs still Ships fast though and so did replacement. Had to repay to ship and shipping wasn't reimbersered with first one. Will post pic when actually wear in few weeks...
4.0,i dont know if i got used ones or what but i got them and the acrylic was super scratched... i used em anyways though and they are great for the price. also got here super quickly.
4.0,Runs small. . .otherwise great jacket.
4.0,This was a Christmas present and my daughter really liked it.
4.0,"I think its so pretty and for big girls too. Im 5'2 180lbs, average waist but big thighs and a but. And it fit nicley on me. the arms are alittle snug but not uncomfortable."
4.0,"Good for the price, $12.99. Beanie is warm and seems decent quality. Speakers work fine. Biggest complaint is that the speakers start saying ""Please charging"" over and over again as soon as the battery gets down to 10%. Kind of a mood killer when that interrupts the music, and makes the last 10% of battery life not worth using. Just let me drain my battery in peace, thanks."
4.0,"About what I expected, I have a fat head and it fits."
4.0,"I bought these simple because I need some shades because my other pair got lost.I want the &quot;darkest&quot; lenses I could get my eyes are very sensitive to the sunlight. The glasses fit securely, for the money they're great."
4.0,SOOOO CUTE MY IPHONE XS FITS GOOD INSIDE
4.0,I can at least wear a few of these.
4.0,"Great to display, fine artwork.<br />In my Egyptian collection"
4.0,"Beautiful, comfortable, swift arrival only real downer is it's not as warm as the post title suggest. Overall good product. Would work just fine for average winter days but single digits or below not so much."
4.0,Looked fine in the St. Patrick's Day Parade.
4.0,"These Glasses are fine for laying on your back while reading or watching TV.... HOWEVER, they are kind of heavy, so it's difficult to sit up and keep them on comfortably or easily for a long period of time. They are NOT high tech and have NOTHING to do with MRI's. They DO NOT protect you from radiation. How ridiculous. They are literally for laying on your back and reading."
4.0,Still kicking but pieces are breaking off.  Great feel but guessing I’ll have to replace soon as it starts looking more and more shady with missing pieces.
4.0,Work great for 20’s party. Did not look cheap!
4.0,"Colors are vibrant, metal is sturdy. I feel the photo is not an accurate dipiction of the color of the stainless steel. It is darker in person."
4.0,Daughter wore them with halloween costume
4.0,"Perfect fits great, very adjustable, descent quality for the price. However, cannot be excessively worn. If you're interested in corset training this is not the product. It's a good tester but not quality for full thread corset wearer."
4.0,"I love the material and the quality, but it doesnt fit the best... I am 5'7"" (170cm) and 125lbs. I ordered a size 4 because i generally wear small.<br />2 main callouts are that the sleeves are a bit short for a coat, and that the hood doesnt fit well. The back of the hood is very tight, but the front is loose above my head. I wish the front curved down more."
4.0,"From the picture it looks like a longer type crop top.. but it is a bit shorter than I thought. Other than that, I love this! It’s thin, but I expected that. It’s perfect for a cooler spring/fall day and not too heavy. I’ve been wanting this for awhile and I’m so glad I finally bought it!"
4.0,"Bought these as part of a teacher, end of the year gift so I won’t be able to speak to durability or weight, comfort, etc...Fabric looks durable, bag is well constructed, prints look true to picture. They arrived all wrapped up in their own elastic loops to keep them folded, would prefer a pocket but that’s only my preference. Would have also liked instructions on how to care for them and fold them back up for storage but both are things I can figure out."
4.0,"Shiny and light set of earrings, perfect size. Only lacking thing was back earring stoppers! I will wear them on my Zumba class, so I better go to find some stoppers!<br />Thanks for the fast shipping!"
4.0,"Everyone is correct that the longest pads do not go the full length or width of your foot. However, that was good for my purpose. I had very strappy shoes and these hide nicely while making them much more comfortable. They make my 3"" heels more comfortable than my 2"" heels."
4.0,"Great product! Durable and cheap! I’d say they run about a half size too big, but we made them Work!"
4.0,A great gift for men 👍
4.0,Trendy long leopard print necklace. Decent quality. People complement me when I wear it. Cute. Feels like fur. Good movement.
4.0,"The fabric was not what I expected, I should have read the information closer. I wasn't sure how I felt about this dress until I found out it had pockets. I love pockets. I ordered a small and it fit well. I am 5'6"" and the bottom just hit the floor so it was a great length. It was not very warm though and I wore nude spanx and a nude colored tank underneath it so it wasn't too see through. I'm sure if you bought a color other than white, it wouldn't be as sheer. I wore it to my bridal shower and got lots of compliments."
4.0,"Mine was a little small for a large, but a great design and makes you feel like a million bucks."
4.0,"i think i have pretty average sized wrists but i'm on the 5th hole from the end. color and fabric are nice, though."
4.0,LIKE  THIS  RED SET
4.0,Very pretty & delicate.
4.0,Covers well. Straps are pretty narrow. Not much lift but very comfortable.
4.0,This is a cute dress. I like the shape. It is sweet and flattering. The fit was pretty good. It was relatively comfortable. It was a good size for me.<br /><br />The material was okay and that was why I took off a star. It was light. It is a good dress to just throw on. It is a pretty flattering shape and is good at hiding problem areas. It was a good length on me.
4.0,"The skirt is cute, however the material is a definitely cheap and thinner than what I was hoping for. The elastic waist band is not super stretchy so I have trouble getting it over my bottom, but once on it fits well. Overall you get what you pay for and it is cute, just not high quality."
4.0,"I love these. great fat pants. a little long, they drag the floor on me, I guess I have short legs or something. Low waisted, they give me plumbers butt"
4.0,Pros: theyre funny and all of his friends wanted a pair.<br /><br />Cons: still broke up with me<br /><br />Pro: he still wears them and has to think of me every time he does muahaha
4.0,"Chances are, they are. My frames (both sort-of wider but not ridiculously so) fit very snugly in the cases. I am worried that eventually, it will cause the frames or the glass to crack... I may just be paranoid. The quality of the cases themselves is great, though! Sturdy, sharp, they look just like I thought they would... they just didn't really fit my glasses (sun or regular)."
4.0,"Took a while to get here, but looks great. Strong odor until washing."
4.0,"Very warm.  Runs small, I wear xl pants bought a 2xl and can't snap the top.  Tight on hips and thighs."
4.0,It is a very form fitting dress so if you have rolls and curves you’re uncomfortable with expect them to show!
4.0,"It's a big roomy t-shirt and I love it. It's very comfy, but it is in no way as sexy as it appears in the photo."
4.0,"The earring is a bit smaller than I expected. Having the earring next to something like a coin, or worn on an ear would be fine. Also, this is not just a men's earring, it's an earring. No need to tell people that it is for men or women. I looked for months for earrings like this and finally stumbled across the men's earrings in the exact cool shapes and sizes and colors I was looking for. BTW, no I do not wear men's clothes on the regular, and I am very feminine."
4.0,Excellent very comfortable shirt. Order one size bigger though and it'll be even more comfortable.
4.0,"These are super cute and love the fit! It's such a casual look that can be worn with any outfit. The lenses are a bit lighter than I was hoping for, but you get what you paid for. All in all, I like these sunglasses and recommend it for anyone who needs a cheap pair of sunglasses that is still fashionable."
4.0,The bracelet was beautiful. Its a little hard to put on yourself so you will probably need some help. I loved how fast it arrived too. I highly recommend this bracelet for anyone who loves the anchor them.
4.0,So comfortable and warm!
4.0,Fun and flowy. Longer in the back to hide your butt
4.0,"I took this dress on vacation in Arizona and it was perfect for the warm nights out, but it is very thin fabric, so if you get a light color expect it to be see-through. Provides a cover for your body, but zero warmth at all! The fit was flowy and very pretty, and I loved that it has pockets!!"
4.0,Very nice quailty.
4.0,The top is nice but it’s shorter than I was hoping for. The width is good. Would fit a petite height person well. I  5’3 but mostly torso so needed a little more length than petite. Large width is true to size just not length. Color matches photo.
4.0,Great buy.. we love them.  We purchased in a larger size hoping to have room to grow however they came in very snug. I suggest going to next size to ensure they will fit. Other than being on the snug size so far they work great and get lots of compliments
4.0,Very good quality. I bought a size 10 but it was too tight for a 36D. Too long for a 5'7&#34; girl.
4.0,This dress is so cute. Unfortunately my husband dried it and it doesnt fit anymore :( DO NOT DRY!!!!!
4.0,Great suit for the price!!  Only thing to make it better would be some support in the back.  Super cute and classy!
4.0,Draw string holes but no drawstring. They said it is made that way on purpose. It could also use a rubberized strip inside he waistband to help the shirt/rash guard stay tucked.
4.0,Nice jacket and perfect fit
4.0,The feel of the shirt is very nice and it's a very comfortable fit :) I might buy it again but in black!!!
4.0,"Good looking 2-tone ring. Can be worn with gold, silver or stainless steel watches and chains. Good value."
4.0,let ya know
4.0,My son in law loved the shirts!
4.0,"Broke within the first week...have had to repeatedly repair it since.  Is truly beautiful, but the quality of the chain is poor."
4.0,Would highly recommend this tank top super comfortable and light! Will order in more colors!
4.0,My 5 y/o needed warm non slip house shoes that she could also wear on covered patio or in garage. These fit nicely have a non skid sole. We have hardwood floors and with just socks she slides around when she is playing. These hold on well so she can run a bit without them falling off.
4.0,I generally wear a 1x and bought the 2x.  It fits and looks nice but was still smaller than I expected.  Lovely shape and nice product though.
4.0,Pretty pearl earring.  these are a gift.  Pretty enough to keep them so I hope she really likes them.
4.0,"These shoes are very comfortable once you wear them for a day or so. I wear a 10 in women's shoes. The length was perfect but the body of the shoe was slightly large. I can wear them with socks very well. Without socks, they are too wide and slip on my feet. I was hoping for a shoe that can be worn without socks since the weather here is mostly warm. Guessing these will be my winter/cold weather shoes."
4.0,"Well, where do I start. First, my Bluey obsessed 4 year old Grand son LOVES it!! the top fits like a 3T. he is small for his age, so it is ok. The pants, ok, here I go..... Are they shorts or pants??? They are huge and too short for pants and too long for shorts. I would not let him be seen in public in the bottom part of the outfit. The top, yes. Would I buy it again? Yes, but I would size up and throw away the pants. Bluey clothes are hard to find. It was worth the smiles and hugs I received from him and the laughs I had with my Daughter."
4.0,A little on the light on the weight but nice belt. If you like the look buy it
4.0,"I like this piece. The material is Soft, flowy and cool. It’s well made and stylish. Has 2 long slits in front of its leg. The color is vibrant like the picture. It’s true to its size. A few strokes of iron and it’s good to go. It bleeds a bit when washed. This is long for a shorty 5’ like me so I had to cut a bit. I’ve attached some pictures so others can see and assess it."
4.0,4 ladies loved cozy slippers!
4.0,I expected them to be a little longer but they work.
4.0,Fits a tad big because my daughter is a skinny lil thing but she looks beautiful in it! It's not a dainty little pj - very nice : )
4.0,Would love this shirt except it is sized way too big.
4.0,Just the right size. The extra strap for stability is nice as well.
4.0,it's a great dress for a wedding or funeral it made  little flimsy but i looked  like a million bucks a my sister funerals got lots of compliment
4.0,Liked the fact that I can wear this casually or dress it up.
4.0,"I got the largest size of these clogs, which are essentially just a Croc but off brand, in the biggest size and my daughter fit in them perfectly. I was hoping they would be a little bigger for her so that she can grow into them but it seems like they're perfect size so I would say they're a little bit on the smaller side. They're made out of a super lightweight material and have holes in them so they're a great shoe for those hot summer days working in the garden. My daughter is 6 years old and absolutely in love with pink and she loved these clogs the second she saw them, the little butterfly attachment on the top of a very cute addition as well. She loves the fact that she can put these on all by herself and that she can even wear them around the house kind of his flip-flops if she wanted. Being 6 years old she can't stand the flip flops that go in between your toes so these are a great substitution for that oh, I can see these being used so much from the river, to the beach to just outside in the yard, these are going to be worn out by the end of the summer."
4.0,"I ordered this dress a size up based on the reviews that said it ran a bit tight in the arms. The dress fits great and the material is much better than I expected! It's thick and not see through at all, kept me warm on the windy 4th of July night. My only complaint would be that when standing, the dress isn't long enough, (I'm 6') sitting however, the dress is definitely covers me. Would order again."
4.0,Soft texture. I expected it to be a little firmer. overall nice I really appreciate the color so it's hard to lose.
4.0,"Snug, but adorable. Thin material but can't see through. Wish it had a liner."
4.0,"The dress bust is made of 8"" with stretchy seams to hold itself in place.  It feels properly snug as there are no shoulder straps. The dress is long 44"" and the material is slightly too heavy to hold the ruffle at the bottom. The fact that the dress is long, for a  person 5'4"" tall. The impression I have is due to the lack of shoulder straps and its weight going all the way to the ankles, the dress could be pulled by the feet and leave the person unexpectedly exposed.  Its craftsmanship is excellent with proper adjustment for the different kinds of seams required to give a well finished look.  The color combination is on the heavy side, but if you don't mind having white, black, red, green, yellow and brown all in the same pattern, than the whole style may be 2 thumbs up, for me is more 1 thumb up."
4.0,Pretty satisfied with this item. It's comfortable and does it's job.
4.0,"My daughter wanted to jazz up her Crocs so she can switch her shoes out for prom. The design was cute, but the chain broke the next day. Doesn't mean it won't last if you brought it."
4.0,Very cute nice for the price only one was broken and shipping or prior to shipping
4.0,I ordered an extra large and it fits a little loose than I would like to fit. I should've gotten Large. The dress is cute.
4.0,Bought this for my dad and he really likes how breathable they are. I would recommend to anybody looking for big guy shirts.
4.0,Looks good heavy not Cheapo Depot I'm happy with it
4.0,"Used once and never again. Not bad, just not for me."
4.0,"Love these rings. However, when I wear more than one they twist, turn, turn and don’t stay put. Which makes them look bad because the -v’s- don’t line up. It may be because they are slightly big on my fingers. I ordered a 6.5-7 because my fingers swell in the summer and I didn’t want them to be too tight. I wish I would have purchased the flat ones instead."
4.0,The shirt fits well and looks great. I’d definitely others. I dropped one star for the effort it takes to press the cuffs on the sleeves so the patterned side shows.
4.0,"Fits perfectly! Love the fabric and the zipper is very long, all the way up to my neck, very nice."
4.0,"Bra area is too large, I ordered a size 12, should of went with bust measurement instead of size, a little large in tummy area also, but covered problem areas, hoping with a smaller size, I will feel more confident with it"
4.0,Got this for my wife as an anniversary gift.  Didn't realize it didn't come with a chain.  They really need to clarify that.
4.0,"Liked the look and feel of this scarf - bought it for my mom who liked it. Decent for the price, haven't washed it yet but seems quite delicate. Shall update after some usage."
4.0,I Like
4.0,"Bought 2 for Christmas gifts. Both men said they wished the fleece lining was brown instead of white. They can't wear it hunting because of the bright white, but it's warm for hiking or wood cutting."
4.0,"I love this ring!! It's gorgeous and the center stone is a good size. It's a little wide for smaller fingers, but you can wear one to two rings at a time, but you will probably want to wear all three. I just have to reorder in a smaller size. Great ring!!!<br />Update: I still love the ring, it is beautiful, but I've only worn it two times and two stones came out. Had to take away one star!!"
4.0,Extremely soft. Sleeves run a little long.
4.0,"Great goggles! The suction on these is intense. I don’t necessarily recommend wearing a respirator at the same time as you’ll need to wear the goggles too high and that’s uncomfortable, but alone these work great!"
4.0,"This is made of a thin material with a slight satin feel, (could easily be snagged).  IT is a decent length, Im average size and 5'8 laying over the back of my neck with each side coming down, reaches just about high waist.  overall if careful with it, its a decent scarf, worth what you pay for it anyway.  The colors are true to picture."
4.0,"looks good, all the snap in's fit"
4.0,Great for cool Spring days. I love it because it is long an I can where it with leggings. Will definitely be ordering another.
4.0,Nice one and fitted me well
4.0,Pretty but looks almost like a choker
4.0,Cute when dry. Kind of scratchy when it rubs on my arms. Clingy when wet and floats up.
4.0,"Good quality, but runs large. Order one size down! I love the layer look, so this shirt is perfect.You can combine it with jeans or leggings, you can easily dress it up or down. Would buy again!"
4.0,Great for your money
4.0,"nice and lightweight, comfortable wide strap, zippers work really well, lots of pockets. pink color is fun for the summer"
4.0,Nice material and sewing but the waist is lower than pictured.
4.0,I LOVE the swimsuit. Top is a bit too large but bottoms are perfect. I felt incredibly sexy in this swimsuit!
4.0,these are very soft and very warm.  only gave a 4 star because they are big around the waist since they are basically a one size fits all.  i am 5' 6<br />&#34; 138 lbs.  would buy again though.
4.0,Kids will love them.
4.0,"Ordered by size chart. Its huge! Still works and is cute, but don't order bigger"
4.0,"Nice jacket, well made although the material is more thin that it looks in the picture."
4.0,"Looks awesome and love the size of the beads! A little snug on my wrist, I would say it runs on the small side, but super cute stacked with other bracelets!"
4.0,Keeps my husband warm. He was upset I didn’t get two sets. I will be buying more
4.0,Cute and fun to wear!
4.0,Great item. Really like.
4.0,The sizing is small but other aspects are expected.
4.0,"It’s pretty good quality, but fits a little weird on the head. Still looks very good on my boyfriend!"
4.0,"Received the tote bag just in time for Easter, perfect size.  The down side are the straps, to thin and fatigue."
4.0,"Love the pendant, but the bale was really small and I had trouble finding a necklace that it would fit on."
4.0,"really nice, Im wearing them out as a set. very stylish."
4.0,I like how it look. feel little cheap but still look good. i am satisfied for sure.
4.0,"I purchased this as a gift for our middle granddaughter, who enjoys gymnastics. My wife and I both think she will like it and having viewed the product, as well as its &#34;cardboard jewelry box&#34; container, we are pleased we purchased it. The only reservation I have, which is why I rated it four stars instead of five, is that it seems to be overpriced for the type of item it is.<br />I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for an honest review."
4.0,They look n feel nice
4.0,"Bought this backpack for my girlfriend. Feather weight, comfortable, lots of pockets, etc. to carry all sorts of stuff. Weight of what you are carrying is distributed nicely, so is very comfortable for long hikes.<br /><br />Our only qualm is the water bottles. We can not figure out how to comfortable use them to drink from. Filled with liquid, they fit comfortably in the two front pockets of the backpack, but very awkward to drink from them while in pockets (would've been much better if they came with easy-to-access straws). Taking them out of the pockets is a hassle, getting them back in near impossible without a struggle.  Drinking from the spout is very difficult also. Hence, the water bottles are poorly designed and near unusable."
4.0,"nice, classy piece, well made. my girlfriend loves it."
4.0,"Works great, I don't have a lot of credit cards so the 8 card size works for me.  It keeps the cards from getting the wear and tear you get in a leather wallet."
4.0,Bellos colgantes y muy elegantes. Fue parte de mi regalo de navidad. El diseño es elegante pero permite usar a diario.  Son de plata por lo que su calidad esta asegurada.
4.0,Fits pretty well. A bit tight in the bust and upper arm area. Sort of itchy material. May just need a few washes. A bit heavier than expected
4.0,"Aside from the sizing, the product is great and comes as shown."
4.0,"We bought these for our 9 year old daughter after seeing them in the store, just not in her size. We ordered them and she loves them!"
4.0,"Has a weird smell but very nice dress. Should have ordered one size down I'm 5' 9, 205 pounds usually order large but decided to go Xlarge this time but will have to make this size work."
4.0,"All the pockets are in all the right places. I've seen similar bags with poor storage options outside the main compartment but this comes through pretty well. I've used it for a while now and have enjoyed it.<br /><br />My only gripe would be the zippers, they don't seem particularly strong like YKK type zippers so sometimes they're not as smooth also once or twice the main compartment has unzipped on its own just because it was in an awkward position. Also I wish the waterproof pocket was slightly deeper into the bag as I often use it to store my lunch when taking it to work so my tupperware sometimes sits in an awkward position."
4.0,"I was a bit concerned about the thinness of the material at first - stretchy knit. It looked good when I tried it on, but spanx or something similar will be needed as it shows panty lines, lumps, bumps, etc... The dress is a bit plain so I added a belt which helps. Good for work, casual events, can be dressed up or down. Fits as expected - I’m 5’4” 115 lbs."
4.0,Looks good! Have not had a chance to wear it.
4.0,My daughter loves it. Didn't notice the bar was bent until I opened it up for her! Now she won't put it down. Made it part of her Easter basket box! Lol
4.0,"The Flux Polarized Fashion Sunglasses are a pretty typical set of sunglasses that you would see at most convenience or Big Box store.<br /><br />Out of the box, you get the sunglasses (I got the blue lenses and the matte black frames), a nice nylon carrying bag (with draw string), and a cleaning cloth.  The bag is plenty big for the glasses and the cleaning cloth is also nice and large.<br /><br />The glasses, although polarized, are only semi-reflective so that when the lighting is right, you can easily see people's eyes.  The lenses also have a funny aspect as the blue lenses have a rose tint when you look through them and the red lenses have a blue tint when you look through them.  Pretty cool.<br /><br />The frames are hard plastic with about the last 4&#34; of the ear pieces being black rubber.  The nose bridge is actually held onto the glasses with screws, which I've never seen before.  I guess this allows you to replace the bridge if you break it - which I don't think I ever have.<br /><br />As far as fit, they were on the small size for my head.  They fit over my ear very well, but the frames squeezed my head.  Since the whole frame is plastic, there was no adjustment available.  Because of this, I ended up give the glasses to my daughter.  I don't think I have an overly sized head so they appear to be sized for an average person who is smaller than me.<br /><br />Overall, I really liked Flux Polarized Fashion Sunglasses even if I can't wear them for too long before I get a headache.  The $24.99 price is a little bit on the high end for a basic set of sunglasses like this, but I think getting the drawstring bag and the cleaning cloth makes up for it."
4.0,A bit large and way too long however it is very pretty and I got a lot of compliments on it.
4.0,The material is not very stretchy and kinda cheap. Cute design and well made though. Had to return it.
4.0,"Adorable design and decent quality, but the fit was weird!  The horizontal stripes did not line up and they made my chest look strange.  Ended up returning in favor of another more flattering dress"
4.0,Love the scarf wasn't the color I ordered but its workable with my wardrobe
4.0,These gloves are a very good deal. I just found that they run a little small.
4.0,I bought for a friend. She love the shirt.
4.0,You need an adapter to fill with butane
4.0,"Great bag - looks good, made well.  My only complaint is that the straps tangle a bit too easily in the metal buckle on the sides. Other than that, great bag."
4.0,Feels lovely and fits like a dream
4.0,"These lights do what they say they do.  But, there is only one problem.  The band that they use to strap the lights to your fingers is very cheap.  If you have thick fingers then these bands will break.<br /><br />It's a child's toy, not something to go to a rave in."
4.0,Arrived with small hole in the sweatshirt.
4.0,"I am thrilled to have been able to replace my faded cover on my tropishade brand umbrella i ordered last year from Amazon. I had since painted my house and the door is a dark blue teal. This shade accentuated the door and matching large flower pot and really looks nice when approaching my house. We have a walled in front yard with drought tolerant plants and a nice set of lawn furniture in the front yard that needs to look nice year round . I will reorder covers only from Bellrino decor again.<br />Color is identical to what it appears in the picture.<br />Fit is better than original cover<br />Material is slightly thinner than original<br />Material is kinda wrinkly, hoping it loses the creases in the elements soon<br />Easy way to spruce up your yard.<br />For about 20$ my patio set got a new lease on life and my front yard looks fresh again.<br />This shade is already fading, it's been up for from August 27th to September 9th and there is a noticeable difference in color from the top to the underside. My next purchase will be a white umbrella shade. So four stars for the great fit, and for the price and color, but less one star for quick fading. 😔"
4.0,"These were great. The size was right and they are light and don't stick to you. They fit a little bit odd, as the front and back are the same length, but it doesn't  wear so funny that you mess with them. Perfect for under shorts or skirts."
4.0,"I love it!!  I can still see the color of my phone. I haven't dropped it yet, so not sure how well it protects but it seems very durable."
4.0,I think you get what you see and pay for.  I am satisfied.
4.0,I gave only 4 stars bcuz the sizes are not good. The mediun barely fits and the large is to big the size 8 should be available in the medium
4.0,The Girls Small is a 7/8. At this point there is nothing on the size chart above 3T so hopefully this helps someone else avoid a return.
4.0,"I thought they were so beautiful, but are very different than the photos shown. Not returning, so I will make them work."
4.0,"I've had Casio watches in the past, and this one is just what I wanted, and just as I expected it to be.  A good solid basic watch.....keeps good time, and has all the features I wanted.  I would have given it five stars if the light did more than just illuminate the left edge of the display - it's virtually useless."
4.0,It’s a beautiful color & just the right size. The only reason for a 4 star review is that one of the prongs isn’t flush with the stone & is catching on things. I’m a little worried it might come loose & the stone will get lost.
4.0,Just a little too long. The others I've purchased are a too short. I'll figure something out. I'd rather have it too long.
4.0,Price. Look  size
4.0,"This was really cute and simple. It was a little big when I first tried it on, so I had to bend the metal a little bit to fit. It has changed color a little since I've had it, which has been about a month, but that's mainly due to me forgetting to take it off before the shower. Overall I'm satisfied"
4.0,"Shiny material, so it shows your body shape a little too much.<br />Overall fit is good if you follow the size chart provided."
4.0,Las gafas se salen
4.0,Nice 3 piece set of bracelets.  Each is adjustable.  Comes with two polishing cloths and jewelry store type box.
4.0,"I get so many compliments on this. Love the design and colors. Very well made.<br />Update. After 4 months of daily use inside a purse,  the outer corners are worn bare.  The inside pocket are coming apart from use. Was hoping it would last longer, but for the money I guess that’s long enough."
4.0,"Very nice dress. Bought a size small, I’m about 5’3” 125 lbs. It’s a tad bit longer than I would have liked, but nothing major. The material is very comfortable. It bunches a little towards the top, but if you are “top heavy” you have nothing to worry about (I’m on the lesser side of that spectrum). Thinking about buying it black also."
4.0,"My daughter is just now wearing a size 2T.  I exchanged this item for a 3T.  It is slightly too big, but the 2T was too small.  I like the shirts, but do feel they are slightly over priced."
4.0,Looking forward to wearing this for those spring and summer days. Fits great! Will add a belt for more style.
4.0,The end can slip through if not careful but good otherwise.
4.0,"It's a nice bra to sleep in, stays on well, it can a little scratchy after wearing it for a while but the middle has nice and soft cotton feel. I wash it in the washer and hang dry it and parts of it seem to be wearing off a little. And could be just a tab bigger on me. But I do appreciate the size being smaller band and bigger cup area. Other bras usually have too big band if it fits in my cups."
4.0,Soo cute but they run a little big.
4.0,Warm and comfy but lacking good butt coverage...not where i want a draft
4.0,"I was looking for a chunky gold necklace and found this one. The gold color is just right, not too bright and gaudy looking. The weight is also quite heavy which I like."
4.0,"cute but too long for me, I'm 5'3"""
4.0,"I have a big head.  Like what I consider to be super big (size 8+).  These glasses are big, but actually TOO big.  I gave them four stars because they are exactly what they say they are - XXL sunglasses, but you would have to have a freakishly large head for them to look &#34;normal&#34; on you."
4.0,the only problem that I noticed is wearing it and connect the hook
4.0,I got this for one of my older daughters and she seems happy with it. She likes it - so that's all that matters right?
4.0,Beautiful dress fits perfectly. Would highly recommend.
4.0,I was very happy with how the swim suit fitted me.
4.0,A little on the small side. I ordered so. However  next size up I'm afraid would be to big. Over all I love it....
4.0,Very sexy and I'm very petite
4.0,"I got too strong of a magnifying strength, but they look unbelievable."
4.0,"I ordered the red dress to wear for my graduation. It’s more of a burgandy than red, which I really like. I’m 5’8”, 115 lbs and while the length wasn’t an issue (yay!), it was a bit large around my waist, and I’ll need to take it in about 2 inches. Overall, it looks really nice on me though, and I’m super excited. Material a bit thick, but breathable."
4.0,"I bought these to wear on not so cold nights, but to keep my cold legs warm at night. (They are always cold when I sleep.) they definitely keep my legs warm. I have skinny legs, but they are a little tight on my thighs. I still enjoy wearing them."
4.0, Got these flipflops recently and have used it for the last 3+ weeks every day. The flipflops are comfortable and the fit is good. There is no friction in the fingers which I have had with some other flipflops in the past. They have thick rubber at the bottom which provides a good cushion and support to the feet. I wore these and walked around for about 30 – 45 mins to test and I did not have any problems.<br /><br />The top layer on the left slipper was not well glued to the rubber sole. This was a little disappointing and makes me wonder how long it will last especially when exposed to water every day. This did not get any worse in the last 3+ weeks that I have been wearing though.<br /><br />I am going to continue to wear this one and will update my review if it gets worse.
4.0,It looks sturdy and very nice
4.0,Product is okay for what you pay.
4.0,"These are good adjustable bands for the money. Easy to put on or remove. Looks nice, great for casual wear."
4.0,"They look great, and very comfortable"
4.0,I needed a top loose enough and easy enough to keep one arm straight and get in and out of after surgery. These did the trick! And short sleeve for PT was a definite plus!
4.0,My husband likes this mask.
4.0,"I have two pair of the ThinOptics version that this pair of glasses is based on. I like them but the connection of the temple arms to the glasses has broken on both. I was looking for something similar to those but maybe not, you know, $50 bucks a pop! These are a little thicker and so maybe a little more durable that the ThinOptics and work equally well. The leatherette slip ""case"" is OK ... not as nice as the magnetic metal cases for the ThinOptics but then they're not $50."
4.0,"Although the material on this mask was too heavy to actually stay tight in the face for the stretch bands around the ears, the company was at least willing to work with me regarding a return. Because this was not a high priced item, they were willing to at least credit my account for part of the expense of an item that wasn’t going to work for its purpose."
4.0,I gave this review a 4 simply because these are very cute and very well-made however if you are a size 12 like me you had better order a extra large or maybe even larger.  Too long 2. Asians sizes are much smaller than America sizes and you would think that after dealing with Amazon as many years as they have they would figure that out.  ???🤔
4.0,Unique and affordable option with plenty of ways to get creative!
4.0,My sister loved them. Backs are extremely sharp though.
4.0,"They're nice, but some broke as soon as you pick them up."
4.0,"Good grip, wore them around the house on hard floors to test.<br /><br />Should work really well for maternity ward walking."
4.0,I love the material and it is high quality. I did not realize it was not full length and this should be part of the description of the robe.
4.0,Mostly what was expected. A little small but they still work.
4.0,"Item was folded and compressed to a very small size which made me very skeptical  of the quality. After unpacking and unfolding though, bag turned out to be very well made and sturdy. I stuffed it with plastic bags to get the wrinkles and folds out and it came back to life after an overnight."
4.0,"As with the other reviews, I too found that the bottom snaps wouldn't stay snapped. I ordered big because of the reviews and they still didn't stay snapped. Overall satisfied, just wish they would take the reviews and improve their product.."
4.0,"Costume fits well all around. Judging by reviews and sizing chart I ordered a small.<br />I'm 5'8 and 150 pounds. Slim runners body.<br />Package arrived in two days with expedited shipping.<br />The only issue is the package didn't have the gray looking covers that go over the buttons for the cape.<br />Other than that, great costume."
4.0,"The dress is gorgeous and fits perfectly. I am 5'2"" and weigh approximately 155 pounds and I ordered a size Small. It wasa perfect fit."
4.0,I bought it for my daughter because she had just had a baby an she wanted something to cover her stomach. And it fits her just right.
4.0,"I bought it for a gift, so I hope it is liked"
4.0,"This is my third Bison belt.  The simple yet sturdy design is essential when in the back country and my personal ensemble for this years Appalachian Trail trek. Light weight, simple yet elegant design.  You have to appreciate the simplicity of this belt.  It can not be broken folks, it's that strong."
4.0,Ordered xl and it runs a little big
4.0,"A little thin, but beautiful design. Lovely otherwise"
4.0,Got it quickly.  Looks just like original but the materials it's made from is much less plyable then the one that comes with the Fitbit originally ... once you mold it to your wrist it is fine.
4.0,I would have to say that this ring was actually quite nicer then I expected it to be. I bought it for my wife as a valentines/aniversary surprise. When we received the ring it looks better in person then it had on the pictures online and is a bit larger as well.<br /><br />Overall it is a better deal then I had thought it would be however it's not a diamond or anything super fancy. But it is great costume type jewelery and is a sturdy ring as well so it won't fall apart easy.
4.0,Loved the fit. Hated the green color in person. Will return for different color.
4.0,Good quality not bad for what it is
4.0,"The quality seems to be good and my son said it's nice and warm, which is why I<br />bought these. I purchased this 2-pack set and only received one set. However, the vendor reimbursed me for the missing set."
4.0,"The fabric is odd, slippery poly blend. I expected that though, and have no issues with it. I got it for a party/Halloween outfit. The sleeves were tight.<br />Lovely galaxy pattern."
4.0,Very happy; would recommend this band.  Cool design...
4.0,Purse is beautifully embroidered and is quite roomy but it smells of plastic and doesn't look like leather.
4.0,"Very Awesome Ear Piece, It futs and when I got it there was 5 layers of bubbble wrap and it had a very pretty box, but im 13 and the dragon fits my ear and its very comfortable."
4.0,like it but runs very small
4.0,Nice but I wanted a little more creamy color. This is a shade too brown
4.0,"The lightweight ankle support brace is slim fitting for superior comfort am not sure if it can be worn all day. It feels tight after 4hours of wearing and probably needs to be worn more to expand it. The nylon fabric keeps feet dry. It improves circulation, reduces inflammation, and expediting is flexible, durable, and washable. The open-toe design makes it easy to fit all shoe sizes."
4.0,It’s so cute and light! Fit perfectly!
4.0,"This is a more revealing swim coverup.  This focuses on the cleavage, so if you have got it, flaunt it!"
4.0,To big had to return them. I like the swim suit great quality and look just like the picture. The hot pick color 🔥. I wish I had enough time to replace it but leaving for vacation
4.0,A gift and they loved it and it looks exactly like the picture.
4.0,This skull cap doesn't stretch much. It's really tight on the ears. If you choose to free your ears from under the caps edge it is very uncomfortable. I'm giving it four stars because although it didn't fit on me how I wanted it to someone with a smaller head might have a different story.
4.0,"Runs a bit large. I have a 38&#34; chest and originally ordered a medium.  Had to return it as it was too baggy.  Order the small instead and it fits much better.  Just a bit tight around the upper hips, but I like it snug there to keep out drafts.  Overall it's warm and seem to be made wel."
4.0,"This was a gift and arrived three weeks early. It's a very good design and pressure sturdy. It flows a beautiful blue. My daughter loved it. The jump ring came off and had to be replaced but other than that, a nice gift."
4.0,It alright
4.0,This little pouch is very nice and will serve me well at the upcoming Ren Fest. The loops are a nice size and will fit a very substantial belt. I did replace the leather tie with a braided linen tie so that I could accommodate the size of my phone.
4.0,Fits as expected. Warm and comfortable sweat pants.
4.0,"This Is a good start for beginners to switch their Nintendo DS Lite systems... before you buy this, prepare to have the top screen replaced with a new non-official model."
4.0,"It fits much better on the mi smart 6 then the mi smart 5. It fits on 5 but it’s very loose, however, on the 6? Fits perfectly."
4.0,Excellent purse for college football games.  New security requires clear purses.
4.0,Kinda small for an XL.
4.0,a little scratchy too.  nice hood and belt and pocket combo.  tight fitting.
4.0,Little loose around the waist/hips. If you want tighter go smaller
4.0,"These are beautiful and pretty much my favorite earrings. However they are delicate and don't last very long. Since they are inexpensive, I buy three pair at a time whenever they're available.<br /><br />I can't tell you how many compliments I've received over these earrings!"
4.0,The style is nice but the asymmetrical piece needs to be shorter (too long). I wanted to send it back but missed my return date
4.0,Great for a night out
4.0,"Wonderfully crafted and pretty. Loved the way they looked but my skin turned green in a few hours. I know it's a thing that happens, but sucks."
4.0,The shipping was fast but the length is very different then shown in the picture.it is much shorter but if you don't have short/thin hair you may have a hard time putting it on.but other then that the quality of the wig is very good
4.0,"Zeta Open Toe Compression 20-30 mmHg Socks in size XL offer comfortable compression that fits my large calves. I appreciate the fabric combination of 73% Cotton/ 19% Spandex/ 8% Nylon; it's much more pleasant against my skin than the typical combination of nylon/spandex. The only thing I've noticed when looking through Zeta Wear's Amazon page is that the size XL open-toe stockings are only available in black; it would be nice if there were more colors to work out in and beige for underneath dresses.<br /><br />The Bottom Line: Zeta Wear Open Toe compression socks offer excellent compression at the reasonable price of $21.99, although there aren't additional colors in size XL, I will be ordering more pairs."
4.0,I really like the hat! It’s a little big on me but easy to position to look good! For this reason I am able to keep and enjoy it! Very well made!
4.0,"I like this band, it's flexible and not to rough on my skin. But, I bought a light and dark color. After 2 weeks of regular wear, the light color looks dirty and wouldn't come clean. Stick to the dark colors."
4.0,"These are cute and well made, but they fit oddly on me. I'm not sure if I bought a size too big or the cut is just not suited to my body."
4.0,Cute pieces
4.0,"I bought men's large socks, for my son, to help keep his feet drier. Nice socks, but they shrink too much after drying them. They make them too tight on his feet"
4.0,Seems to work fine to make large hats fit better.  No problems
4.0,The little romper is adorable however the color is way off in person.
4.0,"Material is a little thin, so it feels a little cheap but it fits great and feels good to wear."
4.0,"Beautiful! but definitely small. Ordered for my bridesmaids who all have small wrists, thankfully. Don't order if you have to get your bracelets a little on the larger side. The reviews all said they run small and they are accurate."
4.0,I bought this band to go with my new Apple Watch. It is very comfortable and easy to install. I’ve used it for a few months and it still looks new.
4.0,"I purchased this to use with my diaper bag. The strap is good quality, but the shoulder pad part is uncomfortable on my shoulder. I ended up taking it off and just use the strap plain. Save yourself the extra dollar and just buy they one without that extra pad."
4.0,I'm 5'4 and weigh 110 pounds.  The dress fits me perfectly.  The material is nice and comfortable. The dress is short and sexy.  The one complaint that I have is that when you walk the dress rides up a little bit but for the price I would not complain.
4.0,Only thing I didn’t like was the elastic in the ankles. Too tight. So I cut the elastic and removed it and inserted a shoe lace that I can tie at my choice. Tied it big enough to get my foot through. Cut off the ends. Slight atPerfect!
4.0,"They look a lot more pastel than I was expecting, but they’re still cute and functional."
4.0,"The dress is a little snug but in a good way, like it holds everything in. I ordered my true size and loved the way it looks. Great quality for the price. Would love to order this in the white when it becomes available in my size. I am 5'1&#34;, 135, and I ordered a medium."
4.0,Tvery true to size and and material are great plan to buy another set
4.0,The shirts are well made but a little thinner in material than I expected.  Still it's a very good buy and I reveived my shipment promptly.
4.0,"This little sweat/jacket is lovely,  a better quality than I ever expected. The fabric has a lot of body and it appears to be very well made. My granddaughter has not put it on yet so I cannot attest to its fit, but I look forward to seeing her in it.  I did note that it has to be hand washed, which I can understand since it is cotton and I presume the bright red color may run a bit,  but since it is an outer garment  that should not be a problem."
4.0,Very small but cute!
4.0,"This is a comfortable, warm, well-made robe. My only reservation was that I had been hoping for a heavier robe."
4.0,"I got this to wear as a maternity dress. I don’t like where the waist falls, but I can easily adjust it. The dress is VERY comfortable and falls pretty much right to the floor (I’m 5’1)<br />Love the pockets too!"
4.0,Love the shirt but does run small. I wear a L to XL. Got an XL as a gift and it is super tight across my chest. Don’t have a gift receipt so don’t know how to return it. Bought an XXL and it fits nice.
4.0,This is an excellent protect for which I've only seen 2 issues:<br />1. The side clip is made from plastic and seems kinda cheap. This is ok since I mainly use the back strap when carrying the case with me.<br />2. The enterior is huge. This is only an issue when storing my regular glasses in the case while wearing my sunglasses.
4.0,"Construction is 10/10. However, the stones dyed my wrist with blue color twice. I was able to wash the blue with soap and water, but I don't know now if this is a natural stone and if the dye is dangerous to the skin or not."
4.0,Lots of zippered compartments to organize my essentials and small pocket inside the purse body. Strap included is adjustable and easily snaps on and off. I wasn’t particularly fond of the strap material so I chose to use one of my embroidered straps. Two of the zippers are brown and hide well while the other two are silver. Not sure why it was designed this way. Overall it’s a great crossbody for casual wear.
4.0,It was not at all loose and flowy
4.0,"At first I loved the hoops and still like them because they don't irritate my skin and are easy to get on and off. Over time however, in the photo you can see how one has lost it's color and is now just gold which is really disappointing. I guess that fact is made up with the fact that it comes with two of them which is why I decided four stars for these hoops."
4.0,"I like this product, but it really runs small. I ordered it according to the size chart, but it was really tight on me. I called Amazon and told the person that I talked to that I really like it and when I send it back and get my return money back on my card, I will order another one in a bigger size.<br />Thank You, Beverly"
4.0,Perfect fit material easily wrinkles... but my daughter looked gorgeous
4.0,Love that super cute
4.0,"I've had so many compliments on these.  I have prescription sunglasses,  but love these since I don't have to switch them!"
4.0,"The camo pattern is great, the pockets with buttons that feels good.<br />The bads are the main pockets feels too small and you can see the inside part when you seat down.<br />Feels a little tight on the back, but not terrible.<br />Just isn’t your baggy camo shorts."
4.0,SO cute! Love them. The little one finds them a little uncomfortable on her ears but perhaps she isn't used to wearing glasses.
4.0,"I liked them, but they were just too big"
4.0,"My cards are held securely. The plastic mesh screen allows my card to be read with the human eye and a card reader. The zippered pocket is somewhat small, but I am able to place 2-3 bills in there because they can be folded. A card would not fit."
4.0,The dress was a little tight for a 3x which is her normal size of clothes
4.0,"the dress is pretty sexy and cute, but turned out a little too big, at 110 5^6 small is loose from waist down, ill have to sew it in. Quilty of the dress is okay too, not that great but i guess to wear once a year it will work"
4.0,I like it would recommend.
4.0,I feel like they’re easy to break.
4.0,had to return too large for me but still a nice dress. I had to buy a smaller size.
4.0,Easy to carry around in the case. Great deal for 3 pairs to keep them at home and work.
4.0,I bought this cute scarf .. took forever though to come through but i love it all in all ..just wished it was a bit longer
4.0,This is a great pendant and I love it. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is the chain is a bit thick and heavy for a woman's chain and it is already getting tarnished.
4.0,Great timing and quality.
4.0,Worked fi e 4 what I needed
4.0,Very nice shades cool mirrored lenses the side shields are such an added cool feature .<br /><br />The only con is the to slide a little on the noise but otherwise nice sunglasses
4.0,Nice but no ear it's been herd trying to find something to match up with them
4.0,"(Blue and white style)<br />These shoes arrived early, which was good because my toddler's old shoes wore through. I really like that the rubber on the bottom is very soft and thin, which allows for a more natural walking experience but provides a little waterproofing (although if the rubber area were a little bigger, it would be even more waterproof). I like that my toddler can unstrap the velcro himself, and is starting to try to put on, take off, and strap the velcro closed himself. They are a little loose and very easy to get on my toddler.<br />Only complaint is that unlike the picture, the shoe has extra material/space that sticks out behind my toddler's heel. Other than that, these shoes seem to be very well constructed."
4.0,"These backs are adequate, but a little snug over my earring posts.  Also, they show a little below my ears, but maybe that is my fault some how!  Also my bad - I thought I was getting two pairs, because it said 'Sold in pairs of two.'  I now realize I was reading that wrong.  I am giving this pair to my daughter, and will order another pair for myself.  In spite of showing under my ears, I like how they stabilize heavy earrings so they don't feel like they are falling forward."
4.0,Super cute shorts! Small fit perfect and I’m usually a 4/6. The red flower print is better than the leopard print though. The materials are completely different. The leopard didn’t have pockets and looks like satin while the red has pockets and is more like rayon.
4.0,"When I say it runs large, I mean it runs long. I am short, so I am going to need to get this shortened."
4.0,"Product warms stomach when using while exercising.  Makes a little ripple in the back while wearing but is to be expected while doing a lot of movement.  Unsure if it works yet, I haven't had it long enough to see results yet but I like wearing it while doing my workouts."
4.0,"adorable ring, just a little too yellow in color looks like fake gold, but defiantly better than I expected for only $3.50."
4.0,"it's ok, a bit overpriced."
4.0,I love the had but it suffered in the shipping.  I don't know if I will ever get it back to its original shape.
4.0,really comfortable.
4.0,Wanted more noise blocking and not so bulky...but otherwise very nice indeed.
4.0,I really like the cut of these pjs and the feel of the material.  I ordered using the size chart but the pjs are at least a size to large.  I am 5'8&#34; tall and the pants are a bit short. I will give these to my daughter and definitely reorder in a smaller size.
4.0,Nice band but the white does stain easily.
4.0,"Returned item was too small, but super cute and now waiting on refund."
4.0,very cute slip dress. sorta short but it doesn’t stick to you like other slip dresses do
4.0,"I like these tops, other than the fact that they are a little short in the torso."
4.0,"The dress is heavier than I expected. For the price it's great! I was a little worried honestly that it would be super chinsy but it's not. Fits pretty well for what it is, not perfect at alll but can be worn cute and I'll use it for sure."
4.0,Almost to small.  But I am using it all of the time and I am pleased.
4.0,Just need to be aware the large size it a bit large. I think I'd purchase the medium size if I ordered this product again.
4.0,Great protection for the beach.
4.0,Very comfortable and warm. The non-skid sole sort of grabs the carpet and feels like it sticks. I am still glad I bought them -no slipping on my hardwood floors!
4.0,I'm a size 27 or 5 in pants and this was kinda tight on the hips but the material is good so it's a pretty good purchase overall
4.0,"This product bit a bit small, but I don’t have that big of a head. The mouth was difficult to move."
4.0,Buen producto excelente proteccion para tus ojos
4.0,"I should also have stated that my girlfriend is petite, and that's what surprised her by the shortness of the chain"
4.0,"This is a nice  light weight flannel robe, long length.  I'm 5'7"" tall and  the hem reaches to a few inches above my ankle.  Good quality fabric; it washed well and and didn't pill.  Very well made and the piping is a nice touch.  I would order it again.  I gave it 4 stars, though, because it has only one pocket and that feels weird to me."
4.0,This dress is super cute. It has a nice fit and flow. I have a small belly pooch and it hides it completely. Rekindled my love of wearing dresses.
4.0,"Love this necklace. I'm giving it 4 stars due to the fact that some of the connecting pieces are a bit loose,  but aren't hard to tighten with jewelry pliers. For the price,  I have to say this is a heck of a deal as it goes with everything!"
4.0,"Soft, beautiful color, large, warm, and static-y, but I've been working to counteract that. Not really true Pashmina Cashmere, if that's what you're looking for in your order. Real Cashmere does not collect static, rubs off balls of fluff if you roll the fabric in your fingers (and this one does not) and most real Cashmere scarves do not have fringe- just a rough cut edge. But still, the scarf is beautiful, and I'm very happy with my purchase."
4.0,"Really like it, but a little pricey compared to similar hats."
4.0,I've purchased &#34;big hats&#34; in the past but these are REALLY BIG.  but the quality is good and the price is right
4.0,Dad likes it
4.0,Some pieces have broken off but I do like the size and extra compartments
4.0,This is a very pretty dress and it fit almost perfect.  I bought a small.  I am 5'6&#34; and 135 lbs.  It was a little big around the arm holes and gaped some.  This was the only thing that I didn't like.  The dress is well made and the lace is soft.  Fully lined.  I recommend this dress.
4.0,"It's all that wanted, just looks &#34; cheap&#34; but I am happy with the design, love the skeleton effect. And the chain is long enough to fit on a pocket"
4.0,It's a comfortable enough hat to replace my previous slouchy.  The only annoying part is the tag on the lip of the hat getting in the way and being an irritant.
4.0,Very pretty but much smaller than expected size. Great shipping/arrival time!
4.0,Great work dress. Looks good. Got a small to tight on my breast but i am a DDD.
4.0,"These sandals are very stylish and fit a little lose. Very comfortable but I had to return them because it was slightly loose on my feet and I know as time goes on, it is going to get worse. Other than that, I have no problem with these sandals."
4.0,"Surprisingly, this product works!  I wear a mask with glasses a few hours a day and it really helps reduce the amount of breath fog.  It can make your glasses harder to keep clean bit that seems like a small inconvenience compared to foggy vision."
4.0,I wore this in vacation and got lots of compliments. I am small chested and it still flatters me.
4.0,"I got these for my husband. He has been ordered bu the doctor to wear compression socks all the time. The medical ones are very expensive and cery hard to put on. These are like his relaxing socks, they compress, but not that much and are a lot easier to put on. He wears these the days he feels he wants to rest from the others."
4.0,"Nice top, runs small."
4.0,Very nice fit true tonsize
4.0,Nice skirt. I got a medium. My waist is 31” and the waist of the skirt was a little too loose. Will adjust it.
4.0,Nice dress (: but I stay stick with your actual size
4.0,Very nice pants other than being to small. They have a very straight butt and hip and most women are not built that way. Nice material and good quality.
4.0,Very warm and fit perfectly.<br />Much bulkier than I thought they'd be and don't like not having my whole thumb covered.
4.0,Beautiful.  Great deal and super fast shipping.
4.0,She's a fun piece in my haunt. Only down fall is sound is a bit distorted due to background noise
4.0,"Very cute. Quality is just ok, not superb. But okay for the price."
4.0,"Very thin material.  I know that it wasn't an expensive dress but you can see my bra through the material.  And for $25ish dollars, I think it should be a bit better."
4.0,"Nice waffle weave robe at a very good price!  It does run large.  Bought for Dad who is 5'5 and 200 pounds and it just about drags on the floor.  I suggest ordering one size smaller.  Great price,good product."
4.0,"I like the looks of the glasses.  They are fairly comfortable, except that the bottom hits my cheeks (hence the 4 stars).  I think I can get accustomed to that. It's the curvature of the glasses that cause it.  I wanted non Polaroid for driving, for better viewing of the led panels on the dash."
4.0,Definitely a standout and comfortable addition to the collection. I don’t find a lot of diamond ties.
4.0,"Would be 5 stars, EXECPT TOTAL LACK OF INSTRUCTIONS.  Had to google for instructions, especially to re-size"
4.0,"Beautiful Jewelry, fast shipping!  Will do business again."
4.0,A little shear but adorable.
4.0,The hat came well packaged and in perfect condition.  I read other reviews complaining about the at brim is down all the war around and not flat on the sides with more turn down front and back.  Mine arrived the same way but reshaping was very easy.  Hat brim is now perfect.  I am rating only four stars as I cannot speak to the durability as I have only had the hat for 1 week.  Great hat at a great price.
4.0,"Adorable dress! I'm 5'7&#34; and it was long enough for me. I am quite small up top (34A) and it was a snug fit (XS). The arms were snug as well; anyone with toned arms would be uncomfortable in an XS. It is roomy in the bottom half, and the slit is fun for movement. Definitely recommend. If you like it loose fitting, go up a size."
4.0,"Fit perfect and I really like the length of the shirt, I'll probably buy another one."
4.0,"Wasn't expecting much from a watch that was less than eight bucks. Keeps time and was pleasantly surprised at what you get for the price, but we'll see how long it lasts."
4.0,the shirt fit as expected and looks really great.
4.0,Really cute... spelling is def off but the fit n design is cute so for me it over shadows the Vancouve. I’m 5”7 n 161. I’m hippy with a small upper body and long torso. I usually wear a medium and I ordered a Medium. It’s actually kind of lose but I figure it will shrink some. Contemplating ordered another color just in a small... my advice order one size down for a tighter to the body fit n your actual size for a looser fit...
4.0,"This shirt runs a bit larger than expected. It is a cute shirt. I like it,"
4.0,Wore these for two weeks to help decide if I wanted to make the commitment to the real thing. They're so cute!
4.0,Not sure why my daughter wanted these but we bought them for her and she loves them...so there.
4.0,"These glasses are nice and very stylish.  My only complaint is that they are HUGE. I wanted big glasses, but these are very big and cover most of my face, which my face is by no means at all small. I think the size would be great as sunglasses, but my plan was to have them made into prescription glasses.  I wish they had the same style and shape, but only a tad bit smaller to fit the face better.  I think I look like a major nerd in them. Also, they are a little heavy and slide a lot off my nose not staying in place so you constantly have to move them up on your face."
4.0,"Pretty colors. No extra room, fits tight to my head. Is small for a bouffant cap"
4.0,I did like the shirt.
4.0,Small but nice design.
4.0,Getting the links out is fairly difficult and the tool chips paint off the band if you're not careful. Great watch otherwise.
4.0,Good for the pool or beach.  Great size too
4.0,"I always look for something different to wear that is the reason I chose this boots!!! I absolutely love the design; they are very sexy and I received many compliments when I wear it!!! However, they were a bit taller than I expected...not a big deal though!!! Very happy with the product and I got them really fast which I loved it!!!!"
4.0,This is fairly see through as shown although the reflective metallic threads make it harder to see through in bright light than dim. It does not restrict airflow in the slightest. I got it to use for when other protections for Covid19 are in place such as plastic shielding but there is a need or want to have on a face covering in solidarity but with a need for lip reading (pic1). It can also go on over a regular protective mask (pic2) or in a pinch folded multiple times to make it more protective (pic3).  I also use masks when I get a cold and breathing in cold air hurts and this has just enough material to keep some warm air next to my face.<br />The scarf has scalloped edges on the top and bottom - I had to turn the top portion inside 1/2 to 1 inch in order for it to stay up and to be able to talk without the fabric going in and out of my mouth.  There is a seam that runs down the back and small ear holes on the top edge.
4.0,The hat had an area on top that was crushed down.  I was not able to push it back up and did not have time to look for another one. Looked beautiful and i will use it again.
4.0,"Really cute, washed well.  Nice quality."
4.0,"Nice easy, casual dress for me. I am short (5'1&#34;) so it comes a tad below my knees. Was hoping it would be shorter on me. Had to buy the extra large because of my top. Fits fine on the top but extra billowy from there down. Again, I was hoping for not so much billow. Not the manufacturer's fault, just my body, I guess. I wear it on really hot days (live in Florida) around the house or for a quick run to the store.Just wanted to note that it may be more billowy than it looks. Especially if you have a bigger top."
4.0,"Needed to trim out the eyes for comfort, and I also wore a 'cooltemp' headgear cap to allow me to keep on all night without sweating."
4.0,"Like ""  Needed to go larger next time"
4.0,"I ordered the black, long sleeve option and had to fix it up a little by cutting some extra strings off of the floral embroidery detail. This top fits nicely though; I like how it looks."
4.0,The plastic lenses aren’t as clear as shown in picture but they do look good. They are very light so I don’t even notice they are in my earlobes.
4.0,Very cute form fitting top. Tight in the bust area.
4.0,Nice earrings the post are a bit long but won’t sleep in them
4.0,"Good case except for the fact that it has a really strong smell, not a good one! Makes my glasses smell funny, hoping I can find a way to air it out or weaken the smell, dryer sheets did not work. Other than that I think it's a good case."
4.0,My daughter leaves the shoes on while she takes off other shoes off.
4.0,"the costume fit like i had hope and it is made of good quality,  was a little disappointed in no pants and no gloves.  Otherwise was perfect."
4.0,"good price,  fast delivery."
4.0,"I purchased and quickly received this black pullover sweater (not a sweatshirt) in size medium. For a sweater under $10, this was a great buy! The sweater is thin but not see through, and fits well, comfortable and not tight or loose. I took a star off only because I would have preferred the length of the sweater to be a bit longer. An inch would have made a difference, but otherwise, I love the unique style, especially the lantern sleeves, and looks just like the photo. I am 5’, 130 lbs and 34D, and I usually wear a size medium, so this top was true to size."
4.0,I ordered these for a trip I'm taking and these are comfortable and look great.
4.0,"A family member bought this hat and I got it as no one else wanted it.<br /><br />I had a hat similar to this one until the electronics in it failed around mid winter. That had also didn't have the electronics all that well secured and they were hard to get to. Hopefully the electronics in this hat are more robust, so far they seem to be. The previous hat also had an issue where it woudln't turn back on for hours to a day ,this one has yet to have any similar problem.<br /><br />First off I like the hat itself, it stretches to fit and I find it pretty comfortable, and the internal zipper, which you use to get to the electronics, is hard to notice, and the leather patch on the side makes operation easy. And like I said the electronics are rather easy to get to.<br /><br />The sound quality isn't the best but I think it's pretty great for what it is, and the speakers are adjustable if you need to as there is room to either side to velcro them in place. For battery life it's still on it's first charge.<br /><br />My one complaint would be that after not too long the velcro that holds the speakers in place came loose because the adhesive failed, but that was easy enough to replace myself, so it wasn't too long before I was using it again.<br /><br />Overall I would recommend and I hope it lasts longer than the one I had."
4.0,Pretty dress but the waist is a little funny and high
4.0,"Fits snugly but I love the hat, it's not a very tall 🎩. I do like it very much a great hat!"
4.0,"I got the pink one and wash it before I tried decided if I liked it or not. It came super wrinkled and I hated it out of the bag. But it was $9 so I wasn’t going to return it. Once I washed it, it shrunk A LOT which was great for me because it was HUGE.  Once it shrunk it was perfect. I love it now and plan on getting some other colors."
4.0,Nice but smaller than I wanted
4.0,"Very cute. Fits well. Material has a nice feel. Only issue, why 4 instead of 5 stars, is that the little balls come off too easily. First wash before wear took off a couple. Now my 2 year old tugs at them so I'm sure we'll loose more. They're cute but unnecessary and will start to look bad as more come off. At that point, I'll probably cut off the remaining so you can see the damage. I recommend they redesign it without the dangling balls."
4.0,"The shoes were nice, but fit smaller than my street size. I'm returning my original pair and ordering a half size up."
4.0,"I got this for my daughter, it is very cute.  She had a black cat and I think this will remind her of him."
4.0,"should have gotten a size smaller, but they are ok to wear around the house"
4.0,"The pants appear longer in the photos, however comfortable."
4.0,"Very nice product, but the arm lengts are a little long."
4.0,Haven’t used it much yet but my friend has one and recommended it. It is very lightweight and will be a great layer.
4.0,"I ordered up one size as others said the dress ran small. For me, my normal size (s) would've been fine. Its classy and good quality."
4.0,There is no clasp.
4.0,"Cute ""momsuit"" with full coverage! The molded cups are extremely comfortable and hold great shape. The waist is a little bit baggy but hips fit well. It's hard to find a bathing suit that fits all figures though and I'm admittedly hourglass-shaped..."
4.0,Bottom row was perfect but top row was not a good fit it was large and the gold was dull but overall good product
4.0,"I'm 5 foot 9 and around 165 pounds. I got a medium, the skirt fit great, but the top was very small. It fit, but it was snug."
4.0,"Great look, especially for price! A little wide for a smaller face."
4.0,This is nicely made but sometimes scratches a bit when wearing.
4.0,Great for the price.  A little tight when worn as a headband.  I have a medium/large head.  If you wear an extra large hat size this may be too snug for you.
4.0,"I originally got this wallet because of the super minimalistic look (Could do without the Fidelo branding)<br />But full grain leather for around 17-18$? Lets give it a try. First impressions, it's your basic minimalistic wallet with a band around it. My band seems like there's glue to where the stitching meets at the end of one side of the band and only time will tell if that fails or will pose an issue. So far i've switch from my regular bifold over to this pull tab wallet. I have about 10 Cards in the wallet ranging from Titanium to metal to plastic cards. This wallet will definitely hold a lot of cards but you'll know when there's too many by how the wallet will slightly bend the cards or they will stick out the top. Overall I don't mind the quality to the price point, and I will update this review upon further use and wear of the wallet. The pull tab just pulls all the cards out and then you can fumble for them from there. I use my apple watch most of the times for my cards and only use the wallet as a back up. This fits very nicely in your pocket and its like carrying your credit cards in a fancy leather holder."
4.0,Muy buena para el calor
4.0,I love the color! It fits well except it is too long for my liking. I plan to hem mine because I do like it.
4.0,Bought these for my husband. His arms hurt when they are in the sun. He says these help. They are also nice because you can wear them and then take them off when you go indoors. I gave them four stars because they don't stay up quite far enough and leave a small gap between your shirt sleeve and the top of the arm sleeve.
4.0,The gloves came with holes in 2 fingers.  I didn't realize until I arrived at my party and put them on.  Dress was great - fit perfectly and had a great swing to it when you shimmied!
4.0,Love these socks. But they are kinda small I wear size 9 shoe.
4.0,"Cute suit, but a little small on the chest, wouldnt recommend if your cup size is bigger than a B. Im 5'7 and 150 lbs."
4.0,"I was looking for a nice pair of neutral, wedge sandals to wear this summer with my maxi dresses to keep them from dragging on the ground. I normally wear a size 5 shoe, and these fit somewhat comfortably, and are very cute. They work well with a variety of looks; I have worn them with my maxi dresses, leggings, skinny jeans and bell bottoms. Since the heel is about 3 inches high, however, I can only walk comfortably in them for about 3 hours until my feet start hurting."
4.0,"What a nice hat at a great value. I loved it so much, I bought a second one in another color. I love the no-logo look."
4.0,Lovely dress! It's well made and great quality.  I am giving it four stars only because I believe it runs big. I typically wear a small and this seems more like a medium.
4.0,"it's very comfy, the top is a lil small but i still fit the bottoms cover your butt completely so it's not inappropriate."
4.0,It fits big! I’m around 150 and it’s loose on me! I wanted to get an outfit for my daughter but she’s only 130 pounds! The small would be way too big! I would definitely recommend getting a size smaller!
4.0,It's a nice watch and it's comfortable but I didn't like how the face was kinda big for the strap and the watch has no second hand. I like having my watches be really accurate and seeing how many seconds I have left till the next minute but this doesn't have it. However for the price its worth a buy to add to a collection.
4.0,Had no issues.<br />All but one worked and I was able to adjust a little to make that one work.<br />SO all in all they are worth the money.<br />shipped fast.<br />Kids had a great time playing with them.<br /><br />GREAT DEAL
4.0,"Very cute. Fabric is pretty good, colors are great. But... Way too small. I don't think this should be billed as a womans hat. Makes it a wasted purchase."
4.0,"These shoes are adorable.  I am happy with the fit and flexibility.  The shoes remind me of stride rite brand shoes.  Durable, flexible, and easy to put on"
4.0,My son loved them. Comfy fit.
4.0,"These gloves are thin, yet very warm. They are extremely comfortable and allow me to do everyday things while wearing them, unlike bulky gloves."
4.0,Bought this for my wife as a Christmas present. It was delivered in time. The ring looked as described and even better. It was solid sturdy and had a little velvet bag. My wife loved it!
4.0,This buckle looks really good. I got the one with the horse head. It looks really nice. The feel of it is where it seems cheaper. It's lighter weight than my other buckles which makes it feel cheaper. Its held up for a week or so now. All in all it looks great and hold my belt on so it's doing what I want.
4.0,"Pants are too long.  Overweight isn't tall. Lol.  However, everyone thought hubby's and my matching set was so cute.  Accidentally bought him and I the wrong match for our set for the entire family. However I reordered the right ones but I went ahead and kept this set for just us so we both have a matching set for Winter.<br />Awww♡"
4.0,It’s like a clutch with a strap. SUPER small
4.0,A little bigger than expected.
4.0,WELL MADE PRODUCT
4.0,Beautiful pendant! I deducted one star because the material used to hold the piece oxidizes.  This can be fixed by replacing it with sterling silver or plated gold loop. Everybody loves it and I have purchased another one as a gift.
4.0,My daughter loved them but did say her toes hurt
4.0,"I really like these gloves for what I paid -low cost. I ordered them for a specific event, and had to throw away afterwards. The gloves stained my hands a light black. It did wash off with soap and water though, so no harm. I think they are perfect for a one time short event (Costume Addition), but absolutely not as a long term wardrobe piece."
4.0,"Slippers have held-up pretty well this winter, not the best but warm and worth the price."
4.0,Cute except for that bar in the middle...thinking of removing it. But they look exactly like they are shown.
4.0,"The design of these earrings is very nice, and have quite a bit of sparkle. They are about an inch in diameter. I was hoping for just a bit bigger (for some items, the size is not given, as with these), but they will do fine as well."
4.0,"I bought this bag for my sister, by just looking at it, she fell in love..a simple but a classy design, nice one by; #KennethCole-Reaction"
4.0,Good quality the zipper could have been better quality
4.0,"Great value, very happy with the purchase. I like that the stems have a spring in them so they should not easily get bent. The materials are low end, but as expected at this price point. Only complaint is that they are large and loose on me."
4.0,"Wow this is long. I love the color, the style but I can't wear it as it looks ridiculous on 5'0 me that drowns in it. It is almost like a swimsuit cover up for me. (a short one) It's a shame as it's really cute."
4.0,"Very cute lightweight pants. Polyblend fabric, matte not shiney. I followed size reccomendations,even though size chart looked ok. I wear a size 10, m or l depending. I ordered xxl because of china size and what manufacturer said. I have now reordered in L, xxl appeared to be xxl. I do have slimmer hips and butt, but I think these are sized to size chart provided. Hoping new L fit. They are cute, summer pants. I prefer cotton but these seem ok for summer."
4.0,"Ok so these nose rings are great quality and cute. The case they come in is very nice. They aren't flimsy junk rings that are more common and hard to put in. These were a bit challenging for me to put in and will take a while to get used to.<br />Complaints: they are a bit more protrusive than I would have liked and the ring didn't fully go in my nose but, per another reviewer I also used pliers to close it up a bit more. Great quality for the price, I would buy these again."
4.0,"I am bigger & wish it came in regular sizes instead of just juniors.  I bought the 2x and it works, I just wish it was a bit bigger.  Otherwise, I love it & it came promptly."
4.0,this is a great dress that is very soft! I would say fits true to size. very comfortable.
4.0,"I Love this bikini!! At first I was very concerned when I purchased this item. I've gained weight recently and did not think this would be very flattering on me but it was in my size at a good price and I loved the look so I bought it.  I got it in a size 3X because some of the reviews said it ran small. The bottoms fit perfect but the bra top was a little small, once I pulled the black straps up I had a little more room and it helped give a better fit. It looks really good on and doesn't seem to move alot,which was my concern for the top. My husband loves it and I get a lot of compliments on it as well. I took off a star because it was a little difficult to figure it out at first and the top was a little small."
4.0,cute for dress or casual
4.0,"This is my second item from this brand. The fit of their products seems a bit unusual. The large in this brand is way to small for me, but in this very light-weight unlined gaberdine overcoat in XL, I will have to shorten the sleeves. There is plenty of room in the top of this. It's a little tight through the hips, but that's more my problem than the fault of this trench coat. I like the color of this. I work with a lot of Muslim women and this is very similar to the over coat that some of them wear over their clothes at all times for modesty. This is well-made and primarily for fashion and not for warmth.<br /><br />Incidentally, in the product title they call this a ""lace up"" coat. I have no idea why and think that is an error--perhaps since this is made in another country, somewhere along the way, someone helping them translate confused lace up with button up."
4.0,"I was a little disappointed.  There is absolutely no support in these bras at all.  the material is so stretchy you can put them on by stepping into it and pulling it up, or over the head!  They are fine to sleep in but not to wear under a blouse or top.  They would probably be ok for someone that is not heavily endowed like I am.  Since that is not the fault of the seller, I gave the 4 stars."
4.0,"Good quality, block the sun well, not too flimsy. I look like Neo from “The Matrix” in these though. I’m no Bella Hadid, but I don’t think the problem here is entirely my face. These would look right in place on a glasses chain around my auntie’s neck, which is fine! Just not the look I was going for. If they weren’t so wide I could have looked like a 90s pop star. They look ok as long as I wear them all the way at the end of my nose, so I do that to simultaneously look pretentious and humble myself by looking like a fool in the name of fashion :’)"
4.0,"My only complaints are they are the tiniest bit see through (I have thick thighs), the purple isn’t as vibrant as the product image and they’re more shiny than expected. They fit true to size and I get lots of compliments in them! Love the design on the sides."
4.0,Quality leather and it will fit many cards. The only thing I would say could use improvement is a larger window for the id because about a 1/4&#34; is cut off around the edge so that you cannot view all of then information on the ID without removing the ID. This also wouldn't be so bad if they put the little circle cut out so that you could get your thumb on the ID to remove it easier but it doesn't have that either. Maybe in the next generation…
4.0,I like they can be adjusted for my hubby's short swollen feet.
4.0,Runs 2 sizes too small. I usually get a M in oversized things and I got and xl. It fit perfect
4.0,These work. A little tight tho
4.0,Love the fit. I'm short (4'11) and curvy and the medium fit excellent. I like how the ends of the pant legs sit a little above my ankle. Rated it 4 stars bc I think the pocket would be better if it could fit my phone. It's really only big enough for some cash and a key. However it's not going to stop me from ordering another pair. Still satisfied with my purchase!
4.0,Very pretty and pretty sturdy. Only difficulty I had was with removing my ID from the ID slot. I don't use it for an ID anymore because it's too difficult to remove in and out.
4.0,Love it! But the charm keeps falling off so be careful where you take it!!
4.0,I was surprised to like the shirt. Normally when seeing an item it isn't what you get.
4.0,I use these while working on my computer at work
4.0,It delivered faster than I expected from seller! I liked the quality of earrings and it looked so pretty just like in the photo!
4.0,I like these a lot but they are not as no-show as i'd like. The top part of the foot specifically goes up too high but the rest of the sock doesn't show under most of my shoes. They are comfy and feel much thicker and better quality than other no-show socks i've purchased.
4.0,"Not great for super tiny wrists, but nothing my husband can't fix with a hammer and nail."
4.0,"Great jacket. Warm, fits well, and I've gotten several compliments on how it looks."
4.0,My wife looks great in these jeggings
4.0,I wear a woman size 9 and they got fine.  If you have A smaller got these will be a little big for your foot.  They are really soft too.
4.0,It’s soft and cute. But runs really small.
4.0,"I purchased this dress for vacation and it fit perfect, and was very flattering. Not see through at all and very comfortable."
4.0,"This dress is pretty and much higher quality than I expected, but the length of the sheath under the lace is just not viable for me. I'm 6 ft tall and the slip portion just covers my butt -- absolutely no way to bend over without flashing someone! Beware if you're on the taller side that the length is definitely not close to your knees, as pictured on the (probably pretty short) models. Wish it would have fit better, as it is really a nice dress."
4.0,Very nice and perfect for my granddaughter.  For the price and to receive six necklaces makes this a great deal.
4.0,"They fit great, keep my hands warm and didn’t cost a lot of money."
4.0,"It was not quite what I was expecting.  It was a little sheer, but nice for a summer top."
4.0,Good quality-too big around for my wrist.<br />I will try and re string this and also use a better quality cord. Cool beads for the price.
4.0,This dress is gorgeous! The color is very vibrant and fits nicely once I went up a size. The only con was it wasn’t long enough for me. I’m only 5’7” and it came to my ankles instead of hitting the floor like the picture shows.
4.0,Fits well and is long enough.  Washed well.  Nice blue color
4.0,"Could have been a little thicker - but I am able to wear and still place a ""hot hands"" pack inside it on my hands -<br />So far good quality!"
4.0,UPDATE: I had to change my review from a 2 star to a 4 star because the company has excellent customer service. They reached out to me because of my review which was very nice and that means a lot to me when I know a company is going to stand by there product and help you out when there is a problem.<br /><br />These capris are good for base layer clothing but I still think they are not compression clothing. These compression capris are so thin. You do not want to wear these by themselves because they are very see through. They would be perfect to wear underneath a skirt but not my themselves. I bought these to use for running. I have other running compression base layers and they are so much better than these. They also fit a little snug. I ordered my normal size and I can wear them but they seem a little small and not because they are compression pants. (I know what compression pants are supposed to feel like)<br /><br />*I received this product for a discounted price in return for an honest review*
4.0,"I knew the necklace would be light, as the cost of gold is so high now, but it is lighter than I thought it would be. I like to feel the necklaces when wearing them. Otherwise, it nicely made, and can be worn with jeans or a nice dress."
4.0,This is super cute for nerds like myself. I take it off to shower or wash dishes and it has stretched a bit. I'll be sad when the cord breaks
4.0,"Overall as expected, material is a bit too polyester...but still nice. My daughter loves it!"
4.0,"I love it! It's exactly what I wanted. The chain it comes on is really crappy, so I suggest getting a replacement, or a backup for when it breaks. Its got a bit of weight to it, but it's not heavy. Its perfect sized too. Very happy.<br /><br />-Edit 8/22/14-<br />Don't wear for long periods of time, I got a slight rash after wearing it for a few days without taking it off, and I generally don't react badly to metal. DO NOT WASH OR WEAR IN SHOWER!!!! I forgot to take it off in the shower for about 2 mins, and most of the color came off so it looks bronze. It is still neat looking though."
4.0,"Bracelet is interesting, the charms are great"
4.0,A little lighter in color then I expected but still a nice dress
4.0,"Small but fits ALOT of stuff :  phone , keys , wallet pouch , small compact mirror , toll-on perfume , Bobby pins , pack of gum , hair tie , and small pen . The adjustable strap makes it easy to adjust to my preferred length . It’s convenient for short outing"
4.0,Very comfortable. I enjoy wearing them to work.
4.0,Ordered this fin size8/10 for 8year who is on lean and tall side. Fits nice so far and he loves them day and night.. Good quality..Hope it will last for next 2 winters
4.0,"Great prayer shawl, this was a gift but I plan to purchase one for myself"
4.0,Didn't care for the color
4.0,"I sent this set to a friend for their gender reveal party.  It's a beautiful set,  lovely pattern.  I only wish it came with a pin."
4.0,This top is only held by a wedding dress style button at the top and the strap. The top was a little small and very difficult to get off. The button ripped off when I tried to take the top off. But other than that the top is super cute and comfortable.
4.0,"Great hat for the price! While the rim is a bit creased from shipping it starts to stay in a normal shape after awhile . The pony tail hole was definitely an amazing feature, and was why I decided to purchase this hat . Used the hat for an archaeology program during the summer it not only helped keep my face shaded, but I could keep cool due to the pony tail capabilities. Will definitely continue to use it."
4.0,"Light and flowy, nicely lined, the dress looks cute worn backwards with the X in the front as well. I have two, navy and pink. the navy straps broke pretty easily when I accidentally pulled too hard on the dress trying to get up.  The pink one the straps are loose so when you wear either way they sort of sag a bit. The fit is not as good as the other, but its workable."
4.0,Two layers of fabric. No uncomfortable nose piece. The two layers are not too hot the breathe through. Tie dye pattern was nice.  Ran a little big for my face...
4.0,Its fiits nice but u need to be careful no to catch on something. But its nice fit
4.0,The top is crazy cute! I got a small and it fit my torso well but the sleeves weren’t long enough. They say wat least 1.5 inches below my wrist. Other than that it was great
4.0,"This is a nice bag. It’s very sturdy. Larger than I anticipated but works well when you only have a little in it too. If you’re one of the people that carries a small suitcase for a purse this probably isn’t going to be big enough for you but my typical purse only carries my credit cards, coin purse, and phone. This is quite a big larger than that. I could put the ipad in or a book.<br /><br />Four stars instead of five because of the color. I got the bright pink. It’s a nice color. However, the lining is dark and you can see it through the purse. It makes the purse look a little dingy.<br /><br />I received this item at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. This review is based on my own experience with the product. All of these opinions are my own and have not been influenced, modified, or edited in any way by the vendor. I do not promise a good star rating in return, nor am I affiliated with this company."
4.0,"Great material but would fit a man much better. I do lots of work reaching into tight spaces and I am notorious for bruising my arms or scraping them, this is a great product but is too big on my arms but fit my husband perfectly."
4.0,"I got these for my husband and we love them! The only thing is the red one looks like it is red and black, but is really red, black, and purple."
4.0,"I didn't especially care for the kinda rubbery/pliable frames and they didn't work well with my particular eyeglasses, which are reading glasses. I was going to get my 8 bucks back when my son absconded with them.  This is a good thing.  He's been using them too--at least while on his xbox, and they happen to look really good on him, which doesn't matter but btw.  Why?  Because he wants to protect his retinas, that's what he said.  In his Speech class a student picked the topic of blue light for his topic; I don't know what grade the professor gave him but he gets an A from me for making my usually cynical son mindful about what hours in front of a monitor can do to ones' eyes.  I'm glad these worked out for him because it costs about $150 to get your prescription glasses coated.  If anything, I'd like to know exactly which coatings they've used here. (Update: Seller answered that they use crystal sapphire which I believe is the latest tech.) They seem well-made and are very comfortable to wear as they weigh nothing.  The lense coating is even and there are no irregularities in the 'glass.' So, basically my review is based on that a 20 yo grabbed these from me and is wearing them; I honestly think that says something about this product so I'll leave it at that.<br /><br />I got these at a discount for my review."
4.0,Would have liked it to be a bit larger so that you could see the detail better.
4.0,I am 5.2 and about 127.  I purchased the #2 Champagne.  I have bought many items from Asia and know that they say to order one size up.  I am usually in between a large and a medium in these cloths (US Medium).  So I bought the medium. Nope to small. The arms were very tight.  I reordered the large.  The large is a bit bigger but not much so read the measurements.  It fits me perfectly!  The material is smooth and should be great in the rain.  You will need to cut the button holes.  The black piece by the lapel is only on one side.  It does have pockets.  Great purchase.
4.0,I love the style and how it hugs your body in all the right places. Runs somewhat small but after reading the reviews on here I ordered one size larger than what I normally wear. I'm 5'4 and weigh 150 and got sz large. I'm giving a 4 star simply because the fabric is kinda thin and see-thru if you don't wear dark underwear and bra.
4.0,I was hoping it would be a little longer but it is comfy
4.0,Nice dress. I have worn it to the Carribian and in the summer at picnics.
4.0,"Great shape, form factor, quality of material."
4.0,Cute purse.  Very stiff.  It is definitely not real leather.  The pic is true to the color.
4.0,Exactly what I ordered. Nice change of pace in color variety.
4.0,"I ordered these shoes and found they were a little narrow for my feet, but wearing thinner socks solves the problem. Comfortable and really durable. Love them"
4.0,"The print is gorgeous but it was way too big. It is one size fits all but it was noticeably too large. Unless I wore a belt, looked a but ridiculous."
4.0,Haven't used these yet but my hubby and I travel frequently.  They will definitely come in handy.  Just wish i had one that was much bigger instead of so many small ones
4.0,Very happy with the product. The only problem was upon opening the package it the smelled awful.  I almost returned it. After a wash the smell was gone. My 3 year old loves it. Much easier to wear then a scarf.
4.0,"This dress was super comfy, hides everything!! I ordered a large and was too big, so ordered a medium. Could of went with a small. I'm usually an XL, problem area is my stomach. 5'1 and dress would sometimes would get caught up I'm my sandle. Other than that would definitely order again. Blue is true to color (Roayal Blue)"
4.0,Soft I liked. Shorts too small matching tee top
4.0,Pretty okay. Fits a little too snug but e fore’s it to work lol. We’d buy larger next time
4.0,i ordered 2 Large jackets. they are bigger/roomier than expected which is great. material is also heavier than expected. not too practical for a light wgt jacket & more for colder weather
4.0,I gave it 4 stars because they run smaller than  the size should
4.0,"I liked the style and the fabric but the color was not what I wanted.  I thought it would be a beige colored dress like in the picture , but it was more peach toned, which didn’t work with my complexion.  I had to return it because of the color.  If it was white, or a true khaki beige, I would love it."
4.0,A beautiful surprise for the price. Very pretty and washes well. 1 star off<br />because theirs not an internal tie
4.0,"Smaller than expected, but good material and super cute pattern."
4.0,"I mean it's as pictured. Seems sturdy, the chrome is a little prone to scratch from beyond in your pocket and the only reason I dock a star. It's etched, though, so still perfectly fine looking. Wish it was a little larger TBH"
4.0,great buy they work
4.0,Very cute I would have loved some breast support but regardless its really cute
4.0,Nice!!! It was a great fit. I would recommend this. It's a loose fit.
4.0,It is bigger and heavier than expected but overall it is good for special occasions.
4.0,"I'm 6'2"", 210lbs., athletically built, with a 46"" chest and a 36"" waist.  I ordered an XL, and it fit perfect.  If I was any bigger than my dimensions, it would have been too tight.  With that being said, it feels good in the shoulders, and no movement issues.  It's very much like chain leather store leather leather jacket, not the heavier distressed leather I was hoping for, but the lighter leather as mentioned.  Not as distressed as eluded to in the ad description, but ok.  It's comparable to what you'd get in a store in the US as defined in my comments."
4.0,They are a great fit. I'm a 14/16 and the L/XL was perfect fit. They aren't see through which made me so happy. My only complaint is that as soon as I put them on my wedding ring snagged on it good. I mean they snag VERY easily and it's a permanent thread sticking out now. I am not happy about that.
4.0,Great value. Only wish is that they had some adjustability.
4.0,"love this.  The fabric and print are awesome. However, it's definitely a juniors sizing (which, I guess as it's advertized, is accurate).  I usually wear small/medium in juniors, and although it still fits me, it's small in the shoulders and doesn't have enough length as a nightgown unless you are somewhere in the range of 5'2 or shorter I would imagine."
4.0,I was hoping for a variety but got 3 of one kind 2 others that were the same and 3 different ones thankfully I got one that I actually like. I was really wanting a stitch one but got 3 black dumb looking ones :( wish there was an option to pick which ones you wanted because 5 of them are for like very young children I'm a grown woman and my kids won't use those ones either.
4.0,"Nice looking band that is a good fit on more dressy watches. Definitely too short for large man’s wrist, but great for small to average. Comes with extra spring pins and installation tool. Soft and comfortable, nice upgrade from factory bands in many mid-price watches."
4.0,"I thought they were adorable, but way, way small. I went by the size chart, however, I think they need to actually take the time and measure them again."
4.0,"Maybe its just my ears, but I am always worried about losing these gorgeous earrings!"
4.0,Didn't work for me....
4.0,Just what I imagined it would gonna be
4.0,"These leggings are great, for the price. They're super comfortable, come in a variety of fashionable colors / prints, and they make your butt look good. The material is soft to the touch, but is quite sheer, and pills and snags easily. I personally would not work out in these leggings because of how thin the material is. But they're great for lounging around the house or running errands! I bought two pairs (leopard and snake) and I am happy with my purchase."
4.0,Pretty. Great price!
4.0,Darling but to small. Need to return two of them.
4.0,...more padding
4.0,"Got these because my original piercing was beginning to hurt at 27 weeks pregnant. Cleaned area and maternity ring before putting it in, from first glance it is very flexible and colors are vibrant. I am hoping they last. They are very comfortable, I forgot I was even wearing one after just a few hours of having these in. Would reccomend overall."
4.0,"Soft material. Flows very nicely. Wish the skirt was a little shorter but perfect knee length. If you are large in the chest area, it loses a but of color when stretched. Overall, belly minimizing & awesome!"
4.0,"It is what it says it is, Very cool and complimented often."
4.0,I like this cross necklace but was hoping the chain was a bit larger. I would recommend it to others
4.0,"Like this,band quite a bit and love that it looks so much more like a watch band. The only drawback is it is quite large. I had remove to all the links possible before it fit. Someone with a more petite frame may find this to large."
4.0,"These earrings are really cute, and the price is right! My only complaint is that the post of one of them bent the first time I went to put them on. The posts aren't too sturdy, so go easy on them."
4.0,Got for golf outing joke easy and cheap
4.0,"I first want to say that these lederhosen are exactly as advertised. Everything from pricing to sizing advise is accurate. However, now I would like to mention some things not advertised. I would like to note that these aren't slams or anything, just observations. Additionally for the price I'm really not surprised, and to be honest for the price this product isn't bad.<br /><br />1) the pants are cow suede as advertised and I'm sure it might have been high quality at some point, but it's stretched very thin. In areas the leather is traditionally thick it has been reinforce with a low quality canvas.<br /><br />This is actually clever because I'm sure this is what allowed for the embroidery. Still it's cheap vs traditional.<br /><br />2) the insides are lined with this satin material which is a first for me. I've never seen it done but it's a fun touch and comfortable. However, the nice satin lining ends 2 inchs before the end of the shorts and is replaced by this scratchy mesh. You don't really notice it much but it is there.<br /><br />Given how thin the leather is I'm assuming this feature was add to prevent too much friction and reduce wear and tear. On all though I would say this is actually a bonus though.<br /><br />3) nothing wrong with these shorts but just an FYI to men with a good sized behind these do fit a bit snug around the hips. Waist is great but the hips are a little snug. Once again this should only apply to guys who squat a lot.<br /><br />4) This is another FYI, cow leather/suede isn't actually all that common in Germany. It's more of a recent cheap substitute for those who want to get really traditional. Goat leather is most often used and if you have the money deer leather is the most traditional. I saw this company does have goat leather options and it would be awesome if they extended some of these designs to goat leather.<br /><br />5) I noted earlier that for the price this isn't bad and I want to follow up on that by saying real traditional lederhosen are for basic shorts $200-250 and for high quality shorts $250-500. So the fact that these really do the trick for half the price is pretty great. If you're young and want a pair, you really can't lose here. If you're older and want that one time high quality buy then I wouldn't add this to your cart."
4.0,"Great , I love it."
4.0,Worked great on our vacation.
4.0,This mask is great for less than 3 hour use. It is very responsive to your voice. The battery runs out in about an hour after a 6 hour charge. It is comfortable even though the led panel is not very flexible and the pocket sown into the mask is a bit tight to place it back after washing.
4.0,"I love simple tips I can wear with leggings to work. The pockets are awkward, though. The material is too thick so they appear chunky."
4.0,Got this as an extra watch to leave at work in case I forget to put mine on.  It does work which is all I am asking for it to do.  Took 3 weeks to get here in a small bubbled envelope which I  didnt expect it any other way.
4.0,The only thing I didn’t like about the dress is the skirt opening is too big. I have to be careful when I am sitting because otherwise I will be too exposed.
4.0,Very nice holiday tunic but with extremely clingy even with a slip underneath. Just something to be aware of when ordering.
4.0,"I was surprised by the material as I thought it wasn't going to have any give to it but was very happy it did.  I am 5'7"" size 20 and ordered the largest size available (2xl) and while it did fit it was just barely."
4.0,"It is a very soft, warm nightgown.  The small size is what I'd consider a medium but very comfortable.  The only criticism I have is the  thick seam down the middle of the back of the gown.  The nightgown has regular side seams so why did they add the thicker one in the back?  Unfortunately, you can't help but be aware of it.  If not for that seam it would be a 5 star review."
4.0,Size seems to run small
4.0,"I liked these pants and thought they were good quality. I bought them to wear for bicycle commuting, but the legs are just too wide for cycling. Had to return them. I wish they would make them with a slimmer pant leg."
4.0,I would have given it 5 stars if the jacket wasn't so small . It has absolutely no stretch . Thankfully i ordered a size up and was still wearable ! The jacket itself is GORGEOUS . Very vibrant and the romper underneath is velvet and VERY flattering . I will definitely wear this to go out ! Thanks !!
4.0,"I bought two packs of these so I wouldn't have to wash them as often.  I have a big head (7-7/8) and they are a little snug, but that's OK.  Very absorbent and they wash well (in cold water & air dry).  I live in Florida (Hot!) and these have made my outside time much more comfortable."
4.0,"Love the detail on the back, but structure wise in the front its lacking.. Fits odd.."
4.0,"material is a good but a lot lighter than pictured,"
4.0,some what large but very good
4.0,I only gave 4 stars because the color is nowhere near as bright as pictured. The color is more dull. Other than that it fit fine and the quality is ok.
4.0,"These goggles are comfortable and well sealed, and they look cool too :)  My only complaint is that after i wore them the first time, there were water spots in them that would not come out, no matter how I polished them inside and out. Seems like that shouldn't be an issue, and it's a little distracting, until you get in the water. I'll continue to use them, but wish they were as crystal clear as when they were brand new!"
4.0,"First off I did want to mention that I do not see how you can use this as a nose piercing unless you use it for a septum piercing. It is good enough to use for a lip piercing but you will more than likely have to get the biggest size for it to work. For your ears, cartilage piercings you will need the medium-small sizing depending on how big your ears are. Since my ear is on the smaller size I need the smallest size for my ear. And my lips are fuller I need the biggest size for my lip. It is best to measure or go by what you own instead of guessing which might work for you. Since the little gems are screw on it is a bit hard to screw on. I used this for a few days with no issues, no irritation and works great for what I needed.<br /><br />**I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review**"
4.0,Nice lightweight mask.  Was great for Halloween.  Eye holes need to be bigger though especially with fake lashes on.  It was hard to position it so that I could blink and not hit the edge of the mask.
4.0,"This sweater is cute.  It is a little boxy.  I got a small and it is huge.  It looks and feels like it will stretch out/loose shape easily, but I think it will last for the one season.  The sleeves are cute rolled."
4.0,"These are the most comfortable summer socks, smooth, light weight, and comfortable!  Fit well for walking shoes and sandals. I would recommend them to friends. There is only one thing they could have done better, provide more color choices."
4.0,Is exactly like the picture! I liked it
4.0,"They're pretty, but the color isn't the same as on the picture. They're much lighter and that disappointed me."
4.0,"Pretty decent slippers, fit true to size and pretty comfy. I use them as indoor shoes"
4.0,La tela muy bonita y nada trasparente
4.0,These are cute. I just wish the seams were on the side and not right in the middle of the crotch.
4.0,Pros:<br />As discribed<br />Desent over all quality<br />Nice dust cover for visor<br />Fits nicely over a helmet<br />Great for airsoft<br /><br />Cons:<br />Kinda cheap material<br />Feels a little flimsy<br />Reminds you it’s airsoft quality
4.0,"the glasses definitely make you look funny, for me they don't really help with anything except for people having their brights on. it helps make it easier to see when the light is glaring into your eyes."
4.0,These cases were delivered quickly and were reasonably priced. I do wish they were a little more sturdy.
4.0,Great value nice coat
4.0,"It is a little heavy because the battery packages is built on the left side. I recommended that they should build on both size to balance bothside.<br />In the club, even when you try to switch the loud sensor, it still light up all the way.<br />I understand the affordable price will get what u get."
4.0,They were comfortable enough but the very bottom of the legs were tightish.
4.0,"My wife likes these as good-quality wool socks.  Yes, they're only 53% wool, but that allows them to be a lot easier to clean without shrinkage, and have a little elasticity to them, so she doesn't mind one bit.  They are a little smaller than you might expect, but they have a little stretch to them, and they'll work just as well with sneakers as they will with hiking boots.  And they'll keep you warm."
4.0,PJ bottoms... good fit... nice quality flannel.
4.0,"It came in quite early than I expected. The skirt fits very well and so was the top. I like how there's buttons and zippers in order to put them on. Overall, it's really cute. But the I like the skirt to be around my waist but thats okay, at least it's not short.<br />Size Large:<br />5'3<br />Chest size 36B<br />Waist size 26&#34;<br />Hip size 37&#34;<br />And I weight 125 lbs<br />Caution:<br />The shirt isn't stretchy but it has some room. I usually get the medium but I knew the top would be too small"
4.0,Only had to adjust sleeve length.
4.0,Love it.  The quality is nice but I wish the chain was a little longer. My husband has a big neck
4.0,My son's bought it for me since I'm a firefighter
4.0,So cute!! Great as a shower gift for expectant mothers!
4.0,"I primarily use them for ath-leisure  (I work from home).  The quality is really good; they are heavyweight with a nice soft lining. They are very warm.  They also have pockets, which is very useful.<br /><br />They do run a little small, so I'd recommend ordering a size up."
4.0,Great Ring fits pretty well! I wish they would make more designs of this ring.
4.0,Just tad small through upper arms but not noticable.  Got lots of compliments first time I wore it.<br /><br />Shipping was fast.
4.0,"I like the look of these sweat pants, very sporty! However, the material feels a little stiff."
4.0,I like the looks of this watch. The dial is big. The strap is very attractive but time will tell how it will hold up as a work watch. The price was good.
4.0,The dress was really cute! I wore it to a friends wedding & got lots of compliments . Really hate that it snagged the first day I wore it. Really cute though-
4.0,I got this bracelet for Valentine's day from my husband and I love it! I just wish the beads were bigger!
4.0,Perfect for my second holes in ears
4.0,"I normally wear a size 14 (although sometimes can fit into a 12), and I ordered the Large in this dress. It fits perfectly. It's a little bit snug in the bust area and around my hips, but the middle is loose. The arm pits area of the dress fit nicely and do not gape. The fabric is thick but stretchy, like stretch denim. I ordered the white and it is not see-through. The length is perfect for wearing with leggings in the summer. The only thing that I was a little bit disappointed in was in how plain the white looked once I was wearing it, so I embellished it by sewing on two large black buttons on each of the front pockets, and I stitched on a single vertical black 1-inch wide ribbon down the front/center. Now it looks super cute!"
4.0,Very cute!  I purchased for a 7 lb newborn and it was too large.  Looking forward to when she grows into it.
4.0,"la unica falla que le puedo poner  en funcion al valor pagado,  es su  estuche  feo<br />el producto es perfecto"
4.0,Super comfy! I love it! It fits perfectly! The only thing is that it’s a little see through on the top especially if you are larger up top.
4.0,"the pant is OK.<br />The liner is not removable.<br />Material seems to be of good quality.  Zippers are good.<br />The length is OK when you stand up.  However, they get pulled up a lot when you sit on the bike.  I think the reason is that the bottom of the pant is too low, making the inseams too short.<br />For reference, I'm 5'5&#34; short, 155lbs, and order a medium normal and it barely cover by ankles when riding.  (I ordered a medium short from another vendor and had to return it because it's too short.)"
4.0,"I bought these as a gift. They had a really odd smell to them and I had to air them out a bit before wrapping them. They seemed a decent quality. I can't speak as to how well they bear up to washing etc, as they were given as a gift. But as babies grow quickly I don't see much sense in buying expensive clothes the first few months and these were reasonably priced. The only caveat was the strange chemical odor."
4.0,"Very cute swimsuit. I bought it for our vacation but it was on the larger size for my toddler. She is three, average size I purchased a size 2-3 Years."
4.0,"I actually purchased the dress in Gray, size S as a base for my Halloween costume. I expected it to be form fitting and it is, but it's actually very flattering on its own. The knit isn't too clingy, which I anticipated might be an issue considering the low price. I generally run smaller through the shoulders and bust, so I wasn't surprised that it fit a little loose in that area.<br />It's a great basic piece that could be dressed up or down depending on how you accessorize. I just might have to try it in black or red!"
4.0,Match the slide I purchased perfectly.  However wish the post was placed in the middle of the earring and not at an end.  Would rather they were horizontal o the ear instead of vertical.
4.0,"The fabric itself is very high quality.Ticker then I expected them to be. Good if you are in a cold environment , bad if you are in the desert like me. The fit is also smaller then my previous purchases of american brands in the same size , I suggest you go a size up . Would have preferred them being a little longer, my husband is 6'1 and it was short on him."
4.0,Loved it!! Kind of big!!!
4.0,This necklace is sturdy and well constructed. I wore it with my witch doctor costume and received a lot of compliments. A lot of costume jewelry can look cheap. Not the case with this necklace. I was very happy with it.
4.0,Nice shirt!  I wore it on Mother's Day and got compliments.  I wish it was an inch longer - otherwise perfect!
4.0,"The dress fits perfectly, the belt too small."
4.0,"Nice product, embroidery was well done. The only issue was the Rangers insignia on front was a little on the small side. Other than that very satisfied."
4.0,Does the job well. Only downside is it is all plastic and I broke the last one I had but it was after 3 years of regular use.
4.0,Looks great! I think Mimi is going to love it!
4.0,"Very large bag. Construction quality matches the prices, ok quality but not the best. The bag fills my need. I would purchase again but it could be made better. A seam was not stitched properly."
4.0,I had order a medium but it was to small so I send it back and order a larger one.<br />Nice sweter
4.0,They are comfy but very thin almost see through
4.0,"The bag itself looks great, the leather seems durable and the bag is very roomie. You could fit quite a bit in this. That being said, if you like pockets then you will not be a big fan of this bag. Does not have enough of them. Other bags from the same brand has more pockets. Due to this reason alone I returned it. If pockets aren't a big deal for you, there is nothing else that I could say that is ""wrong"" with the bag."
4.0,"The colors are beautiful.  Love the material, the top is tighter than the bottom. The bottom is wide and flowing. It’s a little to wide. But I love the color and the material so I’m keeping it!"
4.0,Love the fit but a few of the rings fell off
4.0,"No wire to fit nose, otherwise nice"
4.0,I really like these on extra cold days to layer.
4.0,i have been wearing the black one from the set and i have gotten plenty of compliments from people asking where did i get it. these would come in handy for stocking stuffers or just gifts for family .  so glad i bought these.
4.0,Runs large. Order down a size.
4.0,Nicw!
4.0,great price for a quality product. would order again
4.0,It was exactly what I was looking for.  Didn't want anything fancy something that works first time - every time.
4.0,It seems to be pretty decent. Looks just like an Apple Watch strap and goes on just like one. I like the perforations because I tend to sweat a lot in my work so this will help breath more. I feel that the brackets mounted to the watch seem like the weakest point on the assembly but only time will tell. Love the colors and can’t wait until the strap breaks in to match my heavily ‘loved’ Suunto watch!
4.0,This is my third cap from this manufacturer. The other two were great but this one has a crooked visor of about 1/4 of an inch more on one sode than the other with some stitching bunch up. The cammo helps hide the flaw but it is there. Overall a good cap if it weren't for that flaw.
4.0,I have no complaints this is doing exactly what is said it would do
4.0,"It was thinner and the central part smaller than I thought it would be, but that makes it even more delicate. If you like details and not to be flashy this is the one for you. It appears to be of quality<br /><br />Delivery: Arrived late, but in perfect conditions<br />It comes with a bag that is quite convenient if you want to give it to someone as a present"
4.0,Got this for my husband.  He loves it.  Overall it's wrinkle resistant.  It wrinkles a bit but not too bad. Got a couple more with other designs for him.
4.0,Cute and very comfortable. Glad I purchased this.
4.0,They were too small.
4.0,"1 more magazine pouch for the price than other more well know brands.  I did not receive the coyote tan I ordered but the black version turned into a happy mistake.  I use the cumberbund on its own for more edc under my buttoned shirt, no more bluky pockets."
4.0,I really like this dress. It is so easy to throw on and put coats or jackets over it to make it an outfit. The quality is pretty good.  It wasn't super thin but it was a thinner material. I am 5'9 and 150 lbs and I got a medium. It fit great!
4.0,Good dress and nice fitting.
4.0,"This is a lovely dress and fits like a glove.  I wear a size 18 and purchased the 3XL. I am an apple shape and while nothing I wear will hide my roundness, this dress does look flattering on me. The lace is beautiful and the buttons are sexy.  I would buy this dress again!"
4.0,"Fits as expected, colors are great"
4.0,"A few threads are fraying. Like another review said, it's kinda designed for smaller chests. I'm 5""11 and it comes to mid calf. I appreciate that the strap hardware is metal."
4.0,"she seems to like it, wish it was a little louder."
4.0,"I love them and they are a good dupe for Aerie Crossover Flares. But the band folds over constantly and they are a little short. Also something to note, they don’t flare out very much. I love that about them, I prefer that. But if you are looking for a big flare these won’t be it."
4.0,"These fit well & I love the stripe however taking them out of the package & holding them up, I could see through them. Also, piled after first wash."
4.0,My nieces liked them. The only negative was that the colors are bright and cannot be used in school setting as it is too distracting.
4.0,Very pretty chain. The color is really bright and the delivery was fast. The only bad comment I have is that it keep pulling my hair. Not a deal breaker but not pleasant.
4.0,"Fits in the shoulders and chest, small in the arms. If your a member of the gun show this won't work to well for you...unless you go 80's action star with it and tear off the sleeves. Classy and functional!"
4.0,"Nice sparkly nose ring. This isn't a dainty gem, it does stick out. The tip of the &#34;L&#34; is visible on the inside of the nose, if that makes sense."
4.0,Looks as advertised. Wish it was a little larger. Even comes with a cleaning cloth.
4.0,These look exactly as pictured but run very small.  I had to purchase the largest size for my 9yo.  They should be considered boys and not men sizes.
4.0,"These earrings are sweet.  They are small hoops, called huggies because they sit close to the ear lobe.  The hinge makes them easy to put on.  I expected the cubic zirconia to be a little more sparkly, but overall they look great and the small size makes them understated enough for everyday use."
4.0,"Bought it for my husband, as he dresses business casual to work everyday.  Great versatility in having both colors in one belt.  Nice packaging when the gift arrived."
4.0,"My kids love this, but it runs a little small. Next time, I'll get one size up. The strip is not tied enough. Otherwise we love it!"
4.0,The studs are cute but I was hoping I would be able to trim the chain to fit my nose. Still cute but a little loose
4.0,Very nice warm hat but had to return as it was big enough.
4.0,"So I love the way this looks on my spouse! And I am a firm believer in BeLuring products! I like the fact that the flowers are not a permanent part of this outfit because we felt it looked cuter off of it. Just a heads up it doesn't include the stocking do not come with this so that leaves your options up to customize this outfit! The only complaint that we have it the way the bra is, it not a built in bra but more of a sports bra. It looks good but would look even better if it hugged the breasts more! Overall we are very happy with our purchase!"
4.0,"Fits great, and fabric quality good for the price. I like it."
4.0,"Beautiful earrings. My only gripe is that they photograph more silver. Otherwise, lovely!"
4.0,"Update**** The company contacted me and there was a way to make the belt go down smaller so it now fits perfect! I always appreciate great customer service and this is a great product so I am changing my rating to give them more stars. I would suggest however, that they put an instruction book with it so this isn’t an issue for others :)<br /><br />I like feel and the thinness of the product because it is exactly what I was looking for, however the sizing is way off. It says it will fit a 25 inch waist, I am only a 36 inch waist and it is too large. It cannot be pulled any tighter. If it handy been for this, it would have been perfect."
4.0,They fit comfortably. The padding seemed a little off during the ride. It seemed like there was more padding towards the butt cheek area and I felt like there needed to be more padding in the crotch region. But overall they are pretty good and the sizing zeal accurate.<br /><br />I received this product on a promotional discount for my honest review and they are 100% my own opinions. I received no compensation for this review and I am not required to give a positive review. I am also not associated with the seller in any way
4.0,"I bought this to replace my ancient worn out wallet. I love the layout with several pockets for all my cards, as well as a big enough pocket to keep my checkbook (because I'm old school like that). I like that it can double as a small purse if I dont want to carry a larger bag. It even has a place out of the way to tuck the strap when I'm using it with a larger bag. After a few months of use, the only downside so far is that the faux leather is starting to separate where the individual card slots are. Sometimes I got to put a card away and I find myself catching the edge of the card between the layers of the ""leather."" I got it on sale, and its about on par with what I would expect for the discounted price."
4.0,"It is kind of bulky,but I like it"
4.0,The sickle is very cheaply made. The plastic is so thin and floppy.
4.0,"Well made, easy to wear rings."
4.0,Didn’t have a med size only large
4.0,Color/size were as expected...<br />the only thing is that the waist seemed a bit high... I am working on how to adjust!! Was a chaperone for a senior prom.... perfect for that occasion...
4.0,"Good dress - I have fat arms so it didn’t fit well there, but everywhere else it worked!"
4.0,They’re really nice but they’re so fragile and I’m afraid I might break them if I put them in too harshly ㅠㅠㅠㅠ
4.0,"The dress itself is nice but I didn't feel that it was appropriate enough for the wedding reception I wanted to wear it to. I am 5'4&#34;, ~140lbs, C-D cup, and I ordered a medium. The waist fit totally fine, but the top was too large. It may not look it in the pics, but the top part made it definitely unwearable"
4.0,Good for my son baseball game!
4.0,"I bought the M 6/8 wear an 8 and it fit perfectly.  The only thing, thought there was more red/maroon in the bottom of the skirt it is more brown, but I still wore it with maroon shoes...remember it doesn't have to match it, just has to go with it!"
4.0,Cute gift. Larger than expected.
4.0,Shirt looks great on my Grandson.<br />Fits perfectly.
4.0,Band fits perfect. Screwdriver tool broke on second screw. I had to use my own.
4.0,"These are really adorable and look great when they don't fall off. I've had trouble getting them to stay in place as they fall down throughout the day, but it's easy to secure them when it happens. As such, 4/5 start rating and I'd still recommend them to anyone looking for a new way to wear earrings."
4.0,"Great patterns, runs a little large, but my daughter is on the skinny side"
4.0,They are very pretty . Great  looking
4.0,"Nice dress, well made, I liked it, unfortunately I had to return it cause the torso part was too long and i didnt like how it fit me."
4.0,"Very soft, comfy and cute. Run a bit small, pay attention to sizing. Otherwise, they are great."
4.0,"Does exactly what it was made for. I love how it covers everything. I am 5ft4in at 145lbs and it fits me perfectly with room to spare (currently expecting). However, don't expect a high quality apron. It is of low quality but has not broken on me yet and I've had it for a month"
4.0,"My 3-year old loves this helmet and plays with it all the time. When it first arrived, we were able to adjust the straps to fit his head, but plastic connection pieces made for pressure points which he found uncomfortable. this was easily resolved by putting some duct tap and a piece of cloth in the top of the helmet and now he plays fireman all the time.  good price."
4.0,"I will say it was a little long and even big depending on how you're built. I am 5'3 1/2 and I weight 184ish 14/16, curvy but I am smaller in my arms and upper body and carry some weight in the middle. Other than that it was great! Soft material, kind of cotton with a little bit of stretch!"
4.0,Not horrible quality. Fits great. I have had genuine leather bands and this does not give that kind of feel. For the price. Definatly worth it. Looks good on your wrist
4.0,"Very good itms, I like"
4.0,"It’s loose I bought a small whereas I wear a M or L depending on the dress, but even as a size S it was way too loose for me. It’s a clingy material. I’ll have to gift it out to someone that probably wears an XL."
4.0,"Comfy and stay up, but the white is not really white— it’s more of an off white with tan/beige  undertones"
4.0,"But it was about one size large for a vest.  They should fit well/snug as they go under a blazer without bulging out, etc.  Gotta return and get one size smaller.  Got a small so it was marked and it wasn't much small than the medium.  I'm going to have to have it altered.  Caution, very large for sizing."
4.0,Nice quality. They’re bigger than I hoped for. I do not like socks that touch my ankle. Cute socks and nice material.
4.0,Product looks good. Though haven't work yet.
4.0,Cute flowing soft top with lace details and a top cut out. Fits well in the shoulders and flows in a flattering way. Super comfortable.
4.0,Like the quality and the size
4.0,"The dress is a little bit smaller than what I expected. I usually wear a small size in these kind of dresses but this one is slightly tight. The fabric is also not what I was expecting. It makes he dress look kind of cheap compared to what you see in the picture. However, the dress Is really pretty. I have received many compliments, my husband told me that it looks a lot better when you wear it"
4.0,I ordered both a small and a medium. Both look great but I am keeping both due to the fact the the small top fits me best and the medium bottoms work better.
4.0,I love the complementary colors. this purse is a good size but one of the draw strings has popped some stitches already.
4.0,"So cute, washes well. Straps are a little big, but doesn’t hinder the dress."
4.0,Teenager likes them. ..2 thumbs up!
4.0,"My size is usually between M and L. I’m a regular fit with a belly, so I bought the L. American sizes are usually larger than the european shirts I buy, so I wasn’t really surprised when this shirt was a bit too long and large for me. Luckily, I like to tuck the shirt in or use a woolen sweater underneath in the cold days of northern Norway :). But otherwise the size is just right, and if you are a regular fit medium, buy a medium, no more questions asked!"
4.0,"Over all I like the sweater, thank you"
4.0,Really cute sweatshirt. Bought my tall 10 yr old a woman's small and it for her with just a little room. It is definitely not big on her. Great bright colors and black is velvety.
4.0,Fun jersey. Not much more to say than that
4.0,"If you are looking for a high quality nose ring, these are not for you. If you are looking for pretty nose rings to change out for fun, these are for you. The part that goes through your nose is very thin."
4.0,"I like the dress - the fabric is fine, but the white collar and the white at the end of the sleeves was dirty....."
4.0,"It' a very nice top, I love it, too bad I have to return it. And honestly I wish I could give the reviewers a negative review for this one.<br />Before I purchased this top, I took my time and read through a large portion of the 100 or so reviews. Most of them all have the same denominators in common: 'This shirt runs small', 'It's so tiny',  'Order up', 'Order up two sizes for an accurate fit', I think one reviewer actually said it fit like a children's shirt. etc.<br />I normally wear a small, medium, or large depending on the cut/style of the shirt. So I picked my favorite color and ordered up as recommended; a XXL to allow for shrinkage in the dryer for that perfect fit.<br />I received the shirt in the mail and what do I discover when I open it? The shirt looks like it is 2 to 3 sizes too big! And do you know why? Because I ordered it 2 to 3 sizes too big. Here I was expecting this teeny, tiny, little shirt that was just going to fit. And instead I was nervous to stand near an open window for fear I might take flight around the room.<br />I should have just ordered a medium, or even a large, I think that would have fit perfectly.<br />Now, the funny thing is, I have to set up a return, print a label (waste more ink-- my sister has done enough of that already in my printer in the last two weeks--but I digress), repackage, drive to the UPS store, mail it, and wait for a return to be processed and the money re-credited to my account, and while I am waiting for all of that to happen, also wait for a medium or large to be available in the colors that I want, because they are currently out of stock.<br />And the even funnier thing?<br />They had my correct size, in the colors I wanted, when I ordered up this shirt a couple of sizes up based on these other reviews that said this shirt was basically for Barbie and Polly Pocket.<br />I want to know which shirt these people (the ones who said it was too small) tried on; I really do.<br />I did take off one star, because I wish the buttons were metal instead of plastic. I'm not really a fan of the antique, rubbed gold looking color on plastic. I guess I can change the buttons, I do have plenty of time before the new ones get here.<br />I'll let you know how take two works out."
4.0,I love this dress just wish it was a little longer. The fit was great.
4.0,Perfect over jeans
4.0,Everyone seems to think these are regular glasses I get a lot of compliments on these I use them for work and they’re so much better than the traditional googles very lightweight slip- free.
4.0,this dress is adorable on. i worry slightly that the button loops will break rather quickly
4.0,"First one I bought was a XL as I wanted to make sure it fit, was a little baggy on me but loved it regardless. Build quality wasn't the best it could be. However I bought a L recently and the stitching is so nice I dread ruining it."
4.0,There nice but way too big for a size 6. Lightweight and comfortable though.
4.0,"very good , litte small"
4.0,"Comfy, maybe runs on the smaller side, love the design,"
4.0,Really nice but I thought it might be a tad small and I was right so I ordered a 3T for my son that just turned 2. I love it!
4.0,"These are cute, and perfect for a little<br />Toddler. I ordered blue thinking they’d be cute on my son but they look super girly! Which is a shame bc I absolutely love the fit of the shoe. They are light weight, easy to get on/off, easy for him<br />To move in, and no stubbed toes! I use mine as play/mud shoes bc they are so girly lol. I’d definitely recommend these for girls"
4.0,I get tons of compliments. They are a little heavy for me but worth the compliments.
4.0,"This is really cute.  It is not too tight and fit as expected.  Also, I'm 5'8 and it was not too short, which was great as you never know when ordering online.  It did need a good ironing, which I suspect will be frequent.  But the material was nice and it really was not clingy at all, but still form flattering.  Very glad I ordered it."
4.0,"This is a gift, but it arrived in perfect condition and on time. Earrings look pretty and they appear to be the perfect size."
4.0,Bonito producto . Lo regalaré  con gusto y ya me comentaron q esta nice !  Por el precio muy bueno . La imagen si cumple su cometido.
4.0,The dress is so cute! Fit me just right.
4.0,Great fit. Print is thick and visible. Shirt is a bit thin to my liking but not paper thin.
4.0,"Everything fit great except the sleeves were tight,, especially since I ordered a size larger than I take."
4.0,"GREAT - Love the fabric--this polyester blend provides perfect weigjt for Summer wear.<br /><br />GOOD - color is okay but i would perfer lightet c9lors.<br /><br />SIZE - I would prefer a size larger and a bit longer, but 5hat is personal preference."
4.0,"I bought this rose gold metal band for my Samsung Gear Fit 2 Pro. It fits well on the pro. The package comes with a large length of links and a link removal tool, which is really easy to use. It took me less than 5 minutes to master and I had no idea what I was doing at first. I followed the instructional photo on the seller's page (the box does not come with instructions) and it worked out well. It took me about three tries to get the band size and location of the clasping mechanism correct for me. Overall the band looks good, it was very well wrapped in static cling foil, so no scratches upon arrival. I did notice that between links, though, there is some grey spotting. It's not easy to notice unless you remove the links, so I am not going to worry about it. The clasps were very easy to put onto my Gear Fit 2 Pro, unlike the original band clasps. Seems like a sturdy band that won't fall off and get lost, so I am keeping it. It's a bit too chunky for me, but it still looks good."
4.0,"Great quality product, it did run a little bigger than your typical large tshirt.  Nice material, and very comfortable."
4.0,I normally wear a large or medium in activewear. I ordered a large and they were very short and small.
4.0,"It fits well. It doesn't hurt though it is a tiny tiny bit small. If you have tall ears rather than the average, I wouldn't. Risk ordering this. The product arrived within 4 days, so great shipping. I love it, its cute, gives that fantasy look<br /><br />UPDATE;<br /><br />What I should've said is that for the adverage ear, this a small, its not gonna fit right, unless your ears are SMALLER than the adverage. I gave this  a 4 star but it deserves a 3 star."
4.0,It's a real pain to replace this kind of a band. I would have given 5 stars except for that.
4.0,It was a little too big because I ordered a size up (I was scared it did not go off US sizes) but it is fixable and easy to adjust. Nothing wrong with going up a size just in case. The only problem I had with it was the star pin. It fell off immediately and was not strong enough to hold. The glue was no good. I mean that’s fixable too but it was super disappointing.
4.0,Nice for lounging
4.0,Fun to wear and it's a nice accent to a vest. No issues. Needs to be wound once a day
4.0,Nice earrings! Large and noticeable
4.0,The glasses showed up in appropriate size packages with no damage. The quality of the glasses for the price they are is great!
4.0,The tie and matching square and cufflinks are really nice to look at and definitely attract the right kind of attention. But one thread is already sticking out from mine from the package which was disappointing. Depends what you use it for but overall pretty worth it
4.0,Fits on the small side.
4.0,arrived just as i got a heavy duty raincoat from work. someone stole the raincoat from my car so i had to resort to this one from Coofandy.  It is ultra-light and fits me well over another coat or thick sweater - 6&#34;1' 210 lbs. comes with a packing pouch. when i get my work jacket back i will use this one for mountaineer backbacking.  it must weigh no more than 1 ounce.<br /><br />Revised 03/01/17 -<br />Item is not 100% waterproof. Took a walk in the rain and it did start to let moisture through after 10 minutes.
4.0,"Fits my waist size 34&#34; perfectly with jeans. I did not have to trim it. Kind of awkward to open a bottle of beer with the buckle, but it works. You have to be careful that you don't spill in a bad spot!"
4.0,The silver does tarnish quickly.
4.0,"Fun, but the finger band is very tight. Even for my 4 year old son (average size child). About 4 duds in pack and a coupe of dim ones."
4.0,Not really red white and blue more like a pink which I love pink so I won't wear for the 4th of july but will wear with other outfits
4.0,Runs a very small. I usually wear medium and I had to exchange for an XL for it to fit like pictured on the model.
4.0,"This fits perfectly and is very comfortable.  Just a side note for the black top with black floral bottom - the black material on the bottom part of the dress with the flowers is a different material than the black top and is a more faded color of black, so they don't exactly match.  If you don't mind that, then this dress is great."
4.0,"I like the weight of this watch. Similar in weight to my Invicta automatics. Not a screw down crown, so I won't be swimming or bathing with it on. The bezel has some play that I wish wasn't there. I don't care for the style of the bracelet. I will be changing that soon. Being a Citizen brand watch, I know it will serve me well for a long time to come."
4.0,These look amazing in my rootbeer monster pups.  The quality is perfect and the shipping was fast.  The only difference I noticed is the original lenses were much thicker causing these new ones to move a bit.  Other than that they revived my old shades with a fresh look at a great price.
4.0,I love this bag! However I don't think it's leather
4.0,"It's a very pretty dress and but it runs big, I got a medium because that's my everyday dress size and when I recieved this product it was big, so I had to adjust it from the shoulders and waist and I cut from the bottom of the dress because it was long for my taste I'm 5'0 feet but overall it's a pretty dress"
4.0,adorable love
4.0,I love how danty this necklace is! So pretty too!
4.0,"It's unfortunate that they used a cheap zipper on this sweatshirt, because everything else about it is slightly better than I expected.  It is really soft, fits my 6'2&#34;, 185lb. frame just right, and has piping where the shoulders meet the arms, showing how cleanly it is cut and making it look a grade up.  The sleeves are snug at first, which is a good thing, as they will inevitably get looser over time.  It is a simple sweatshirt, done pretty nicely, but the zipper doesn't love to work super smoothly.  Of course, you can use it as a pullover if the zipper ever gets stuck or stops working completely (as long as it fails closed, not open)."
4.0,"I bought the smallest size but they were still too long I had to knot them and hide the knot under the tongue, causing it to stick out a bit"
4.0,These turned out great for my wedding.
4.0,I likes this product.<br />The rings came in a timely manner and they fit perfectly. We both love our rings very much. The only thing is that the lettering is very small and i wish there was a way to order the ring in black for the women but other than it this is an awesome pair of rings.
4.0,If you like toe rings you will love these. Nicely made.
4.0,Looks cute and has been pretty durable.
4.0,"These are short and it seems like every time I wash them, the bottom rolls up even more and they get even shorter. I just wear them around my house on hot days, though, and make sure noone but my family sees me, so it's not the biggest deal. I normally wear a large in shorts and these size large fit fine, though I could stand for the waist to be a tiny bit looser. There's a drawstring on the waist if it happens to be too loose for you. They're comfortable and soft. There are no pockets on the sides, but there is one on the backside.<br /><br />Overall, these are short, but comfortable."
4.0,I bought the same one years ago off Lands End and lost it. Was happy to find it on Amazon. It fit my slim boy well though we size down even though he’s average height. The colors are very vibrant!
4.0,"Very pretty and sparkly! I love all the colors in it. My only thing is that it's a tad heavy, so it sags a bit. But, oh well, there are specials earring backs that can fix that. Too pretty not to wear. : )"
4.0,Nice shoe my only observation is that the shoe is not MADE IN ITALY as described here but made in Romania.
4.0,Love the style and I get alot of compliments. How ever they run small. I would order up at least 1/2 a size or even a whole size up.
4.0,A little bigger than I expected. But great quality.
4.0,"Love the material, they feel great but wish they were larger"
4.0,Very cool bracelet! Nice quality & like that it's adjustable.
4.0,Material is a bit thin which is good since I will be wearing them in hot weather.
4.0,Such a cute little outfit and it fits perfectly!
4.0,It was me very well and it fits me as well as the expected love her body is so big disproportionate and sometimes t-shirts or a little bit weird this one fits me just right just as I expected would definitely recommend it
4.0,My 21 month old is around 31 lbs and it fit perfect with a swimming dipper on .. good fit and top gives good sun protection. Have fun
4.0,"I normally cannot stand panty hose, but these were very comfortable and breathable. The package itself was damaged but the product seems to be just fine. I received three pair in mine, which is what the package states. They didn't look like they would fit when I took them out of the package but they stretch nicely and return to their shape instead of being stretched out. They aren't too dark, but I have noticed that when you're putting them on, if you're not careful, you may get a run or the start of a run depending on how rough you are. I pulled them pretty hard and never got a run but I noticed that a few of the threads in that area were slightly stretched.<br /><br />Overall, I think these are a great pair of panty hose for the price."
4.0,Comes back a little too far in the back but otherwise fits as expected
4.0,"I am busty, I ordered a size up to accommodate heavy clothing (oversize sweaters, hoodies, layers, etc). I am pleased. If you have long arms, you'll be disappointed, as mine are short and the sleeves fit well. Very warm. My only real complaint is the lining. It's ""cheap feeling"". It works though, even in the cold wind (first winter weather advisory type weather was no match)."
4.0,"The color of the dresses looked fades, so don't expect it to look as red or green oked lime green and a red dress which looked orange. I still liked the dresses. I plan to duy more colors. I also received alot of complements on these dresses."
4.0,The dress is very nice. Beautiful pink color.
4.0,"This case is WAY bigger than I expected, but it’s high quality, so I give it 4 stars."
4.0,"This little dress is awesome! I was scared it would be too short because I have a big bum, so I ordered up a size and it’ll work. I typically wear a large/xl or 12/14 and went with the xl in this dress. I wish I could’ve done a large for a more fitted waist, but the length would’ve been too short if I sized down. The fabric is a good thickness and has enough stretch that I didn’t have to undo the zipper. It’s roomier in the waist than I’d like, but that’s okay because it’s comfortable and the folds for the pockets hide my tummy. Overall a great quality dress for the price point and I will be wearing it to a wedding with some red shoes!"
4.0,This is a nice watch for the price.  I actually use it scuba diving and it is easy to read underwater and at night.
4.0,A little shorter than what I was expecting but the material is soft and looks like the picture.
4.0,They are higher quality than I've purchased at retail stores but quite tight. I'm small build and 32  bust; I've been trying to stretch them out
4.0,a little too expensive. I have not washed them yet I'll see if they will shrink.
4.0,"This shirt is perfect for fall, material is not to<br />heavy or bulky…..love all the color combinations."
4.0,Bought these for our grandson.  He hasn't quite grown into them yet so I don't know how well they will stay on or hold up but they seem to be made of  good quality materials and well constructed.
4.0,"Love that they stretch so well and look like we should be able to get lots of wear out of them. My issue is that the ""mustard"" has more of a grean-ish tint to it so it clashes with the true mustard sweater I was trying to match it with. Over all, definitely worth the money and I would love to get in more colors!"
4.0,Quality made and super warm. Only complaint is the pocket has a small opening and it’s hard to get my phone in and out! Got a larger size for me to allow for a looser fit.
4.0,The outfit is REALLY cute. BUT I really wish we could buy the shirt and pants in different sizes. I'm plus size but have a little waist. So the pants were to big and the shirt was almost to small.
4.0,"Fits as expected, soft, very flattering."
4.0,"Nice, but I would have preferred a finer chain."
4.0,"We all know the web-site photos of tritium watch-face markers are always exaggerated, right?<br /><br />Of course, but here's what is so disappointing about this special edition ""Red, White, and Blue"" Traser:  You can barely see the red markers at all!  It sort of makes sense, I guess.  Anyone who's educated themselves about tritium knows that green, white, orange and yellow are the brightest colors while red is probably the dimmest, and the others are in between.  (Not to mention that you can use it to harness ""the power of the sun in the palm of my hand."")<br /><br />To me, it would have made sense if the company had used T100 markers for the red along with the T25 markers they used for blue and white so that they would all have seemed to be similarly bright.  What a splash this product would have been with that minor change!  (And with a truly anti-reflective coating on the crystal...)<br /><br />The above said, the Traser Shade is a very attractive watch for daytime use.  Something about the light-colored hands on the black face just makes it stand out in normal light, and it's so easy to see the time immediately.  Along with that, the white-on-black lettering on the day and date indicators is also very readable in normal light.<br /><br />I ditched the NATO armband and obtained a beautiful black mesh bracelet for this watch, and it really does look sharp, so I use it for my normal work now, then ditch it at night for a regular T100 tritium watch.  To tell the truth, I have no idea why they even use T25 tubes anymore when T100 is available now, and I did not have to pay any more for it on a similar brand.  (No, not Isobrite...)<br /><br />UPDATE:  I took a picture of the face in the dark and I’m uploading it…  Perhaps there’s something wrong with my eyes!<br /><br />SUMMARY:  You'll like this watch, but (for me) the imbalance with the dim red markers is really distracting and a bit irritating."
4.0,"Very thin material, but my husband loves them!"
4.0,Really good sunglasses for the prize
4.0,"I bought these rings for my husband for Christmas because he wears silicone rings to work and has been wanting new ones. When I got them I was a little disappointed. I expected them to be a little more shiny/silvery/metal looking (I do not know how to explain the look. haha) but they were completely black (aside from the color part) and you can't really see the carbon fiber look that they are supposed to have. But he loved them. I also ordered a size 10 and they were to big so I sent them in for an exchange for a 9, and they sent me a 10 again. So since I can't exchange them again I had to send them back and wait for a refund so I could reorder them in the right size. So other than the hassle of getting the right size and the look not being as vivid as the pictures, my husband loves them and can't wait to get them and start wearing them!"
4.0,"Great little watch, emphasis on little. Even on my 6.75 inch wrists it looks small, but I'm typically wearing 38 and 39mm watches. The movement is the legendary NH35, which needs no introduction, these work horses just work. Out of the box I've run +2 to +10 spd. On days the watch is off the wrist it runs closer to the +10, on the wrist more like +2 for my particular sample, but the watch is somewhat position dependent for accuracy.  With white dial its a split second to read the time, one of the most legible I've seen and the only way to make it better would be increase the size. I thought the strap was pretty stiff but overall not bad, I did end up with a silicon rubber strap which I think fits a little nicer than the nato which makes the watch stand off the wrist. Overall impressed how light and comfortable this is, hope this will be my weekender for the foreseeable future."
4.0,"If you are into the classic aviator sunglasses look, these are great.  Lightweight, look good (I have the black ones).  Comes with a case and a cloth.  Case is nice enough, but it has a magnetic closure which is not that great.  You can find cheaper aviator frames out there, but they probably won't last as long; these seem more durable than the budget frames I have bought in the past."
4.0,"LOVE THESE PANTS...  One of the challenges I have is finding pants that fit my rear end.  For american sweats and and that type I normally wear XXL, I ordered XXXL for these and they're perfect.  I can move, bend, lift my leg all with no tightness.  Material and stitching is good, we'll see how it holds up.  I'll update it later after wearing for a bit..."
4.0,Great dress its not to tight but still looks great on comfortable
4.0,Fabric is lightweight without being see through. Very comfortable and easy to dress up or down.
4.0,As described and arrived quickly
4.0,They are lightweight and work well. The clip-on mechanism is a bit bulky but getting used to it. Would recommend.
4.0,"A little wide however, and skimpy on the length.  But hey, the baby is 1 - 1/2.  No one expects a baby that age to be a fashion model."
4.0,I have a full head of curly hair and this worked pretty darn good to turn me into a bald dude for Halloween at work. At least as good as it gets
4.0,The fit & quality are great.  The print I received was not as pictured.  Mine turned out to be mostly white backdrop with teal & a  navy blue.  It is okay I like it but the one on the model with the lavender & light blue was more what I was expecting.  I think I will order it again in a solid.  I really like the material & style.
4.0,"Good, but the strap was thinner than I expected."
4.0,"These are pretty decent, the lace is cute and they don’t obviously look like “period underwear,” but the waistband is pretty tight. Sizing is always hard online, but even after closely checking the size guide these were still too small. My hips are 36” and I got a small. Wish I had gone two sizes up tbh."
4.0,Thin material but great product
4.0,You get 3 of these belts for just $18. They are very comfortable and work very well. I like that they are adjustable so you can make them work for you just like any other belt really so if you know you had a healthy meal these will still work for you. I like that they have a easy quick release to allow to open them quickly which is a nice convenience. I find these to be quite comfortable and they work very well. They seem very durable but only time will tell.
4.0,"Online it looks to match the earrings and pendant, but the bracelet is silver with a gold &#34;O&#34; in God.  The necklace and earrings are gold with rhinestones for the &#34;O.&#34;  Some of the gold &#34;O's&#34; are marred, but not badly enough for me to return it.  The bracelet is 7 1/2&#34; long, and is a bit big for my tiny wrists."
4.0,"It's a great piece for the money but it sticks out a lot. That's my fault for not looking at measurements before buying, but I don't see how this would sit correctly on anyone. Take a dime, press the rim to your stomach and see how much that sits out... That's what this does. BUT, it is comfortable, it just lays sideways under my clothes, and it's cute enough to make me wear it anyways. Just a matter of preference I'm sure."
4.0,"I love the way these fit, while they are baggy they still look good on and didn't seem so wide in the legs which makes a difference. So the material is nice and not see through just the picture you can see the trees etc in them when I got them home they look like that. It wasn't until my son mentioned from a distance they looked like camouflage, then that's all I could see. It's not a big deal and I'm keeping them.<br /><br />I washed and dried them right away and they handled both well. The material does soften up when you wash them."
4.0,Super convenient. Plastic ring is not as soft as expected.
4.0,"Love the look and feel of this hat. Very lightweight, perfect for a summer wedding. The price is right, also. However, I have a smallish head so it is a big too large. I am going to surprise my (thick headed lol) sister with it, as I sadly had to purchase a different cloche hat (at an antique mall). I recommend if you have a normal- sized head!"
4.0,Bought them for a costume but wanted something I can wear all summer too. Very comfortable
4.0,Very comfortable & the wine is a lovely color. Excellent cold weather bedtime top or for layering with a tank. Not the most flattering cut.
4.0,Lasted only a little because of the nose piece and the frame as a whole. It felt very flimsy but it looked very nice on my face. I wasn't sure how I felt for it. It wasn't a item I feel in love with.
4.0,"This dress is fun and cute. It was a little loose around the arm area but I’d rather have that than it be too small or restrictive in the chest. I was a little disappointed because I thought it was supposed to have pockets, but I may have misread that somewhere. Either way, it’s a great dress that can be worn to work, dressed up or down."
4.0,"I bought this shirt in the gray to wear with leggings. I love the flutter sleeves, and the material is a nice quality. I bought my normal size (Large) and wish I would have gone up a size, though. It fits snug through the belly, and by snug, I mean it fits like a second skin, see every lump and bump through the shirt snug.<br /><br />I like my shirts fitted, so it doesn't look like I'm wearing a sack, but because of the type of material, this is especially unforgiving. Also, it is barely long enough to cover the tush, so a little extra length sizing up will give should be perfect. The color was also not as pictured - it's a light-to-medium gray, not the dark gray pictured.<br /><br />I'll be purchasing another shirt, because I do like it and it's super cute, but will be sizing up. I'm wearing this one with dress pants to work instead of with leggings like intended."
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:51102ac6313c0cfa68c3cbedd0047a]] I feel like the band is a little loose where it connects to the actual watch which can make rattle a bit. And then the metal end of the strap came off, but luckily it hasn't frayed the end"
4.0,I like all about the chain but the chain is too long and no way to alter it other than tie a knot.
4.0,Great gloves for gardening and yard work.
4.0,"Not quite as cleanly lacquered as pictured, but still adorable."
4.0,"I liked it, beacause it&#34;s beautiful and it has a good price. Geneva has beautiful watches, this one is so pretty"
4.0,"Great little backpack for the price! I love the color. I got it to carry as my purse/diaperbag for every day use. It easily fits everything I need with room to spare (3 diapers, pack of wipes, change of clothes, a board book, a small toy, dippy cup/snack cup, hand sanitizer, wallet, phone, keys). The only negative is the straps are uncomfortable if I'm hearing a sleeveless shirt. They start to rub after a while since it's just standard nylon strapping without any padding.<br />I'm not sure why some people are saying the straps arent adjustable and only have 2 settings... because mine are fully adjustable and I have had zero issues with the them. Good purchase! Wish i could get one in ever color!"
4.0,good quality pieces for use with 8mm beads
4.0,I love this brand and have been repeatedly satisfied with the quality
4.0,"Casual but nice dress for a great summer day. Comfortably loose around the body, while being fairly short (okay, I am tall, 5ft.9&#34;)"
4.0,"The AlignMed Posture shirt 2.0 Zipper was a better fit when I first received it.  After two weeks of wearing it, the shirt seems to have stretched some.  I have washed (cold water) it 4 times during this period and let it dry on the hanger.  My normal shirt size is in between a medium and large.  I can wear wither depending on the shirt type."
4.0,"Size way down. I have a 38” bust, 32” waist and ordered the large, which was wayyy too big. I exchanged for a medium, which was still a little big, but workable. The fabric is good quality and it seems to be well made."
4.0,Material is stretchy and really thick for what I expected. Great quality for the price and well made. The armholes are huge so it was a little loose just around the arms for me- not very noticeable though. It rides up a little as you walk but the ombré prints kinda cover that. I plan to get it in more colors.
4.0,Thank you I like them
4.0,I bought this to replace the original band for the Polar FT4.  The original band was plastic and cracked and split.<br /><br />This band fits correctly on the Polar FT4 case.  A watch repairman was able to install the replacement band in 5 minutes.  The only complaint is that the non-buckle strap is a bit short.
4.0,Got this for my mom. It fit her Pandora bracelet just fine but was a little smaller than I expected.
4.0,Have to support chance making changes for others for the better. Kudos
4.0,This is the perfect size!  Yoda looks great on the quilt I created.  The colors are bright and the detail is perfect.
4.0,"Definitely cheap, plastic feeling material. And a lot smaller than I thought it'd be - no, I didn't pull out a tape measure before I ordered to get an idea of the size, so yes, that's on me!<br /><br />But, I love the pattern (yay Twin Peaks) and it's the right size for one or 2 nights when you're not carrying it long distances or having it out in the elements.<br /><br />Stuff some clothes inside (I think ziploc bags work WAY better than packing cubes), stick toiletries in the pockets, great bag when you just need to schlep stuff."
4.0,"kept the feet of my toddler safe on hot sand, easy to put on and off"
4.0,They’re cute and look as advertised. My bag had a decent enough mix (except purple) and mostly came in even pairs. One of them was broken before I opened the bag but they’re glass so I’m not too surprised. I made some earrings with some still left over.
4.0,"Extremely soft, definitely the most comfy sweater in my closet. Color (full gray) is great. Length is perfect, only dislike is how short the sleeves are; wish they were a bit longer. Other than that, very good sweater, a bit pricey for what you get in my opinion, but still a good buy."
4.0,There was a variety. Some were really cheaply made
4.0,Don't like fanny packs this the next best thing. Would have give 5 stars if it was just a little bit bigger.
4.0,I purchased an XXL per suggested sizing and it was too big. I am returning.
4.0,the sock is fine but for the price i was expecting a whole package of socks not just 1 but that was my mistake i should have read better otherwise the sock is fine fits well i just wish there were more of them. i received this at a discount for my reveiw
4.0,"I like the stretch and give of the fabric, but these are much thinner than anticipated. They’re not cold weather pants. Also, it took a very long time to get them. They are very cute and comfortable, but just loungers, not winter pants."
4.0,"Nice shirt and comfortable. Light t shirt type material, and pockets! I thought it might have sleeves with thumbholes, but it doesn't. It ran slightly larger than I expected, but still fits."
4.0,Great product.  Had very nice colors.
4.0,"To my thicker size women this dress is definitely  short! I'm 5'6, 220, and I got this in a XXL. It fits and compliments very well, but the dress goes midway to my thigh. Definitely needs something under to keep everything cover. Material feels okay... wore it for a couple minutes and didn't irritate me at all."
4.0,"I put these sandals on immediately before I get in the shower, and take them off when I get out (at the gym). For this purpose, they work great, and I will continue to use them.<br /><br />However, walking around in them for more than five minutes was painful. I would recommend to use them in the shower only."
4.0,Works as expected and fits as expected. The toe separator either feels big or a little scratchy otherwise great
4.0,"I received this belt in exchange for a review but that doesn't prevent me from being totally honest in my evaluations.<br />Not sure why, but it appears that most of the clothing and accessories I am sent to review are somewhat smaller than the size charts list as being correct.  Knowing this, I ordered this belt for a 38&#34; waist size even though my real waist measurement is 34&#34;.  The size 38&#34; belt fits me perfectly with 3 pairs of belt holes to spare as I get old and fat.<br /><br />The leather belt is fairly stiff but with repeated use it will break in. It is listed as genuine leather rather than full grain leather which means that the leather is layered as opposed to being one complete piece of leather which they call 'full grain'.  If you look closely enough at the side of the belt, you can see where the layers are pressed together.  I do not know how they accomplish this process, whether it is with heat, glue or whatever, but you can see it never  the less.  This doesn't mean that the layers will split apart, but if they did, it would probably start at the tip of the belt itself.<br /><br />The metal grommets and the 2 prongs that fit into the grommets seem to be of good and solid quality and the quality of the black dye is very consistent.<br /><br />I do hope this review has been of some help to you in deciding upon your purchase.<br />Thanks for reading."
4.0,Absolutely love it!!! I was excited it fit. I'm 4ft 11 and big chested (42DDD) so I was worried it wouldn't fit around my breast area but did. I had seen other reviews about how the seem is in the front but i was actually able to just flip it around and it fit the same. Pockets were definitely the cherry on top!
4.0,Very nice blouse! I’m 5’6” 118 lbs 32C and the small fits perfect! I’m glad I gave it a try
4.0,"I thought this was a neat looking shirt so I took a gamble when they said they only had an extra small. I usually wear a small and since many garments from China run a size or two smaller I wasnt sure it would fit.<br />Im in luck though because it fits well. Its a tiny bit tighter on me than on the model (it would have looked more like the model had I gotten a small) but its still long and has the tunic length and style.<br />I read that other people who purchased this shirt didnt like how the shoulder cut outs fit, but mine fit exactly where they should. Once again, if I could have gotten a small it would have fit a little baggier around the shoulders and all around but I think its better i got a smaller size. I love the shoulder detail but the rest of the shirt can kind of look like a bad, sort of shapeless.<br />I have to say, like most Allergra K garments Ive purchased, they are well made and I dont see any problems with the stitching or hems.<br />It also got to me weeks before the scheduled time, taking about 2 weeks to arrive.<br /> Cute shirt/ tunic and seems true to US sizes to me."
4.0,Works great with my watch.
4.0,Gawdy
4.0,These are nice sandals however I'm not convinced they are worth the cost. I have only had them for a few weeks so my opinion may change with time. Let's just say I was hoping to be &#34;wowed&#34; by them and this was not the case.
4.0,"I’m 5’6, 36C, 28 waist and 34 hips. I ordered a small. Either the size chart and model information is off or the shirt is very stretchy, because it fits me perfectly. The shoulders are a more poofy and rouched than anticipated but I like everything else about it. The material is thin and a bit scratchy, but anything glittery will be, but it’s not too bad. I could wear this out easily. It’s very sexy. I am normally a small to medium in tops... I’d suggest ordering your normal size and if you’re in between sizes like me to order down."
4.0,"Did not fit right on my body type. Very pretty dress, fabric does not look cheap. Really cute dress."
4.0,"Beautiful big dial, easy to read, comfortable bracelet"
4.0,The color scheme was accurate and my child liked it.
4.0,Adorable.  Bigger frames than expected.  Gave them to my daughter.
4.0,"I usually wear a size 8-10 in dresses, and found that the large was perfect for me. I am 5’1 and 155-160 pounds, but I have a larger chest (38D) so around the chest area it was a little tight, but I hate wearing bras with dresses anyway. Again, another product that I am completely shocked by. I was really surprised at how nice the quality is. I am looking forward to wearing this dress on several occasions."
4.0,Shrinks go a size bigger
4.0,This dress is really cute! I loved wearing it. My only complaints are that it’s a taddddd too long and is relatively sheer around the bust
4.0,"Good tie for the money.  It doesn’t lay very flat on your stomach like I wanted but I could have ironed it I guess.  Was ordered to match a dress, looks true to the color in picture.  Would have easily paid 3x more if found in one of the mall stores."
4.0,cute top. I just need to lose weight to look as good as this model in it lol :D
4.0,Very nice style. Comfy and flatering
4.0,"This is a cool watch for my 8 year old .,we bought this for setting alarm.,In few weeks the screen was broken .,then we don’t have time to return"
4.0,We don't subscribe to all the &#34;energy&#34; stuff...but it's a nice piece of jewelry! A little smaller than expected...
4.0,"It is a little sheer, but if you live in the southern heat and order a dark color, it doesn’t really matter.  Adorable on."
4.0,Love the classic material .ordered etc LG  runs a little small
4.0,very nice piece for the money
4.0,"Beautiful set!  My favorite is the bracelet, I will wear it even without the other pieces in the set.  Yes.  It is that adorable!  Golden color is actually more of a rose hue, but I like that too."
4.0,"I had to return the dress, but I did reorder in a smaller size.  I read the reviews and since most suggested ordering next size up, I did that.  When I tried it on, it was way too big.  I'm thinking  if you're big on top, sizing up might be best, but that certainly didn't work for me.  Regarding the dress and material and design, it is simple, yet quite lovely.  That's why I decided to reorder.  Length was really good for me because I'm quite short (5' 0"") and it came to just a bit above my knees.  It falls really nicely.  I'm definitely looking forward to getting it in the right size!"
4.0,"I am going to make these work .. but order up a few sizes if you like a less &#34;stretched on&#34; fit. Very unique product! Nice thick fabric, great for boots."
4.0,"I was looking for Injini toe socks for an upcoming trip, but they were on back order.  I tried these toe socks.  Like many commented, they do run a bit large.  I wear a size 8.5 running shoe and ordered size Small.  There are no toe seams.  They are comfortable, but not quite the same as the Injini toe socks that I own.  These are a tad thinner.  They did protect my toes while putting on many miles of walking."
4.0,Love love love the pendant!<br />Chain is just okay...
4.0,I love the sweater but the seam on the arm is a little scratchy. Otherwise I love it!
4.0,My daughter indicates it fit a bit snug. Very thin. Similar to underwear.
4.0,Dress was very thin but expected. You do need to wear a slip under under it.<br />Im 5'1 36C  28 inch waist and 35 hips. Dress length reached me and inch below my knee and around the waist a bit loose but nothing I cant fix with a stretch belt. Overall design is nice and clear.
4.0,My grandchildren loved them for gathering shells at the beach.
4.0,They arrived on time and very cute. Buttheads too small for my neck.
4.0,"Got this as a gift for a big Nascar fan.  It is on the smaller side, but great for taking on vacation."
4.0,"The letter is a good size, the thickness is enough to lay flat on a sweatshirt. An18 inch chain is not long enough to be worn with a ""v"" cut shirt (I would prefer a chain that allows different lengths).<br />P'D. Allan"
4.0,My little brother loved this gift he takes it everywhere.
4.0,fits well very cute....
4.0,"Great glasses I use them for work, only thing I dislike about them is the nose part gets loose sometimes other than that great glasses!"
4.0,"The color is black And grey even though the photo shows a navy blue. Other than that, it’s adorable and my daughter loves the big sparkly tutu!"
4.0,not too bad. kinda gawdy but love it.
4.0,"I love the pendant but the picture and description showed a chain with a lobster clasp. When I received the item it had a cheap plastic cord that looked like a baby had been teething on it. The cord looked and was very cheap. I did not get the chain. I had to order another chain but Amazon gave me a credit to use at another time. I have not received the chain yet but at least it is a chain and not a black cheap cord. This was for our secretary for Secretary's Day so I was disappointed that it was not as the picture and description had described. Thank You, Tammy"
4.0,No Complaints. I Need A Size Up For Bust Area.
4.0,Good to stretch for bunions
4.0,"The quality of the pictures, we’re much better than I expected. I love my key chain. Now I do sometimes find the heart not closed completely."
4.0,"Loved the feel and comfort of these masks, however, for an average size person it was a loose fit and didn't stay up on the nose as it should."
4.0,Good looking-
4.0,Just the right length to cover my hips without being a tunic. Material a little heavier than expected so was not able to wear until temps cooled down. Fabric has a bit of stretch to it. Colors are nice and shirt is very comfortable. Overall satisfied with my purchase.
4.0,"Pleasantly surprised by the quality of this dress. It will be a great addition to my summer wardrobe. Please make this in MORE colors....I really would buy one of each color, unfortunately the current color selection is dark and drab."
4.0,Tge tween I bought this for as a gift loves it and immediately hung it up on her bedroom wall!
4.0,Comfy pants
4.0,"Fast shipping. Sturdy, comfortable."
4.0,Awesome for the price.<br />A bit on the large size for us.
4.0,"Super cute, great price. Didn't have as much stretch as I would have liked.  They are a bit snug on my calves."
4.0,"Small fit.<br /><br />I wear it mostly around the neck, the hood set up didn't work for me.<br /><br />But it is always cool putting it on, it feels like I'm a F1 pilot  going to a car race."
4.0,Used for my halloween costume. October's in minnesota are cold so kept me warm and looked great.
4.0,"I got this forever ago in highschool. Im really tall and always have been, and this fit my torso! It was so comfy, I would wear it all the time."
4.0,Such a fun shirt!  You will get many smirks from people😂😂
4.0,Super soft and cozy but huge! I know one size fits all but it could fit 5 of my husbands 😂
4.0,"First--it is difficult to rate how a products fits.  Even those of us who wear the same size clothing can be shaped differently and have different bra sizes and what fits me perfectly may not fit someone else as well.  Additionally, there are tons of people out there who aren't wearing their correct clothing size, anyhow.  Some wear a size smaller because they like a tighter fit or bought it hoping they'd slim down and others may wear something a little bigger.  In this case, I ordered a size larger than what I normally wear as I find swimsuits to typically run a little small and I'd rather not look stuffed into it and have it wear out faster due to stretching it out.<br /><br />By &#34;Somewhat large&#34;, I mean in the chest. It fits perfectly everywhere else, but is too big for my D cups.  It also has absolutely zero chest support.  so I will need to wear a bra with it, which is difficult because it is very low-cut, so my bra will show.  When I sit down, the straps fall off, but that seems to happen with dresses, in general, for me.  Aside from having no chest support (which is always my biggest problem), it fits great and is flattering.<br /><br />Not sure how it holds up in the pool or to multiple uses, but I will update my review once I get to try it out this coming week."
4.0,"Bought this for my 15 year old daughter to use in the Bunny costume she was making for Halloween! The fabric is thin and slightly see through, but not so much that she needed to wear an added layer underneath. A flesh colored bra was all she needed. The seams on the inside look rough, but from the outside you can't tell at all. It doesn't have snap crotch, which is fine to us, because let's face it, snaps in your crotch aren't the most comfortable thing ever.<br /><br />She loves that it has a ribbed texture and it's not plain and flat. It makes it look a little more dressier than a typical leotard.<br /><br />Zipper on the back is long and strong. No problems getting it on at all.<br /><br />Well worth the price!"
4.0,"So many compliments!  I really love this dress.  Much nicer look and feel than you'd expect!!!  Zipper a little sticky sometimes but for the price, great.  Wore it too a wedding and it held its own with a room full of fancy long dresses!"
4.0,"I got the dress in the white with black horizontal stripes. It is not a true white, more cream or off white. It is also a bit see through, a bit more than I am comfortable with. The material is a bit clingy. The black lines do not match up at the seams. I know lots of manufacturers these days do not take the time to match the seams but it bugs me and is particularly noticeable in this dress."
4.0,"He says these are very comfortable to wear, but the green does not liok the one pictured.  The one received was more of a pea soup green. The grey ones were fine."
4.0,Great price for such a fashionable pair of glasses. They are very light and you don’t even realize they are on your head. You’ll have to get use to the darkness and they are a little loose.
4.0,"I normally wear a small but ordered the medium. The medium fits just right, not right but definitely not a loose fit shirt. The material is somewhat thick and stretchy. The description says grey/red but it’s actually white/red."
4.0,"This was the first time I tried these kinds of socks with two toe areas. It works well, but one foot, my right one, tends to bunch up towards the multi-toe area and puff out. Don't know what's up with that, but I wouldn't be surprised if it had to do with the fact that my right foot and ankle swells more due to the fact of a bad sprain way back when I was taking my senior picture. So it might (and probably is) me!"
4.0,"This goggles work depend on the person. When I wore this in the pool they were blurry for me, but for my son he could see perfectly. I believe this happens because the goggles are curved and not straight."
4.0,This ring is stunning but way too big after following the recommendation to size up. I'll be returning it and hoping the size 7 restocks soon so I can buy again.
4.0,Nice shorts. Good price
4.0,Great dress. It’s very fitted. I would definitely order one size up.
4.0,"The magnet bands are fantastic, the iridescent band is so beautiful.  The magnet closure makes It easy to take on and off."
4.0,"Beautiful bows, seem to be made with great quality.  The only reason I'm not giving them 5 stars is that they are much bigger than I expected and I don't think it states just what size they are.  They are probably 2.5 inches long.  However, I will keep them to use once my daughter gets bigger."
4.0,"Legs openings are narrow. Barely fit my 2 year old. Better than regular underwear, so you don't end up with a puddle, but def. not leak proof."
4.0,"These pants are very pretty and comfortable, lovely soft drapey fabric, but it is somewhat sheer....great for yoga or loungewear but probably not for actual pants. Also do note the photo makes them appear white, they are actually ecru/off-white/cream color.<br /><br />I should note however....I am usually a size 12 in pants and these are a good fit on me, with a little room to spare. They're listed as &#34;0-12&#34; and I think anyone smaller than about a size 8 is going to be swimming in these."
4.0,The chain is like a choker size. Small viel. Color and glow is good.
4.0,My wife is 5 feet 2 inches and 125 pounds. She usually wears a small but because of the previous comments she bought it mediun. The bra fits her perfect but the bottom is a little small. Very good material and beautiful swimsuit.
4.0,"We have hardwood flooring throughout a good part of the house, and laminate flooring in the basement.  Hardwood stairs can be slippery, and the laminate is quite slick.<br /><br />Wearing good sandals is one way to help with that.  On chilly winter days (or early spring / late fall), these socks warm your feet (my moccasins are too warm) while providing a lot of grip on these hard surfaces.  Definitely increases safety coming down the stairs, very important especially for older people.<br /><br />Price is not cheap, but they do serve a safety function."
4.0,"Doesn’t have the stretch I was expecting,but overall I pleased with the purchase I’ll be buying more..."
4.0,Loved the fit! The neckline was just a little low!
4.0,"Cute, made well, better than I expected. Have not washed or worn, do not know how it withstand those."
4.0,A little big in the shoulders but I like it.
4.0,"Yes these are small, but have worn them for a couple of weeks now with no irritation. Good bargain."
4.0,Liked the sweatshirt. The pockets are cool to keep useful stuff while exercising.
4.0,"Good quality construction and material.  It's a bit big and can be worn as a shirt-jac.  It has a contrasting colored interior collar that I didn't care for, but overall, I like it and wear it regularly."
4.0,I like the mask for mowing lawn in dusty conditions.  And great value qty 50 less than $10.  Not sure why half are black and other half are almost white.  Find myself grabbing the white most of the time.  Next time I'll find package of all white.
4.0,Absolutely beautiful. The watch band was a bit hard to remove links and the link remover tool did not have the pin to even remove the links. It's actually the wrong tool to use. I just used a tiny flathead screw driver like the ones you get in eye glass tool kits. I have a video on YouTube for a more closer look at the watch
4.0,I really like this pocketbook just not as large as I thought it would be. Really nice and attracted to carry. Thanks
4.0,"Very pleased with product and build quality, but the crazy horse khaki is a lot lighter in color than what is shown in the picture"
4.0,I plan to use them when on a Safari in Africa.  They will work perfectly for me.
4.0,Don’t know why they advised this as birthstone recipients were confused also!!
4.0,It's awesome just ordered to big of a size :(
4.0,I think the compression socks are far superior to the crew socks.  Still making my mind up for the long haul (how do they wear) but a month into it they seem to perform as advertised.
4.0,The clasps are very weak.
4.0,The sweater is really cute and comfortable. It washes up perfectly!
4.0,Really cute. I'm an 18 :( and it fit just fine. Makes you feel cute.
4.0,The bra has a lot of support it makes your cleavage look amazing. Ione warning is that if you have big boobs this is not for you. I ware a 38DD and it didn’t fit me. I suggest for only women with D or bellow. Otherwise amazing product. I am able to ware it and it’ll cover the areola part but i have to be careful of not falling out.
4.0,Very cute. Nice price
4.0,Fun for an outfit! I feel like Harry Potter and am ready to read the Dictionary
4.0,Fit perfect and had a lot of compliments on it.  Only &#34;issue&#34; i have is that the scales on the bottom part were a lot more spread out that in the picture. Still very cute and I will order again! :)
4.0,Very pretty and seemingly well made. It's a little big but my daughter loved it.
4.0,Enjoying during cold weather. Also the Prime driver was so nice to bring the package to our door up a long icy driveway.
4.0,"I've purchased these a few times and although I love them, the gold strings unravel sometimes while in the package, before taking them out.  I've had to glue the gold strings back in order to keep the earrings intact."
4.0,"Nice fit, very flattering pattern, pretty and comfy.  However, an hour in, I notice I must’ve snagged it twice unknowingly in the same sleeve."
4.0,My bf loves these. Wears them all the time. Great buy
4.0,Is a tight fit but ok
4.0,Love LOVE these super cute and cozy for around the house and last minute errands!
4.0,"Exactly what I wanted -- not tight but not loose, sticks to skin just kind of; perfect for concerts. This is a good quality, simple crop top. Looking for a good simple cotton black crop top this is the one to choose."
4.0,Gold looks almost real !
4.0,Live this retro bathing suit. Cute AF and I can wear it around kids and their parents. Appropriate.
4.0,"I bought this tie for my wedding.  At fist, I was skeptical of buying this tie because of other reviews that I had read.  However, I was pleasantly surprised when the product arrived to see that the quality was much better than I thought it would be.  Because of the material, I am confident that this tie will last a LONG time.  It doesn't seem like it can fray easily. Not the highest quality tie ever, but you get what you pay for. The only low quality aspect of this tie is the stitching job on the back, but that can easily be fixed."
4.0,Does the trick; nice and light for summer
4.0,"Nice,  i used the size chart, was 2 sizes to big..."
4.0,"These are nice earrings but it's not very clear that they are butterflies. They look more like leaves or a fancy X,"
4.0,I absolutely love this clutch. It matches perfectly with the Dooney & Bourke handbag and is such a beautiful color.
4.0,"These socks work great but beware the white ones, I don’t know why but they seem to run a full size smaller and have less stretch than their dyed counterparts. I bought 3 pairs in the same size and my black/pink and grey/blue stripes pairs fit perfect. The white black ones are super small and can barely get 3/4 the way up my calf. I have worn these in XL and L and all of my dyed pairs fit fine. The white black seem to have almost no stretch. Beware! Otherwise a great compression sock that helps me get though 12 hour healthcare shifts."
4.0,So far so good. It seems to work fine when I have toyed around with it. I haven't actually had a chance to test it in the rain though. Item was as described.
4.0,I ordered it a size larger than normal because of the reviews that said there was little to no give in the waist. This was a mistake. I should have gone with my gut and ordered a small rather than a medium (5'6 - 150lb). But that is my fault and not the fault of the manufacturers. This is lovely and fit's great.
4.0,"These shoes look absolutely adorable on my daughter, and because they’re cute she likes them a lot. However, she said there are just too many straps. They’re not very comfortable. I don’t know if it’s because there are so many, or if the straps are just not comfortable in general. I’ve also noticed it comes up a bit higher in the back than usual for this kind of sandal, but that’s not something that bothers her.<br />The quality of the shoes appears good. My kids can be pretty tough on things, and these are holding up nicely."
4.0,One earring was detached from the post but can be fixed . Otherwise they are beautiful
4.0,Little big but plan to put additional inserts
4.0,Fit great a little see through but I made it work with my costume. Love it!!
4.0,Seem to be larger then other shoes this size.but well made. very happy with quality.
4.0,perfectly fun dress
4.0,I've had these for 3 years and they are pretty good. I haven't changed the paint on them since I got them so I don't know how easily the paint comes off. Nails are a little funny looking. Good product though.
4.0,Really keep your arms cool especially playing golf in the desert
4.0,Quality Jersey.
4.0,I’ve been looking for nylon panties for some time that are quality and fit right. These fit me ok and are better then anything I’ve come across in a long time. My only issue is that they come up to high past my waste. I wanted them for dresses so the nylon wouldn’t stick like cotton does. Having them above my belly button to keep my dress from sticking to my panties is how it’s gonna have to be for now.
4.0,"These are super cute, but heavy."
4.0,"Very cute,extremely warm..But a bit tight around the waist needed more room."
4.0,"This is our new weekend wear! My 4 year old got this for dance class, and wears it all weekend long. It holds up to washing and drying, even though I think the care tag says not to. Can't be too precious with these things. It fits perfectly and the cross straps in the back are very sweet."
4.0,"A very nice belt in a faux leather look. Well constructed and as pictured except, the spots are a bit darker than shown in the photo. They are gun metal in color as is the other hardware. A great accessory for steampunk, pirate or bohemian. Arrived quickly and was even delivered on Labor Day!"
4.0,Great for the summer!
4.0,My 8-yr old loves it!  Slightly bigger than expected.. would be helpful to add ages/sizes to description for future shoppers.<br />but super easy and fun.
4.0,"I love this bag. It was a gift to my daughter, plenty of room I definitely recommend it."
4.0,"As the title suggests. I’m a stout/athletic guy and was looking for comfortable, casual cargos. These looked great in the ad but in reality they were at least 2 sizes too small"
4.0,"I'm usually a 1x in US sizes though, depending on the material of an item, I sometimes get a 2x since I prefer my clothes a little loose. That being said I've ordered many things from Chinese clothing sites so I know to always get a 5x, and that holds true with this dress as well. Fit pretty good, the neckline is a little baggie (I'm a D/DD) but thats isnt the reason I'm returning the one I bought. I ordered the black colored one, based on the pictures, I liked its print the best; seemed bright with yellows and pinks and blues. However in person its so dull and washed out. Good funeral dress maybe as it's really dreary looking. It photographed great however, looks bright in the picture I took of it, but on you, under normal lights, it's just sad. I'm going to reorder in the blue and hope for a better look."
4.0,Great colors & well-made.  Just would have wanted a little smaller size.
4.0,It’s a nice wallet but it’s a little bit small and there’s no place to put the change.
4.0,"Really dig' this wedge! Once it was delivered and I tried them on, I knew I'd be wearing it ALOT and had to order a backup pair!  They're so comfy and you wouldn't think so, since it has a 4-1/2"" heel.  It goes great with jeans, capris, crops... everything!<br /><br />Props to On Your Feet... Looking forward to buying more from this maker!"
4.0,"Cute! Be careful with the material, it will snag...but nice for the price."
4.0,"I had some alterations done, after that, it  fits perfectly. I felt like I can float in the dress. Love it. :)))))))))"
4.0,"I lost one of mine after one use, but I did really like them. Although, they were really small! I wish they would have a picture to show the size."
4.0,Fits one size smaller than advertised! Material is a bit thin also.
4.0,The dress fits well. However it was extremely short.
4.0,"I bought these for my Dr. Who obsessed sister in law for Christmas. She seemed to like them a lot. She plans on wearing them with the Tardis necklace that she already owns. The only complaints that I have are that they were WAY smaller than I thought that they would be and in turn made them not have as much detail as I had hoped for. With that said, they were not expensive at all, so the cost to value ratio makes these a solid 4 stars for me."
4.0,"Plenty of bands to do braids for her, get to do lots of Elsa braids, and they last and stretch, recieved at discount from my review."
4.0,"I regularly break and lose sunglasses so I'm often hesitant to take my $200 Ray Bans with me for sporting activities or yard work. Plus I always need a backup pair. These SUASI glasses are very similar in the square shape as my Ray Bans and are fairly wide--which I need. Despite their price, the construction is good. With less expensive sunglasses I worry about hinges breaking or the lenses falling out. So far, after a couple weeks of use, these show no signs of falling apart.<br /><br />The styling is simple and unembellished, and that's OK for a spare pair. The lenses are very clear with no warping or distortion--another problem I encounter with inexpensive glasses. The shade of the lenses is good for bright conditions, but maybe a bit too dark in overcast weather. The nose bridge seems comfortable for extended wearing and the arms were comfortable. Overall, this is a nice pair of sunglasses that look more expensive than they are. I purchased these at a discount in exchange for an honest review and would recommend them."
4.0,"Super cute, look exactly like the picture. Bought these for my bf, he hasn't worn them out so don't know how they feel, yet."
4.0,True to size and extremely comfortable
4.0,"This is a very elegant cross and I'm sure it will be enjoyed for many years.  I wanted to order a very simple cross for my Mother.  It is just a plain cross...on one side, it is like that diamond-cut, etched looking gold on the other side, but not too fancy.  That's the only reason I didn't give it five stars, because the plain side that is shown on the picture seems to be the back of the actual pendant, but it isn't a big deal as it is a very stunning little cross.  It was delivered extremely quickly and I highly recommend it."
4.0,It was fit as expected.
4.0,"I like this rag, I have a large head and this thing fits good, I like to wear these so they cover the top of my ears and it does."
4.0,Will break but cute while it lasts!
4.0,"nice, pretty and was the size I thought they would be"
4.0,"The pack of socks I received contained 3 different sizes. I would have preferred they all be of the longest length as I don't care for shorter socks. I would suggest the seller edit their description of the socks as they are not 53% wool but 35%. The socks are also not thick. They are comparable to any of the standard socks I wear with my tennis shoes. The thickest part of the sock is the ribbed top, which does actually stay up fairly well. The socks are fairly soft, but the knitting has some flaws in places. I would not wear these with my hiking boots - they aren't tall enough or thick enough to provide the needed protection. Overall, nice colors/patterns and comfortable enough for me to wear when lounging around the house."
4.0,"My husband really liked this jacket and it looked really good on him. I think it is very convenient because unlike other pleather jackets it is not too thick. The last one he had was a hassle to carry around and had some good weight too it, this one is much more sleek and still manages to keep him pretty warm. The fit is nice definitely made for more slimmer or athletic types. The only downside for me was how long it took for it to be delivered, almost a month, but I was very happy once I got it. Would recommend but would also recommend you get it only if you plan on wearing it in the future because of the shipping."
4.0,"My own clumsiness makes platform shoes hard to use for me, but these worked out wonderfully. They were really really narrow but they broke in pretty easily. You'll want some shoe glue on hand because the soles do start to detach rather quickly, but they're so cheap what do you expect? Just repair them as you go and they'll last for a while!"
4.0,They worked amazing.  Actually  kept my feet warm. Will be buying more.
4.0,"I ordered a large because I wanted it to be a looser fit. It fit as expected except for the fact that the legs are a little short. That works for me because I bought it for a party and am going to wear shoes/boots, but I could see that as a detriment for actual pajamas. On the plus side it has very soft fabric."
4.0,Cute accessory for your boots!  I get lots of compliments on them!
4.0,Good fit. Good quality material. Expected the emblem to be monogrammed but it wasn’t. Otherwise we are happy with the purchase.
4.0,"Bought this for my girlfriend and she really enjoys it! She wasn't in the market for anything too expensive and she just wants to test out this choker trend. They all fit nicely so if you are worried about the sizing it is fine, it will fit everyone. These chokers aren't the highest quality here but you have to consider the price in this and this is made for people to just accessorize without any commitment to expensive pieces. She does wish that the clasps could be off better quality since you want the product to stay on your neck but theres nothing like buying extra lobster clasps at Joanns."
4.0,"Very good quality, cool mask ! Nice color. I love them"
4.0,Beautiful looks like picture. Just don’t wear it in any water. The blue comes off VERY EASY.
4.0,Scratch easily and seem a little too light weight.
4.0,"This coat is a great coat for the price. Fits well and true to size, but the pink is a little deeper than the photo appears. Overall it is gorgeous and looks well made, not cheap."
4.0,"Cute tank top, light-weight and comfortable."
4.0,The biketards were both as depicted. I didn't give a five because they came in separate packages. One came in time for delivery and the other one didn't.
4.0,"Fits big, but a belt helps! It’s also thin so don’t expect to be warm in them. Overall very stylish I wear all the time for work!"
4.0,It seems almost as if it's a new production made by Rothco. It's in excellent shape if true surplus.
4.0,"Well at first i was worried about some reviews saying it doesn't last long. But after 2.5 years the shock feature finally died.<br />The app is dumb,bit requires media access to connect to it but that's dumb. I just want a dedicated shock alarm with a simple app."
4.0,"Great gift for a Sailor Moon fan ,"
4.0,"I love the relaxed fit and pockets for wearing around the house. The tie dye print, color and detail on the back are nice as well. I ordered another because I like it so much. I’m breastfeeding and it’s easy to slip down and get my arm out quickly to accommodate this."
4.0,"It is adorable in person. I however normally wear a medium to larges and the extra larges barely covers on the top so any one ordering, id get a size larger than usual."
4.0,Good for the price. Very causal. They don't look expensive but they are fun.
4.0,"I got these for a prop I needed in a play I'm directing.  I'm glad there were two, I couldn't get the one to inflate when I tried blowing it up; and rather than pass it to someone else after I had tried, someone else had better luck with the second one."
4.0,I have a small head and this is just a tiny bit tight. Had to stretch.
4.0,"This cardigan is a good one. The fabric is just medium, not too thick nor too thin which is good to wear, I find the size to be little large for medium. Overall a good one"
4.0,"It was a little small. I ordered a 24months for a 18month old, and it barely fit."
4.0,I really like this bag.  I have always liked her style.  The reason that I gave this bag four stars is because the zipper is down inside the bag.  Her other bags are easier to use because the zipper is on top.  Still it is a great bag though.
4.0,"Very low cut, and does not slip, I love that."
4.0,"The material is a little bit thinner than I expected, but it still doesn't feel or look cheap. I ordered one of the black printed tee at the same time and really really like that one."
4.0,"Beautiful. Very delicate. Mine just so happen to have 1 of the 2 buttons missing, easy fix— this the 4/5 stars"
4.0,"The shoes fit fine, the material seems a bit thin, so they didn’t send the product in a box, they just smushed them together in a bag so the insole / sole of one boot is creased inside and may take a long time to get back to its original shape. Overall they are cute but they could do a better job with shipping."
4.0,"This is a really cute bag, only wish the backside was as lovely as the front."
4.0,Hat runs small.  Be sure to buy a big enough size.  Hat is very warm.
4.0,it is very good quality and i really enjoyed how the words on it looked so real and almost exactly the same as in the TV show once upon a time
4.0,the product fits great! remember you should go down a size im a 100 lbs and 5'1'' and im a size 4 usually but i went down to size 2. these pants are super stretchy so they'll stretch to fit and show all your freat curves and such! the reason why i knocked off a star is because the color. it was not the same color as the picture provided per product sale. i had to bleach it a little and wash it in hot water by itself to get the desired color
4.0,"Nice, just like the picture, many compliments."
4.0,"A very nice dress, fits great. Received many nice compliments on this dress. Very comfortable."
4.0,"The hoodie dress was delivered quickly and packaged neatly.  It looks just like the picture online.  My only complaint is that the material is very thin.  I originally thought it would be similar to a sweatshirt-type hoodie, but the material is only slightly heavier than a good t-shirt.<br />It will still be ok as loungewear, just not as warm as I was expecting."
4.0,Really shades your eyes
4.0,I'm really happy with my Fit Over shades.  They fit very well and really cut the glare.
4.0,"This apron reminds me of the women long ago that used them all the time.  I found doing the dishes that sometimes the water splashed on my clothes... so yes, I got an apron!  LOL  Being a plus size woman, I needed one that would accommodate my size, so I got this one with long straps at the neck and waist area.  It fits well and is retro cute!  Love having the pockets, too.  The apron front is a hearty fabric and will hold up.  And the ties are a lighter cotton, so they aren't too heavy on your neck, nor hard to tie behind you.  I would recommend this product."
4.0,I thought the quality of the shirt was very good..  The fit felt like a large instead of XL.
4.0,small gift
4.0,Love it and all things CAPRICORN
4.0,fabric is good qaulity.  the outfits is true to the size and look just like the picture. the only issue I had was the flower on the shirt. it fell off after getting wash. I suggest just hand wash it.
4.0,I like it...a lot.
4.0,They’re super cute
4.0,the material is a little clingy but other than that I have enjoyed wearing this top
4.0,"Dress is very cute but I am disappointed with the packaging, the bottom came out frayed"
4.0,Last year for school we bought a pair of umi same style. My kids loved them. They were soft and lasted almost the whole year. We were unable to buy them this year because sizes were not available. These look identical.  However they are stiff when we first received. Our boys didn’t love them but they are breaking in after 2 weeks and the boys have not complained they hurt.<br />Good second choice but my first still is the umi brand.
4.0,"Super cute, great quality sweater for a reasonable price! I wore this sweater to an Ugly Sweater Party and I had the cutest &#34;ugly&#34; sweater there! Great product for the price. The only complaint I would have is that it fit a little big on me. The sleeves were loooooooooooong. Lol"
4.0,Cute simple and cheap. Perfect for a quick beach vacay :)
4.0,I purchased a size7 but wishing that they came in a 7.5. My left foot is slightly larger but they are still great sandals. They are comfortable and it did not take long to get use to the arch.....would buy again...just might try a size 8.
4.0,Grand children love them
4.0,"Love. This. Item.  I purchased it for a trip to Mexico as I was trying to limit my carry on bags and wanted to take something smaller than the usual bag I take on planes.  The bag is well constructed and holds a lot.  I had my ipad in a case, kindle in a case, the two W&R cases (with kindle charger, iphone and ipad chargers and portable charger as well as passport and change purse), my headphones (out of case), a small zip pouch (with chapstick, tylenol, etc), two packs of gum, my sunglasses, small kleenex and my phone.  It all fit just fine in the bag!  The bag does NOT fit in all seatback pockets.  The smaller of the Delta flights I took did not work and I chose to put it under the seat instead of hang from the tray as I had the aisle seat and did not want to move for people getting in and out.  I used the hook to pull the bag up from under the seat after the flight and it was so convenient.  The three other legs of the flights had varying seatback sizes and it fit in all of them (some just better than others).  The bag is just about perfect, but there are a few requests I would love to see in future versions: 1) RFID in the one pull-out pouch and in the outside zip pocket,  2) some sort of clip on bottle holder (could have used my own, but would just be nice to see a matching one), 3) a slip pocket on the back of the bag for when you are wearing it versus putting in the pocket and 4) more colors.  I LOVE the bright green on the inside of the grey bag, but didn't love the pinstripe look as much as I am not a business traveler.  I would like to see more colors than black and grey pinstripe - some neutrals such as navy or cadet blue, plain charcoal, or even some lighter colors (though I think those might show dirt from the seatback pockets more).  All in all, this is an almost perfect bag and I would buy again in a heartbeat."
4.0,"I had to send it back as it was too small. The outfit looks nice, I may reorder it."
4.0,"Cute sweater, fits fine. Always have been a fan of Target's clothing, the price ok; saving time from driving to the store & hunt down bargains makes this purchase worth it."
4.0,"Shaper fits as expected. It is sized small, however. I wear a M, but had to get a 3XL for the correct fit. It does smooth my stomach & is comfortable to wear all day."
4.0,"Good fit, a lot better than taping for practice every day."
4.0,"these pants are ok.  The fit is true to size and I love the elastic waist.  The tailoring is just so-so.  Some of the seams are a little off. The fabric is ok - not see through at all.  The pants wash and dry well.  I like a more tailored fit, but not the price of well tailored pants, so these pants are a good compromise.  I've worn them for business casual occasions and they are fine. I won't wear them for dressy occasions, however."
4.0,Loved this dress. It matched my maternity dress perfectly and looked adorable on my daughter. She wants it in different colors now.
4.0,"Very pretty, but very tight on wrist."
4.0,"Aside from the stiff, itchy and poky tag on the side, the shirt fits as I expected it would (I like a looser fit, so I went up a size.) I love the longer than t-shirt length, too. This is my first tunic top.<br />I find the material of the top itself to be SUPER soft and a bit stretchy. I could almost live in this top (just change the tag! Better yet go tagless!)<br />Add more colors, please."
4.0,"It's great. Live the three matching items, lovely."
4.0,"Good for the price. It's cute. My daughter loves it. The fabric snags easily and the bottom isn't hemmed, but the fabric doesn't fray so I don't expect it to become a problem. It does run small in my opinion. It's a good fit on my 10 year old, who wears a girls XL or juniors small. It's quite stretchy so it would probably fit a size larger as well, but it's not as big as I would normally expect from a &#34;one size&#34; garment."
4.0,Cute leggings. Super high waist on me. Quality for the price.
4.0,"It's a little small, but this necklace is beautiful. I love it. I think it was worth the money."
4.0,"I was SO Excited when this shirt arrived.  As a Navy Master Diver, this a a perfect shirt for my lifestyle!<br />However, the reason I did not give 5 stars ⭐️,<br />Is these shirts run small.  I am a XL, and I guess I need a XXL or even XXXL in this shirt.  So my wife got a new diver shirt instead.<br />To the company, please let me know if I can order a XXL size."
4.0,"Update 2019.11.23: I've been wearing this band for a couple of months now (every second day roughly), and it is holing up well.  The finish still looks new even at the lowest point the clasp. I'm still very happy with this purchase.<br /><br />Just been wearing it for 1/2 a day, so I just want to mention that this band is a good match for the Apple S5 black Ti 44mm watch.<br /><br />It is pretty easy to adjust the band to the correct size using the little tool provided, and even though I have proper springbar tools I used the provided tool just to ensure that most people could easily size the band without additional tools.  There are enough regular links and 2 1/2 links to get the band sized correctly.  There is no micro adjustment mechanism in the clasp or link construction.<br /><br />I'm not crazy over this band, but it really matches the watch nicely.  I'll look for a better quality one, but I'm in no hurry as this one is well suited to the watch.  I think this band is a good value.<br /><br />I'll try to report back how the band holds up after I've used it for a longer period of time."
4.0,I like the mask looks really cool but it makes a weird noise and gets really annoying. But the mask looks good and lights up well
4.0,"Very cute studs, I hope these last longer than others I have purchased form other dealers on Amazon."
4.0,"Earrings look just like they do online! They are made fairly cheap, but overall they are what you’d expect. The packaging also comes with lots of extra backings, which is great!"
4.0,The natural born southerner appreciates warm feet provided by these sock. New northern relocation issue has been resolved with the wonderful socks. I highly recommend them to others especially on those cold cold days and nights. Just remember air dry them to take care of them. No tumble drying.
4.0,Love this dress! I do recommend ordering one size up - I normally wear a medium but ordered a large and it fits great.
4.0,"I love my shirt. It's a little small, but I love it just the same."
4.0,Need to break in a good product for the price.
4.0,"I bought this because I wanted an inexpensive handbag for traveling. I don't like to take my more expensive bags when I travel for reasons of safety and practicality. It was very large and fit all the contents of my handbag as well as some travel supplies. I love the color, it looks as presented in the ad. The zippers are durable and the pockets are large enough to put your hand into without getting stuck."
4.0,Its a standard no frills tshirt. I like bewbs
4.0,"My grandson likes these BUT the stuffing was not properly distributed in the fingers ... if these were purchased locally, I would have returned them for another set ... but, since my grandson is young and didn't realize there was NO stuffing in part of the hand - I kept them.  I do like the quality I just wish the person doing the &#34;quality control&#34; was doing their job better."
4.0,"This is an attractive bracelet with onyx cut stones and two stainless steel accents.<br /><br />I got the version with the blue vein contrasting stones, and they are the reason I deducted one star. They are a varied lot, most of them MUCH darker than they appear on the product page -- almost more black than blue.<br /><br />So whichever bracelet you choose, be prepared for the possibility that the contrasting stones won't appear as appealing as they do in the photos...<br /><br />Otherwise, the piece comes with a storage pouch and costs just ten bucks. It also belies the ridonculous three-figure price charged by some fancy Scandinavian brand for a very similar bracelet with over-the-top packaging."
4.0,The bows are smaller than in the picture.
4.0,"Very good jacket, warm, zipper tends to get stuck"
4.0,"Very nice looking. However, quality is slightly cheap."
4.0,"I love the colors, and the big red stone on it. There isn’t anything I don’t like. I would recommend it to Wonder Woman fans anywhere. ❤️💛💙"
4.0,"I like the watch, but the face is pretty big. Too flashy. It also doesn't fit very well. It's either impossibly tight or too large."
4.0,"A most versatile and presentable pocket square. I would be more pleased if it were a 16 in square rather than measuring 12.5 inches. Nice accent, gives a 'pop'. If wearing most conventional suit coats or jackets.<br />Reccomend."
4.0,It’s light but can improve the comfort
4.0,This jacket was a nice fit. The red in the jacket and the red on the trim are two different shades but it was not a big deal to me.
4.0,I have only been using the glasses for a few days now so that's why the four stars.  They seem to be helping; I can see the blue tint on the lens; very clear when reading small print.  I actually like these better than the pair I bought from my optometrist.
4.0,Cute Bag but can't put alot in it!
4.0,"It’s definitely not compression.  It’s not super tight, I guess it will work for running around the house."
4.0,"Got me through a winter season up at Badger Pass in Yosemite National Park as the only current park employee in a wheelchair. Only one time all winter did water penetrate through to the inner liner, and I had lent them to a careless teen on the slopes. The rubber threads all over the palm wore off right away, but beyond that they were almost perfect. Thick and water resistant enough to keep me warm and dry despite ice cold and wet hand rims on my wheelchair all winter. Enough grip to not make hills overly difficult."
4.0,looks amazzing!!
4.0,"My grandson loves the shoes, however, even for an eight year old they are slightly hard to put on. Getting the right toes in the right slots is something of a challenge."
4.0,Worked well for take home outfit for 8 lbs newborn but did not realize it has buttons. Only wore once. We still use the hat with other outfits.
4.0,Looks a bit large on the sides when wearing but material is substantial and well made. Blinking logo is fun for a night game but feels big on the head.
4.0,This is one of my favourite necklaces now!<br />The hook that connects the pendant to the<br />chain broke pretty quickly but the pendent<br />itself is great and the chain is fine as well.
4.0,"The sweatshirt is super cute. I wear a S in tops normally. I ordered a M for the sweatshirt, so I can layer. The M fits like a S and I won't be able to wear much underneath it. Still, very happy with the sweatshirt."
4.0,The zipper has fallen off 3 times in 3 months with minimal use.
4.0,This dress is very comfortable & the fabric is super soft.
4.0,"Thank You, Thank You very Much..."
4.0,"Color is spot on for the rose gold clock face. It is very pretty and the band is smooth. Didn't have any hair pulling.  It feels great when I first put it on, but after a while it becomes a little loose. I usually wear the velcro bands, so there is no movement at all, so even the little bit of loosing up bothers me. I am a preschool teacher, so I'm constantly moving, so while I won't wear this band to school anymore, I definitely love it for going out. Dresses up the watch. I would buy again."
4.0,"This is a great keychain to have especially for Batman lovers. It is cute and tiny. However, I'm always afraid of it breaking apart in my bag."
4.0,I liked that these were more of a yoga pant material. I bought them for work and they are decently comfortable.  My only complaint is that you can see the outline of the pocket due to the material. They were also longer than I expected but I am 5’1 so I have to roll the bottoms.
4.0,"Bought the XXL for a 170# 5'10&#34; man. This jacket will not fit anyone larger.  Otherwise it's a great casual, lightweight jacket for the price."
4.0,Giving 4 stars for 2 reasons 1 the clasp the locks in place is super loose. Kind of a pain to put in. 2 the stone fell out and the ring started to turn green only had this clicker for a few months and I don't wear it all the time just on the weekends. Overall for the price it was a good purchase.
4.0,"It’s an adorable dress, it’s just extremely long on my daughter. I wasn’t a huge fan of the length but the overall dress is cute. If you have a short kid, I don’t suggest it."
4.0,"These are very comfortable. I'm usually an XS/S, I got the small and it has a nice loose fit. I got these to wear around the house, but you could definitely dress them up to wear out as well."
4.0,"I have actually never really cleaned jewelry, but now that I have a good amount of silver pieces, I figured it was time to get a cleaner!<br />I love that it's all natural and I thought it did a good job! very nice."
4.0,I absolutely love this dress. The fabric is soft and comfortable for all day wear.
4.0,"I am keeping this cover, but it is definitely something you can only wear to the beach or swimming pool."
4.0,"Ordered Dec 9th rcfe Dec 21st, I am 5'7 wear size 18 US. I loved my dress right. I got the 14plus=XXL but if you want loose then I should have gotten XXXL but it's a sign I need to eat less to wear this will post pic soon. Material is not flimsy."
4.0,"Overall it's a pretty good case!  The gold color is just a little off compared to the actual gold coloring on the iPhone, but nothing bad.  It's very flexible so it's easy to take on and off.  My only concern is that this is more for decoration than protection.  It doesn't have a raise edge to protect the screen if you drop it on its face.  Otherwise it's a nice case!  Looks exactly like the picture."
4.0,I love them but the only thing I don't like is the size. They are a little to big for my head and slip down on my nose. There isn't really any way bend them either.
4.0,I like it.price was right
4.0,"Adorable and made well, but I wish it was a tad bigger. My wallet and iPhone 8 Plus doesn’t quite fit together."
4.0,"It's hilarious! I had to buy it to wear it to The Las Jedi. It was made for someone with a smaller coconut than mine, but I still love it! It's warm, it's kitschy, what's not to like?"
4.0,Liked the shirt but weird material
4.0,"This brand has great comfortable jeans. I brought the majority of them and they all have their pros and cons. I ordered a XXL. I weigh about 255-260. I feel compared to their other jeans, this one fit the tightest. it fits if this is your size, it's no wiggle room on the waist. the rest of the jean is great!"
4.0,"nice pretty dress. Altough 30$ is too much, this should cost around 22$ ish."
4.0,"Only reason I’m giving four stars is because it hasn’t been worn yet. But I was scared it would be baggy, but it looks great! Nice material too"
4.0,"Great looking lanyard that seems to be well built. The nice materials makes this lanyard feel premium. The only issue I have with this lanyard is that the metal pieces squeak when you walk around. WD-40 solves it for awhile but the noise eventually comes back. It's a small issue and I'm still happy with the product, but it's something to take into consideration."
4.0,Very happy with this top.  It fit as expected and the material is soft.
4.0,"Love 90 degree leggings. They are so comfortable and soft. They tend to run a tad on the smaller size but I don't mind. I purchased a Large because after I wear them a few times they tend to loosen up comma I did not want my leggings to be too loose. The only issue that I have is the threads tend to come undone around the ankle, I have another pair of the black leggings in large, but they are the midcalf length and the stitching around the calf is coming unthreaded. Not the end of the world thats what sewing machines are for but it would be nice if the stitching was more durable. Thats why I gave them 4 stars. Love these leggings!!"
4.0,It's just perfect . Just like in the pic. Am 5feet 8inches talk an the length is perfect.
4.0,"Love the look, and receive compliments every time I wear it! Only reason for 4 stars is the sizing. I ordered an XL, as people recommended to size up. I wish I hadn't. I've altered the top a few times, as it just looks too bulky and didn't fit snug across the chest. I'm a 10/12, 36B for reference."
4.0,Pretty purse. Wish it stood up better and that the top zipper was on the top instead of the side.
4.0,"Fit, quality and weight of fabric are great but neck line way too low and bra shows.  What a pity, would have bought several."
4.0,It’s very stretchy & flattering
4.0,They stretch out so I wish I'd have gotten the smaller size (kept the 10) They've got the cutest paisley print on them.
4.0,"This is a really cute bag! I was looking for something that is really classy, clean, and simple for work and this is perfect. Other people have mentioned that their bags have been packaged incorrectly and it's made their bag folded and creased. I didn't have this problem- they just put the bag in a big box without folding it (not sure if they've fixed that for good now). The smaller straps are too small to carry it on your shoulder so if you're looking for that kind of bag, this isn't it. It's a true satchel bag, or you have to just carry it in your hand. It stands up on its own and maintains its shape so well- almost too well, as it is a little stiff, but I'm sure as I use it more that won't be the case. Other people have said the smell is bad, but mine doesn't smell at all. It's incredibly cute and looks 100% designer worthy, but for a much better price!"
4.0,"Great graphics, ordered an XL but it fits like a Large."
4.0,Disappointed that I did not recieve the designer box that was pictured. But my daughter LOVES THOSE SHOES. Looking to buy more styles for her.
4.0,Love it. Many complements. Only 4 stars  Because I had to take it to a watch shop to be fitted. The tool did not work.
4.0,"This dress is Beautiful, but the the sizing was off and was too small.  Was so sorry I had to return it."
4.0,Cute dress.  Nothing fancy.  Very functional.
4.0,"Fine product for the price.<br />NOT see through, even in full sunlight I do not need to wear a slip with this.<br />The waist is a little high (right under boobs) and the boob area is a little snug when wearing a supportive bra.<br />Racer back is pretty wide and almost completely covers my very large-backed bra.<br />Hasn’t faded or thinned after a couple months. Would recommend as a classic casual black maxi."
4.0,"Good band, no pins"
4.0,"These clip-ons blocked 80% of visible light so they are good for medium light conditions. I personally thought they blocked too little light for the bright sunlight we get up at 7000 feet. However, I bought them because I wanted a trial run before I invested $200 in a pair of prescription sunglasses. Despite the fact I thought the blocked too little light they did the trick and convinced me that yes indeed I did want a pair of prescription sunglasses, so they served their purpose. Compared to my new glasses (which block 90% of visible light) these clip-on are a wan imitation but then they also cost only 10% of the price.<br /><br />Overall, I recommend these clip-on shades but if you're serious about your eyes put the money down for a real pair. You won't regret it."
4.0,I love this style it was a little tight though
4.0,"The only thing is that the calf is not as wide as I'd hoped - my husband has very large calves and they don't come up all the way. After he's worn them for a while, they roll down a bit and cause dents in his legs. The feet fit well. The socks are working to control the swelling in his feet and lower legs. Could be wider in the calf though."
4.0,"I need to hem mine at least 2-3 inches, as it's too long. The fabric is nice and soft though."
4.0,Cute. Head hole/hood a little smaller than expected. Zipper is closer to baby’s face than I’d like but it’s a cute coat!
4.0,"This denim crossbody bag is soft, lightweight and comfortable to wear.  The only change I would recommend is to make the side pockets have the same depth as the bag itself.  That change would make it a 5 star bag."
4.0,"I am male.  Key case came on time.  A tiny bit harder to close than my last case,  but it holds the keys more securely."
4.0,"Fast delivery but just in a bubble envelope.  The &#34;etching&#34; seems more like it was screen printed on but it still goes well w/the watch I bought.  Oh and for a size 10, it seems a TAD bigger."
4.0,"This is the perfect laptop bag.  Just the right amount of compartments to keep things secure and maintain a slim profile.  I particuarly like the double zipper of each compartment, enabling you to open things top center, which is always secure when carrying passports, keys, etc."
4.0,Shirt was a little small - go one size up from what you normally wear.  Overall great shirt and buy!
4.0,"Order size medium cuz my regular size large was not available. This skirt is VERY tight and long. I had it all the way up to under my boobs and it still went all the way down to my calves (I'm 5'4""). Overall it looks good and can be very flattering with the right outfit. (Sorry could not get a better picture)."
4.0,"Easy to put on, and fits just right! Lenses are a little to dark."
4.0,I wish the scoop neck was as low as in the picture.  It comes up a bit higher than I prefer.  But overall a decent buy.
4.0,Beautiful and fun but a bit smaller in size. I usually order large or extra large but this runs a bit small
4.0,"These are definitely heavy earrings, so wear them with the sturdier backs with the clear round discs for support. They are beautiful though and even during COVID I wear them around the house and for work - I want to look a little put together for Zoom meetings!  They are solid earrings that are beautiful and fun too!  They do come in a nice little box so would be a great gift!"
4.0,Love it shapes my body and slit is nice
4.0,Pretty bag. Sets off some security alarms.
4.0,"A little too big for my neck, so it sags in front. The necklace, not my neck. It's a little loose. Not me, the necklace."
4.0,They are well made and fit nicely. Not covered in grease and well polished. I have had to polish metal from other more expensive suppliers. Overall good purchase.
4.0,"Like the padded, wide straps with front coverage."
4.0,"was very nice, only bad thing is that it smelled had to clean it really good"
4.0,Cute little wallet exactly as described.
4.0,These are cute! Quite a big larger than I was expecting so be sure to double check those measurements. They aren't quite as light as you'd expect either.
4.0,A Tad bit small but is very cute and well worth the price
4.0,Bought this for me niece because she loves Ariel. It is absolutely perfect.
4.0,The dress was so pretty but I ordered a medium and really needed like an extra small. It had way too much fabric. I love loose fitting dresses but this was just way too much. The overall material and color of the dress was perfect and it wasn't see-through. I am 5'4' and 145 with a 34C. I hope this helps.
4.0,"I was going to buy the buy the KS138 (which is this one just black) and when I did it suddenly was unavailable. So i rushed around looking for another that would make my husband happy. So I picked this one because it was the same as the one he wanted just white. The shipping was going to take 17-28 days though :/<br />So I had to pay a crazy extra shipping fee to get it here before Christmas. But even when paying that amount I was still saving as the normal retail price is over $70 (which I can make back by selling one blanket), so to me it was worth spending the extra. And my husband will agree when he unwraps this absolutely gorgeous watch on Christmas day. The pictures do them no justice, much better looking in person. Also I love the weight of it, it was packaged with care, and is just a sleek and stylish watch.<br />Thank you for getting it to me so quick and in such well packaged conditions."
4.0,"Material is a little thin and average quality, but cute for a casual Halloween look. I wear a size 5. 36C bust"
4.0,"These are perfect for everyday wear and are not too small like some “hugging” earrings.  The only reason I did not rate a 5 star was that the stem that goes through your earlobe and the receiving hole on the earring itself could be a closer fit in order to assure that you don’t lose an earring while brushing your hair, changing clothing, etc."
4.0,Wasn’t to bad for the price paid.
4.0,Nice necklace! Made of nice material and looks like it is pictured except the size of the charm. It’s not huge but I wanted something a few sizes smaller.
4.0,"Love this bag. Was looking for this style for a long time. Love the Matt and Nat bags because they vegan and also light weight. I carry enough in my purse that I don’t need the actual purse to weigh a bunch as well. The only thing I would’ve liked more, is more inside pockets (there’s only two small ones) and maybe a lighter lining."
4.0,I love the design of the hoodie and worth the buy but for a 3x it fits more like an XL.
4.0,"We work in construction and and trying out various anti-fog sprays. We see a wide variety of results. The variations can be because of the individual; type of glasses or shield they are wearing; and the varying weather conditions. This product is one of the best we have tried across the board. Thanks for a solution for our eye protection in these cold, COVID days!"
4.0,"Love it! Fits perfect, really soft material and it arrived on time."
4.0,Never been one to wear rompers but this one is comfy and cute.
4.0,"I do really like it, but it’s a bit big. My waist is 26 inches and I wish there was a slightly smaller option."
4.0,Cute but runs a bit small
4.0,Very cute!!  Runs small - order next size up.
4.0,"So.....I do make sure that I read all reviews, pictures and comments. I'm glad I did because it really was helpful by this product running small! With that being said I still wasn't sure about the fitting but I tried it anyways, lol. I purchased the 4x(my size 14) in blue. The color received was as shown and the 4x fit me perfect. I think I could've did a 3x but then it really would have been tight in my thighs. I had enough room in the thighs w/4x...and I have some big thighs Kmsl. I'm 5,51/2 and weigh 198 with small waist. What I can say is that the elastic belt was wayyyyy to big so I cut it and tied it cute.😉 I really didn't need it but I made it useful. I bought this swimsuit for my vacation to Florida and received so many compliments. Hope this help😁"
4.0,Perfect for  my work.  No  more making  my tie every time I go to  work.  Fits just right and saves time. I  may buy a few more.
4.0,The other one I bought at the same time is lasting so well I can't say I have tried this one. I'm certain though it will do as well.
4.0,I got so many compliments on these and I love them too! But they definitely aren’t lightweight. I stretched my earlobes several years back and they haven’t healed 100%. I can still wear these but not for long because they pull on my ears.
4.0,Nothing is wrong with it only thing I didn’t like was how the string looked other than that everything felt just fine
4.0,"After looking at the sizing chart I bought a 3x. I’m NEVER a 3x, but I had time to send it back if it didn’t fit and the fit was perfect (I usually wear a 16 or XL for reference) so pay attention to the included sizing chart. Also, I’m short (5’3”) and this dress hits me mid-thigh (just like the model in the picture). I like it for the look I’m going for, but taller girls may expose more than they bargain for!"
4.0,This dress was perfect with the exception of the shoulder straps. They aren’t adjustable and they needed to be tightened a bit. But I got plenty of compliments and it looked gorgeous on!!
4.0,"great for workouts, or travel.  cons: thumb easily punched a hole through the sock trying to put it on."
4.0,"Very nice, a little heavier than I hoped for. Washes great."
4.0,My daughter loved the shirt.  Quality seems good.
4.0,"Haven't actually used this yet.  It arrived promptly, seems well made and exactly as shown and described.  I think the price is a bit high for this type of item.  But, since a mesh (or plastic) bag is the only type being allowed into so many venues these days, it only makes sense to get one and to try to get a quality item."
4.0,"I don't know a whole lot about jewelry, but my mom decided to buy me some diamond earrings for my birthday. I thought it would be nice to have a matching necklace... needless to say, the stone in this necklace is about half the size of the earrings my mom bought :) i still wear this necklace every day, but i did have to get a bigger chain. This chain is ideal for a child to wear, not a grown woman.<br />But like i said, I love this necklace and I still wear it every day... Just keep in mind it is rather small"
4.0,A little big but super cute just like the picture
4.0,These gloves are well made my only draw back is the elastic around the wrist is too tight. I might have to cut it inside some kind of way so my son get his hand in it better
4.0,"Works well, however the head curve is a little weak.  Hope it lasts."
4.0,It fits snuggly and is a perfect accessory for holiday fun shot. My Santa loved it!
4.0,"Arrived just like the picture. Cheap belt holders that may rip around the jeans. Price needs to be lowered. Overall looks great, fits good."
4.0,"Got for a Halloween costume, did the job. No complaints!"
4.0,"I really like this piece. I got it for a trip to the Cayman Islands that I am going on over the holidays. It's better than expected and can fit a wide amount of body types because it is quite adjustable. I am very skinny and very tall and I was worried that it would be too big for me but its not. I might have to take a couple links off the neck because its a little long there but its no big deal. It seems to be high quality and durable. The chain is pretty thick as well and I cannot see the chain breaking easily. The reason I gave it four stars was because one of the stones (a teardrop center one) was missing and I can't seem to find it anywhere. If I can find it, I will glue it back on."
4.0,"Comfort level is great, fits good.... Cooling? Um, where? I was just as hot in this as others, and never felt a cooling anything."
4.0,"The fabric is cheap, but the dress is super cute."
4.0,Really cute hat for my three year old. It’s adjustable so she can grow into it.
4.0,dope got it on a great deal!!
4.0,"Bought this for my husband, he likes it, said he wish it was just a inch bugger, says its a little short.<br />But he is wearing it and likes it, seems to be doing the job."
4.0,"Great quality t-shirt, but CUT SHORT doesn’t even fully hit hip. Otherwise fits as expected. Would have given 5 stars if the shirt was the correct length."
4.0,Very pretty but big!
4.0,They’re cute but the fit is a little small. I have a full round face.
4.0,Love it!  Soo comfortable!!!
4.0,It was a bit smaller than I expected the bristles are a little bit loose it definitely cleaned my hat and for the price it is worth it
4.0,"This is a waist trimmer belt intended to create a sauna effect during workouts. It is a generous one size that is held with a large velcro pad. I have used this while doing house work and walking, but not for heavy workouts. This belt does create a warming effect and increases sweating. I haven't used it long enough to see effects (will update review with effectiveness at a later date). My only complaint is I would like it to be offered in a size for a longer torso and be able to tighten a bit more."
4.0,It’s pretty and fits nice .
4.0,Fabric is fine and fleece lining is comfortable.
4.0,Loved these boxers. No front fly was a bummer
4.0,Fits good just be sure to wear undergarments with it and your good to go
4.0,Fits just like I thought it would.
4.0,"Cant wait to wear this out on the town!! Dress material is nice quality not thin and sheer, thicker. Good stretch to accommodate curves! A few dangling strings but not damaging to the dress. Ruching is strange and strings may be more easily adjusted while dress is off. I got a size 2x"
4.0,"Cute bag, holds more than I thought it would"
4.0,They're warm.  There's not a whole lot you can write about gloves.  One thing that's really nice (and not really indicated in the picture) is that the part of the glove at the wrist will actually roll down pretty far on your arm and help keep the cold out of your sleeve.
4.0,"Love these. Being that they are not silk (not at this price) they are a little thick, but I was in the need for a few solid color ties and at this price, they are great. Very good quality."
4.0,Great sunglasses that lasted me 5 months before braking. They did not come with a pouch either. Much darker than Oakleys.
4.0,She LOVES these shoes. They are interesting to set the different lighting combinations.
4.0,I like the hat.  The brim is a good width and bends in a flattering manner.
4.0,son loved it but material tears easy.
4.0,"Nice Wallet.  It was a little thicker than I thought, but very functional."
4.0,"I got this top in brown for the fall season in a size S. The length and fit were pretty good, and the texture definitely gave it a cute ""sweater"" cable- knit look without actually being a heavy sweater. The only thing is the material is pretty thin and a little scratchy, so it probably won't be an absolute go-to for me. Still very cute though :)"
4.0,"One of the things that I love about summer is being in the water and just sitting around relaxing be a pool or lake. Being a thicker girl there are times especially if I am somewhere that has a lot of people that I don’t feel comfortable being in my bathing suit cause of looky loos and being a little self-conscious about the extra pounds that I carry around with me.<br /><br />  First thing is first, now I know that I am a bigger girl and that my suits run a little bigger but to be able to get a suit that fit me I had to get a 7X….I usually wear a XL, now I know that this is a different sizing measurement but that already made me sad and made my heart hurt. Once I got over the fact that I had to order such a bigger size everything else was great. One of the things that I have a harder time with when it comes to nothing suits is the mid-section. Bathing suits are made to be worn tight so I am usually wearing a towel or shorts to cover up that “larger” portion of my body. This suit that wasn’t needed, with the mesh like material that is on the suit it covers enough of my mid-section that I feel comfortable enough that I can go without a cover-up. Another problem that I have with bathing suits is that I have a shorter torso so some bathing suits seem a little large when it comes to length, this suit seemed to be almost perfect in that area. The straps of the suit didn’t fall off nor did they dig into my shoulders making it uncomfortable (the last thing I want to do is be uncomfortable when I am trying to relax.) Being a bigger chested girl I always worry about how the cups of bathing suits will fit me. The cups fit perfectly and didn’t cut the circulation off to the girls all while still supporting them. The cut of this bathing suit is great cause the bottom portion of the bathing suit looks like a pair of boy shorts, this is great for someone like me that wants that “bigger” portion of her body to be nice and covered.<br /><br />  I really do enjoy this bathing suit. The way that the bathing suit is built almost can be mistaken for a shorter dress. If you are one that wants to be a little bit more covered up while still having a good time in or by the water, then this would be perfect. The suit does great in the water and dries as quickly as all the other bathing suits that I have tried on. I like that all the important parts are covered up while still letting me enjoy the good times. This would be great for anyone that is a little more conservative at the beach like me.<br /><br />  I received this product for free in exchange for my true and unbiased opinion. The opinions expressed in this review are mine and mine alone. Nobody or nothing has influenced my opinion. I in no way shape or form have a relationship with this dealer."
4.0,I ordered these for my husband when he ruined his expensive RX sun glasses.  He likes that he can flip them up out of th way but complains he can't see well when he moves into shadow.  He said the same about his RX glasses!  I would order these for him again.
4.0,This backpack is amazing. It's confusing getting the battery pack set up. It DOESN'T come with a portable charger so if you want your backpack to charge you device get one. I recommend.
4.0,"Really very pretty, just to big.. To heavy"
4.0,Great sub protection but stems feel really flimsy. The lenses are also getting some weird markings around the edge that Peppers brand typically don't experience. It's making me wonder if these are knock offs
4.0,They help cushion my feet on my daily 2-!/2 mile walks.
4.0,They fit a little small but overall I love them good quality and color
4.0,Comfortable & fits well. Thought it was supposed to have pockets though and it does not.
4.0,"It's pretty good! The material isn't cheap, and everything fit! My only complaints are that the clasps holding together the outer piece come apart really easily, and the gold piece on the hat almost fell off. I was able to fix it with hot glue, but other than that it's pretty decent."
4.0,Too much material in the waist that after I tighten the string it looks frumpy. Had to alter the waist a bit smaller. For reference I'm 32-27-37
4.0,It was a really awesome costume except the dome is a little small
4.0,The fit was a little tight for me.
4.0,Runs size small! But nice looking.
4.0,"as long as my wife likes it, its good..lol"
4.0,"good pair of socks... thick, comfortable, and breathable!! I love these socks so will be getting more colors even tho they dont have a heck of a lot to choose from! I got mine in the violet color which I must say is my favorite color! I received this item at a discount for my honest opinion!"
4.0,"Very comfy, washes wonderfully."
4.0,It was a little long.
4.0,"For me, I love this watch. It's easy to read.  Only drawback is the alarm isnt long enough, nor is it very loud."
4.0,"My Daughter liked it, and that's all that matters!"
4.0,"Great item, runs a little small or my butt got a little bigger. But great item"
4.0,I'm 110lb and 5'4 and it was a bit long and the waist is too big but i like it
4.0,"Good quality, I’m 5’4 130lbs and this fits good but it’s a tad long I ordered a Medium but I think I could have gotten away with a small. Other than that I love it!"
4.0,Love the look of this jogger. My husband wore it for the first time yesterday and it was very flattering and comfortable. Only thing I had hoped for was something just a little thicker but I’m sure these will be great in the warmer months.
4.0,Super cute and simple necklace. I particularly like ones like this where the pendant is along the chain rather than hanging on it since it makes the hook for the back of the necklace stay in place better.
4.0,Precio
4.0,"This was a pretty dress. Since it only came in S, M, L, etc..., we ordered a medium based on my daughter's measurements. (She was a 6 in two other numerical size dresses we bought.) The medium was just a little big. It would have worked, but the color wasn't great on her. She has somewhat darker (olive-toned) caucasian skin, and it seemed like her skin tone didn't have enough contrast with the dress. I think it would have been prettier on someone with significantly darker or lighter skin. Still, though, it was a pretty dress."
4.0,"Nice jacket and good quality, but too big. I reordered a smaller size."
4.0,"I would have given this 3.5 stars were that an option. I have two of these in black and they're perfect, they get five stars. They're slimming and come a couple inches past my butt, so I wear them with leggings and boots, and they're easily some of my favorite clothing items. I got the charcoal one and it doesn't fit the same. It's not quite as slimming and not nearly as long, it maybe comes halfway over my butt. It makes a good undershirt, but it's not one I can wear like I wear the others. So if you're wanting something nice and long, the black ones are perfect, charcoal - not so much"
4.0,So excited for this robe! It’s really hard to find cute stuff in extended sizes so when I found this I snatched it up. Very plush on the white parts (only around the openings) which I like because robes usually make me too hot. The thinner gray fabric is also very soft. Unfortunately it does run a tad small so size up if you can. I’m usually a 3-4XL so got the 4 and it barely closes in front. Also has some loose hem strings right in front you can see in the picture. Pockets are decent size (iPhone 8plus sticks out of the top) and hood is massive as you can see in the pic lol wish some of that hood fabric went to better use through the body but alas I’m keeping it anyway 🤷🏼‍♀️
4.0,"Obsessed with this top! It's so cute and exactly what I was looking for. I won't use the bottoms. They fit well, good coverage, I just prefer high waist. Would definitely buy again! I usually wear 36D, 6/8 jeans and bought a large."
4.0,I only wear NM360's
4.0,"Not sure why it's saying I bought an XX-Large. I bought a Small.<br />I'm a M or L in most things but this in brand can apparently go either way with an S or an M.<br />The 'S' in this is nice if you're not planning to really move but if I wanted to wear to an office party i'd definitely need an M.<br />I am considering getting this in a few more colors maybe.  I'm 5'5"" and 36C chest, 29"" waist, 39ish hips and I have a touch of a backside but not exactly a donk. If I walked too much or too fast the 'S' would definitely ride up lol but besides that it's pretty flattering on me but again I did size down a litte smaller than normal.<br />The 'S' isn't tight on me tho however my caveat is about the lentgh. Even at shortish 5'5"" and wearing ankle boots with barely 1"" chunky heel this fall like mid-thigh. If I wanted this to fall just above the top of my knee I'd def get 'M' in this. The price goes up and down on this....I paid just shy of $16 (with taxes) when I got this....i'm ok with that but I can see it can be as low at $12/13ish before taxes.  I might get 2 more colors at that price."
4.0,"Very difficult to get on without deforming the sock. Even with lubricant, they just don't stretch like the original Oakley part. Once I got them on, it left one of the socks stretched out and slightly deformed. Sure, I admit that if I had to do this again, I would know better how to tug/push on the sock to get it to slide on better, but there were no instructions or anything included with the part, so the first sock was a bit of a test subject to determine the best process. my recommendation is to take it slow, use plenty of lubricant, and slide it on easy. if you get stuck, go even easier, because you can't just slide em off and try again."
4.0,"Very nice shirt, did fit a tad big but still very wearable. Was pleased"
4.0,"I got these to wear to Mickey's Not So Scary Halloween Party at WDW.  I knew I would only be using them once a year at best so I figured cheap was better.  Plus, the official ears from Disney Parks are too stinking tight and heavy!  These ears were very cheap and filmsy but much more comfortable.  They stayed on my head for the duration of the entire party (8 hours for me) with no pain.  They are basically held together with hot glue, though, so I was very careful not to let them get wet or blown around on the rides.  Overall, very worth it."
4.0,"Overall the dress is comfortable, the material is decent quality. However, the cut is boxy, and feels a bit frumpy. Great for lounging and around the house but probably won’t wear it out as the cut is unflattering. I’m 5’5”, 120lbs and I ordered small, if xsmall was an option it may fit a bit better overall."
4.0,Came sooner than expected! Pretty ring! Not gold or silver. But exactly as i expected. Great costume jewelry... Large stone if you were wondering. Too big for some.
4.0,Light and comfy. A little baggy but the length is good.I think that's how sweatpants are.
4.0,"Great value! I've bought them in every color. Very stretchy - will fit any size.  Adjustable straps are slightly itchy on my back, but not bad. Nice and thin for wearing underneath clothes.  Wouldn't wear by themselves. No shelf bar."
4.0,"This is a good product, is what the promo text promises, and is well made. I found it ideal for travel as it fits into a compact space yet is large enough to be useful.  It is four instead of five stars because the shoehorn is a bit cheesy - a metal one would make this a perfect kit. Note that is does not contain polish - that you supply - but I thought that was an advantage that allows you to choose your polish."
4.0,These are great for casual days...not quite dressy enough for evenings but very comfortable and can get wet and this doesn't damage them...my kind of shoe!
4.0,"However, it really doesn’t look real. It looks a bit plastic-ie. Otherwise it looks like the picture."
4.0,I am fan of this brand.  They are well made using alu/mag frames so they feel sturdy but not heavy and not cheap plastic.  Lenses are quite nice and look to be the part much like more expensive brands.<br /><br />Fut and feel excellent  with a mirrored exterior finish.
4.0,These are very nice glasses and come with a  case. Worth the $.
4.0,These make a nice little gift to give to friends. I gave them to both of my daughters and they really liked them....the price is right too.
4.0,"Excellent material, I order one size up, I use Large but I order XL. I am 5.9 ft. The zipper was installed on the left, but it works. Nice color."
4.0,"Runs small!  Unless I've grown 2 sizes bigger since social distancing started (which could be, sadly).  Will return.  The style and fabric were nice."
4.0,I like them and they should work.  I like them because 5 out of 6 are 3.5” long in length so it keeps the opening closer.
4.0,My husband is usually a medium but I got the large based on reviews and they fit perfectly.  Only wish I could buy more but they are sold out in the 2 styles of 5 packs.  I wish I knew when they might be back in stock or how to get the first shipment
4.0,I liked the size fairly large plenty of room for most of my stuff I'd like maybe a couple more storage pockets well built if you don't pay attention you can put more stuff than you can carry give it a thumbs up
4.0,"Ordered the small, was wayyyy too big in the waist area! Wish they would have fit , however, seems a little bit pricey for the quality"
4.0,"The packaging, polishing cloth, gift gag,etc make the a very easy gift to present.  The chain was a bit thin, I thought it would be more sturdy.  My wife loved it."
4.0,"You should be a shame of yourselves for selling this crappy junk. Look like it comes out of the bubble gum machine in that round plastic bubble for . 25 cent. Shame, shame, shame for taking advantage of people at a time such as this! YOU HAVE NO INTEGRITY!"
4.0,Measurements in the chest and waist are
4.0,Loved the bracelet..just a little large for our daughter and doesn’t adjust down but she loves it too much so we will make it work.  Perfect for you Harry Potter fan!
4.0,I bought this as a gift and he loved it.
4.0,"I mainly bought this for the skirt/suspenders as I made the armor pieces (3D printed) so here's a breakdown<br />Skirt: Serviceable, I bought a large and my hips are 37.5"" and it fit perfectly no pinching or muffin top. I have thick thighs/butt so it does ride up a bit so make sure to check your rear for exposure. Sits at a good height.<br />Suspenders: Look good, same pleather material as the skirt so it looks cohesive, the belt holds up the skirt's side pockets which look great and the detail with the metal parts is good.<br />Socks: Surprisingly long, I am mostly leg so it's very surprising for any sock to reach mid thigh on me. They do squish in so it was giving sausage and it would 100% roll down without sock glue on it.<br />Arm sleeves: Too short for me, would suggest sock glue to keep these in place there's not much squeeze<br />Armor pieces/gloves: I made my own but even if I didn't- straight to the trash. It looks like a grade school art project gone wrong<br />Hair tie: Comes with the red hair tie for a wig! Happily surprised to get it I didn't expect it<br />Tops: Tossed the black one as I'm wearing a sports bra with it, keeping the white it needs to be ironed/steamed but will work<br /><br />TLDR If you're after the base pieces that're a pain to make get it, if you need the armor you will need something else. There are a lot of minute details missing but this is $80 for the whole outfit, final fantasy details are going to run you $200 for the skirt alone."
4.0,Pretty decent robe for the pricing. I would purchase the robe again.
4.0,the pins in this band were awful! took them out and put the originals in and it snapped in easily. love the apple style band.
4.0,Are similar but more of a textured rubber. Very easy to replace and feel great. Hardest part is getting the body apart. The triggers are fragile. Watch YouTube video first.
4.0,It works but my arm is turning green and the paint is falling off.
4.0,"Excellent designing idrea. Very creative and feminine,yet comfortable. Sizing needs adaptations for final release. Western sizing is as follows. XXX is size 0-2. XS is 2-4. S is 6-8. M is 8-10. L is 12-14. XL is 16-18. XXL is 20-22. XXXL is 24-26 and so on. The measurements are closer together on smaller sizes and more generous as sizes increase. The g garment is unique enough that a light weight to see if penne velvet can be used for a winter weight. You could also try a good on the top. Very cute and wears no ely. Hang to dry."
4.0,"These glasses are just what I wanted.  They are super clear polarized view with readers on the bottom.  They are very light weight, fit my small face well and the only reason I gave 4 instead of 5 is they are so light weight that I worry about duribility."
4.0,I was nervous the white tee would be too yhin and was pleasantly surprised by the quality. Sizing was running on the big side. It is always hard to know what size to order. I wear a 16 usually i ordered XL. Large would have been perfect.
4.0,"La camisa, es un modelo super bello, pero el tamaño es demasiado chico. Lo bueno que soy delgada pero de igual forma se me quedaría muy rápido la camisa."
4.0,It's a beautiful dress. Its fits like a dream
4.0,I liked the dress but didn’t have no definition the elastic in the back was loose<br />I just added a jacket and it was great for polka dots day
4.0,"This skirt is so very cute! I love the Sesame Street characters on it, and the elastic waist. I was hoping it would be a tad longer though. I like midi skirts to hit at my lower calves, not slightly below my knees. I would've purchased a large instead of a medium for more length, but it sold out. My height is 5'4, waist 31 inches. The only thing that could make this better is if it had pockets. I love it!"
4.0,I enjoy having different color lenses for my Oakley Juliets as they also provide different viewing perks.  Attempting to describe the differences would not be my strong suit as they are often subtle but also different to different users.  What I can say is I am pleased with the products appearance.  The blue is a bold blue color and using them is a good experience.  The lenses are not too dark and are closer to the original Oakley lenses than most other lenses I've tried.
4.0,Cute dress. Really casual and comfortable.
4.0,a little large for a newborn. Fits better after 6 weeks.
4.0,"Bought a 2x. Im 218 and 5'4"". Fit well. Very soft like costume material. Inside lining is white, so stretching too much (is. Squats) will show white and i could also see my underwear pattern if I looked hard enough. Semi see through when doing squats. Other than that they are comfy and look nice."
4.0,Ordered 2-3 years and it fits more like 12-18 months.
4.0,This is a nice sweater. It's not as big as I thought it would be and the color is a little different- not as bright of an ivory as I thought. But it still is nice :)
4.0,"I wasnt really concerned about the quality of the outside of boot, as you see I covered them in crystals! However, for the price -  very nice and I would have worn them as is if I didnt have a “vision” I was creating.<br />Pretty comfy- I did wear them about 11 hours straight for my sons wedding, my feet hurt at end of night. I dont think because of boot, but because of time on my feet walking around a farm!"
4.0,Fit all required documentation
4.0,Son muy lindas lo único que esa costura interior hace doler al caminar ojalá mi pie se acostumbre el talle es perfecto
4.0,"I like it, but I’m surprised at how it fits. I’m not a large woman and I got this big on purpose. It doesn’t fit me large. I wish it was longer and bigger."
4.0,"I love the fit . I just had to alter the length because it is too long. However, the bodice fit well."
4.0,I love these little golden keys. I used them to make wine glass charms. They are really sturdy and come with a variety of sizes with the largest being no more than two stacked coins (Quarters). The small one are too cute. I would definitely buy them again.
4.0,Colors are true to the picture.. but it is definitely not 800 beads.. maybe 100... It's the regular large pack of beads you would get from your local beauty supply store.
4.0,"Great fit, daughter loves it.  Goes with those tank tops or strapless dresses so she can wear them to school."
4.0,It's really cute. I fell in love with the thin chain. It's very delicate and long enough. It's a really cute gift for girlfriend. Im not sure if it'll get dark with sweat or water tho
4.0,I love this! I will wear it with pride to show how strong and brave I was as a young lady who proudly served in the Navy.
4.0,"Just what I was looking for.... Goes with gold or silver jewelry....  Easy to put on and take off.  Had to have quite a few links taken out in order for it to fit, and I am an average size person.  All in all, great purchase."
4.0,"Really nice dress, I’m 5’9 and it covered my feet which is what I wanted, it is see-through."
4.0,"Comfortable, good quality, thicker than many no-shows -- pleased with these socks."
4.0,"Got this suit in green and black, it is wonderful. It is so bright and has a flattering fit. The only reason I give 4 stars is due to the cup padding. I hate having to fix it every time I go swimming. So I cheated and sew it in. It really makes the suit perfect if you do that. You don't have to worry about shifting or getting a crease across you ladies if you don't see it folded and the crease sets in."
4.0,"Beautiful, I haven't taken it off."
4.0,"The length was fine, but the width was too wide."
4.0,Beautiful color and comfortable fit.
4.0,I didn't think it would fit and be so much fun
4.0,"Theres nothing technically wrong with this top. It is a medium weight material, not thin. The print is larger than it appears be in the pictures online, but that could just be me. The quality is nice, well made, but the shape does nothing for me. I am 158 lbs @ 5'3"", measuring 36D/DD-34-43, and I bought a Large."
4.0,Nice color and cut. I just should have gone larger size
4.0,"This was not a bad quality item, for a smaller person it works great (I have since given it to my best friend) and looks really sexy on. I am a size 16 and ordered an xLarge and it did not fit at all! It wasnt made wrong, I just dont have the body to make this piece look good. You have to be either very small, or large but in very good shape. It was a really pretty pink, and would be great for someone smaller. Bigger girls beware :)<br /><br />I received this product for free in return for my unbiased and honest review."
4.0,"The top is cute. I ordered a medium at the suggestion of others but it’s too large. It’s very long in the back too so if you aren’t very tall, it will completely cover your back side."
4.0,Sizing is a real challenge with this company. An M is too large and an S is too small. I am fit and should not have this problem. Only after ordering various sizes to conduct proper comparisons I found a decent fit.
4.0,"I was actually surprised that these came up past my thighs. They got decently. I have a rather large butt, and the pants at least cover it completely.  I wore then while out walking, and they move well, and are very comfortable.  Looking forward to finding out what kind of results I get!"
4.0,Very flattering in the mid-section. True to fit
4.0,Very cute dress although the pockets make the shape kinda awkward
4.0,"Love the product. Excellent quality. The instruction booklet was hard to read, super small print, and colors that don't show up well on the background. That is my only problem with my glolights"
4.0,"Made out of nice quality fabric and fit true to size. However, I would've like a little bit more compression. The lightness of the material did improve breathability and air flow so that's a plus."
4.0,I love this purse so much. The seller went above and beyond expectations to get product to me in the best amount of time during a hurricane that shut airports down. The only thing that was a little disappointing is a few of the studded rhinestones came off after first use. It wasn't a bid deal to me though.
4.0,"color is a little off, but could be due to screen resolution. everything else is as expected"
4.0,"This headband is pretty and comfortable to use.  I've received tons of compliments on it.  I guess the models in the photos have really small heads as there's no way I could see myself being able to double wrap this headband around my head.  Anyway, I've been careful with it so hopefully it will hold up over time."
4.0,This comfy sleepwear was perfect enough to wear around the house and family . Super soft and feels so good to sleep in
4.0,"I like this shirt. I am a large, I bought a large and it fits me. It's not flowy but it fits nice."
4.0,"My wife's work has hash florescent lights that hurt her eyes after extended periods so we got these to help shield her eyes and we read that Pink lenses work better for headaches so we got these to try with that. They are just red colored on the outer part of the lens though, they back just being normal shades but they did help her eyes from the lights."
4.0,"Nice cute little thing, however the leather rope does not do justice because it's so stiff it does not let the light weight pendant settle on the neck, chain needs to be rethought"
4.0,fits great and comfy as long as you take the inserts out that dont fit and feel weird.
4.0,"The size is very nice. Clarity is great. It is put together really well, it's everything the advertisement stated it would be in the description, the chain is just the right length and it is priced right for a Christmas gift. It is impressive enough to be a family heirloom. The only reason I gave it a four is  its gold plated. I would not have minded at all, paying more for the necklace had it been pure 14k gold. Hope they come out with a pure gold version."
4.0,"I love this style of bracelet, but I do wish the detail on this one was a little larger. Still very pretty, though!"
4.0,"Durable and pretty. I like that even though these aren't expensive, they haven't broken and I have worn them daily for at least two months."
4.0,Love how it fits & awesome pockets definitely with a one year old much needed.
4.0,"Light, fits as expected. Perfect for work or dress it up for evening."
4.0,"I liked the  quality, better than what I expected.<br />Definitely would recommend."
4.0,First click belt. Was getting tired of conventional belts & wanted something new. Once I got the hang of putting it on it became effortless. The belt has a split in a seam & the buckle has some chips in the paint from dropping it. For some reason it doesn't seem as large as advertised.  I'm a 56-58 waist. Maybe a bigger size will do?
4.0,Champagne elegance at a beer price.
4.0,Nice top but runs a little small.
4.0,My daughter only wore these a few time but they were super cute. Runs a bit small
4.0,Impressed by how it dresses up an outfit.
4.0,Works perfect for my 3 yr old.  Looks nice
4.0,"This dress is so cute!! After reading the other reviews, I was torn between ordering the 10 and 12, so I ended up ordering both.  The 10 fit perfectly in the skirt, but a little snug in the top; the 12 fit loose all over, and looked awkward since I was swimming in it.  I decided to keep the 10, and used it for my bachelorette party."
4.0,"Material was great, size was too small for XL"
4.0,Nice shirt! This is a pullover and not button up but I still love it.
4.0,"Very nice, true to color."
4.0,"It might be styled like this to be a bit baggy and loose, I still really like it a lot, but oddly, there are no strings attached to tighten the hood even though there are metal eyelets for one."
4.0,Looks professional and nice but it's pretty thick and tight.
4.0,"This dress is correct to description, I am a size 8 and ordered a medium. It fits nice, feels soft and comfortable. I just happen to see a woman at my bank wearing the same dress and she also loved it! I like it so much I may order another in a different color."
4.0,I wishh I knew how too keep the picks in place.
4.0,"I loved these glasses, they are so cute and better at blocking the sun than my more expensive name brand sunglasses. But they didn't last me very long. I maybe had them 2 months before the side snapped off. It probably just needed a screw, but I didn't want to have to fuss with them. I would buy them again though."
4.0,"Super cute, quality. But going to have to send back.  Size 6 too small for my 5 year old.  Usually wears a 6."
4.0,"Love the color, it fits the unit perfectly too. I would have given this 5 stars but after only 1 month the pattern is rubbing off in multiple places. So sad."
4.0,The material is a little thin but it's good for the price
4.0,Lenses were easy to change out. The sunblocking ability is great.
4.0,"These are cute. Slight discomfort the first time I had to pull the little chain through my ear piercing, but not horrible, just briefly uncomfortable the first time.<br />I wonder if a smaller chain would improve that."
4.0,I thought it had an active second hand but it is for the stop watch portion otherwise great watch for the money
4.0,"This is a very eye-catching ring and looks like you spent WAY more than $19.99 for it. The stone is a nice deep color with flecks of green and red fire, and the CZs are really sparkly. I also like the fact that the sterling is rhodium plated so that it matches my white gold and platinum jewelry."
4.0,Very pretty ring can't complain for the price I paid. :)
4.0,"Nice piece, they are truly highly polished as described, so if you prefer a natural silver look these may be too shiny for you..."
4.0,"It's very beautiful and delicate, going with just about any  color combination."
4.0,I like these and would order them again. They are very comfortable.  They are a little long .
4.0,"I love this suit! The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because the orange is WAY more neon than it appears in the picture. It’s like traffic cone neon orange, which actually turned out to look cute, but was not what I was expecting. It runs small, I am usually a medium (5’7”, 140lbs, B-cup) and I got a large and it fit perfectly."
4.0,It was a little darker then the picture showed but still nice.
4.0,Very cute! Nice quality. However it was difficult to fasten with longer nails. Also I am a heavier gal it barely fit around my ankle. I wore it for a short period after fastening it but had to take it off because it was too tight and it was leaving pitting on my skin.
4.0,True to fit.
4.0,"I admittedly have a very comfortable bike saddle anyway, but these shorts make a difference when taking long-distance rides. They're flattering, not too bulky, and get the job done for the right price."
4.0,"Nice dress, good quality and comfortable."
4.0,Not as bright a color as I was wanting but they are still very nice.
4.0,"I prefer these much more than typical tights....much, much more. Other kinds cut into my waist and are so uncomfortable. Unwearable, and I'm an average size. The only small downside is that it still has a bit of elastic around the waist, not just lace, and it can get a little sweaty. Other than that I highly recommend for those like me who can copy with the typical tights."
4.0,I did not know they would be so high. They look as if they are hanging unless you wear them tight. The stone is pretty and clear though so I will gift them.
4.0,"Finally! My shirts stay neatly tucked in and my socks stay pulled up! My only issue with these guys is that one of the clips on one of the shirt stays keeps slipping off my shirts and there's really no way to fix this. I'll probably end up investing in a higher quality pair, but overall I'm happy I bought this pair because I didn't initially know if I'd like these, so they served as a sort of trial for me."
4.0,I normally wear an 8-10 in bottoms and a medium/large top. I followed the chart and ordered the XL (even though that's not my normal size) and it fits perfectly! I am a 34B and the top was not too big or small. My lower half is bigger than the top and I normally have to buy bigger bathing suit bottoms but I didn't have to for this one. It fits well and covers the parts I'm uncomfortable with. I also tried the top with a different not high waisted bottom and it looked fine. Cute pattern and you can't find a bathing suit set this cheap often
4.0,Love the set!
4.0,"It is light weight, comfortable and effectively block UV light to reduce eye stress, it has very slight yellow tint can be seen if you put it over a piece of white paper and this is normal. It has an minor issue, the coating is slightly reflective, when I put it on I see lightly fogged image especially in strong sunlight, normal use in the shade and indoor will not be a problem."
4.0,A little too stretchy for my lil one and the wrust area was big although the upper arm are fit perfectly
4.0,Nice for price sizes are great
4.0,Fit a little big on my grandson but he wears it over a shirt anyways. He loves it. He's 9yrs old
4.0,These work well and have a nice case to boot...happy with purchase...
4.0,"Adore this swim suit! Fit perfectly! Didn’t expect my butt cheeks to hang out as much as they do, it’s slightly higher cut. Love it though! I wore it to Hawaii!"
4.0,These sunglasses fit me perfect.
4.0,"Good quality and comfortable. I took my measurements according to the description given based on size and these are very large. For reference I would fit perfectly in an XL based on those measurements, but as soon as I tried them on they were at least a size larger. I’m keeping them because I’d like to have a pair of comfortable pants that I can wear as a cute outfit. Could be cute with a white tank tucked in."
4.0,"Watch is fairly easy to set up using phone. Can take a while for watch to reach correct time. Can’t program custom messages on watch, only presets. It’s great for reminders to take meds, hydrate, or for sleep schedules. The woman’s voice is clear, but mechanical. Not sure of battery life with hourly chime. Good watch for older person, as there’s only 2 buttons. Easy for caretaker to set up then give to patient. Can set up to 6 alarms. Band runs small, wouldn’t fit on large wrist. Very neat design for basic functionality."
4.0,Item runs a little small.  I need to return for larger size.  Very nice top.
4.0,Fabric rode a little but was comfortable none the less.
4.0,I like the colors that I chose.  But I will say it is hard for me to hit the tiny hole to screw the back on.  T J S
4.0,Way too big. Would like to exchange for a medium but don’t have a printer to print return label. Can you help me out .?
4.0,The color is a bit lighter than the picture shown but other than that seems to be good.
4.0,Didn’t realize it would be too short for me. I’m 5’4 and it was above my knees. Good dress but not for me
4.0,Was very gappy at the armpit but I took it in a little on each side and it was perfect after that! Cute got compliments on it.
4.0,I like the dress. It came down right at my knees where I wanted it to. I'm 5'6&#34; and ordered an xl. It had a slimming effect that I was looking for.
4.0,Beautiful.  Fast shipping.  Thank you.
4.0,"Slightly feminine looking, but does the trick!"
4.0,Cute and sparkly Earrings... but the pink pair came missing a stone (see pic.) Hoping the others don’t start losing stones. Will update if that happens.
4.0,"Plain and simple, so I added some jewels to match my dress for a wedding and everyone loved it. Took one star off because the chain is a little short, so doesn't work as a crossbody like I had wanted."
4.0,The stone was smaller than I expected. But the quality of the item is excellant.
4.0,"Looks good works great,."
4.0,Ok adjustable rings. My daughter is 10 so they will not last her long
4.0,Cute but very delicate. Make sure the person is she responsible.
4.0,I think the shoes are really cute and look adorable on my granddaughter.  She is so excited and that's what matters the most - the only reason I gave 4 stars is the price.  Given they are just jelly shoes/plastic basically the price is way too high in my opinion - but of course I paid it since I knew they'd make her so happy.
4.0,"Sturdy, cute design"
4.0,very cute with leggings
4.0,"A nice little novelty item, not high quality but for the price they are ok cufflinks. No gift box arrived with my pair of cufflinks (this could be due to a shipping error) so be for warned if you are planning this as a gift."
4.0,I really love it but I have to say the hat was too tight for my granddaughter should be made a bit larger
4.0,It's a bit small but it works for me.
4.0,The outside has an almost burlap feel while the inside is surprisingly soft. Material holds sewn on patches well. Size comes baggy.
4.0,"This back looks good. However, when it is open stuff keeps falling out sometimes because the front edge is small. I guess the design could have been better. Nevertheless, It has a lot of space to hold plenty of stuff."
4.0,I'm a scrub
4.0,"Worked well for a costume when my son was Simba in Lion King Jr play at school. Held up to about ten washes, no drying before it started fraying."
4.0,"Love the tights except while walking, they sparkle and fit great but they will snag if your legs touch at all!! I appreciate that the sparkles go all the way up but if I was not wearing some type of shorts under the dress I would have had holes all over from the knees up."
4.0,"First off, I love this case and I will order a few more for variety.  however, the case I got, although beautiful, looks nothing like the picture.  I am not even sure that it is the same wood.  it looks very pale compared to the image.  but I​ do still love it."
4.0,"Got this as a gift for my girlfriend for Valentine's and she absolutely loves it. Pearl and diamond are beautiful. The actual necklace part is a little small and probably will wear down easily, but we will have to see"
4.0,"I usually wear a small or medium but bought the large based on suggestions from other reviewers.  Glad I did.  I got the ""blue"" and absolutely love the colors.  Lots of black, blues and red which means I can wear it with most things in my closet.  I'd have preferred another inch in the length since it doesn't quite cover my butt.  I tried washing it and stretching it but that didn't help.  I definitely wouldn't put it in the dryer."
4.0,Wore this to an engagement party and got tons of compliments.
4.0,"It's good, but not like the original in quality. It works perfectly fine though. Not 5 stars because its quality is less than original."
4.0,This dress has some interesting design choices but I do like the style and the white ribbon accents make it stand out even more. I would have liked it better if the lining went the length of the dress instead of only reaching mid thigh. The fabric feels nice and cool but is surprisingly heavy.
4.0,"Pretty cool mask for the price! The lights are bright and 8t comes with a sort of head wrap that you can adjust with velcro. Fits me perfectly but if you have a bigger neck and head, I wouldn't recommend the purchase.<br />Downside me fir is that there is no switch to toggle between sliced light and being activated by sound. If that's what the scrolly weel was for, I guess mine didn't operate as it should.<br />I love it either way, it's a lot of fun and even with the light off, the design is vivid.<br /><br />Thing to keep in mind since we're having to wear masks now. This is NOT a medical mask. You will need to have a fabric or surgical grade mask under the fabric of this one because there is a hole for your nose. Be safe!"
4.0,Good quality & good fit!
4.0,"Love the design! The only reason I’ve given four stars is because I haven’t been able to tell a difference due to the anti-inflammatory properties they claim it has. However, I’ve only had it for about a week. If I notice any changes I’ll update!"
4.0,"I really loved this shirt. But, I had to return it. Others here posted that these shirts ran small so to order 1 size up. I followed that advice, to my detriment. I normally wear a Large, ordered an XL, and it swam on me. I could tell that the material was nice; it did feel great for the whole 45 seconds I wore it, and if I could re-order it in Large I would in a heartbeat but only XL and XXL are available. I hope the Seller brings this back in a Large!"
4.0,Fair quality for price and shipped quickly.
4.0,The needle for the buckle keeps detaching so I’m careful how much pressure I use to push in the holes and the belt is already peeling but otherwise the belt is very sturdy
4.0,Super cute. Really big though.
4.0,"Loved the fabric, sized a bit small. Would go up a size."
4.0,"I'm 5'4&#34;, 149lbs - bought the L and it fits just right... that is, outside of the butt area, there isn't really any extra room. The length is right just below my ankles - I'd recommend size larger for anyone over 5'4&#34;. The fabric is really great but it bled when I washed it on delicate/cold so now the white parts have a bit of blue/grey tint to them. Not a big deal, but it happened. Wash separately, like I did. The fuzzy material is on the medium/thinner side, but should be thick enough with just undergarments for 50F weather.<br /><br />UPDATE: The zipper on this item is very flimsy - it broke (was not properly sewn at the end) and I cannot put it back on. I am returning, since exchange is not an option."
4.0,Seems too big even after adjusting. But i like it for its simplicity.
4.0,Overall I am satisfied with this product but it does seem like the chain is about to break every time I am going to wear it even though it was for a cheap price. It is very pretty and shipping is fast! :)
4.0,"Bought these for my son for Christmas and he LOVES them!  They aren't the thickest, but the description said they were casual/dress socks, so I'll excuse the thinness."
4.0,Purchased this hat for my 3 year old grand daughter.  Fits well and the pony tail slot works out perfectly. Very pleased with the product.
4.0,Nice wallet for the price.<br />Plenty of room for cars.
4.0,I ordered a larger size do to previous reviews and it is perfect.  Received  the item in a timely manner as well.
4.0,maybe I have a big head? lol
4.0,"Love the quality and thickness of this shirt, its a mix between long sleeve and hoodie - not too thick! The color is a bit brighter yellow than expected i was hoping for more of a gold, but overall i love it and will be a great fall shirt!"
4.0,I ordered this belt to wear to the Rodeo. It fit comfortably and looked really nice. Good quality belt.
4.0,love them but they didn't last too long
4.0,The bar is a little long for my belly button but besides that it is cute and it glows in the dark!
4.0,A little tighter than expected you may want to go 2 sizes up other than that they're good
4.0,"I really love the beanie, but I will say it fit a little snugger than I thought it would. It does keep me warm and it's very comfortable though! I would say it's a good buy, but just know that the product will fit a little snug."
4.0,Very cute shoes love them
4.0,Looks good and seem strong
4.0,We're too thick. Pants didn't pull over. Should have gotten nylon.
4.0,"These lanyards are much nicer than the picture, and they are the perfect length for my 10 year old. The only downside is that the clasps are a little small for some masks and it can be very uncomfortable against your cheek."
4.0,nice purchase!
4.0,Purchased as a Christmas gift.
4.0,"Belt is great, have some problems getting it undone at time"
4.0,"The Mrs. says it's a little small. Otherwise, she loves it."
4.0,"Liked grey color, band is adjustable and comfortable.<br />Did not like that where band attaches to tracker is plastic because it makes it look cheap."
4.0,"This is a beautiful bag.  Soft, comfortable to carry.  Well made, zippers are good quality metal, stitching is nice, attractive and looks like it will hold up indefinitely.  The lining is nice and pretty. It's a perfect size - roomy enough for everything I like to carry but small enough to be carried as a clutch.  I believe this is is a combination of leather and a man made leather material. It is beautiful in any case.<br />The only complaint I have is the shoulder strap.  The wrist strap is very nice but the shoulder strap isn't put together well.  There's a line of  a white sticky substance that runs the entire length of the strap.  It looks cheap and I don't believe it's leather.  It has fibers pulling loose and it's a paper thin material.<br />I would like a replacement for this strap as I do want to use it.  If that's not acceptable then I will be sending it back.<br />I also bought an identical black bag and it's shoulder strap looks good, it does not have any problems."
4.0,Very pretty but tok a long time to receive.  Shipped from international vendor.
4.0,"Everybody has different sizes and even looking at the size chart, I still got a size too small. I love this costume and it is made well, besides the gems of the belt falling off the string because of the glue being weak. I grabbed medium, and I am definitely not large and I fit on the costume size chart, but unfortunately it still was very very small."
4.0,I love this romper.  I can't wait for the weather to warm up so I can wear it out.  It does run small I had to return the small and get a medium ( I am 5'6 and 100lbs)) but besides that I love it.
4.0,Beautiful!As described! Fabric a little lighter than I had hoped but still beautiful and vibrant!!🤗😘
4.0,"Beautiful mask, well made, detailed and gorgeous with its glitter detailing.  Note that there is only a ribbon to tie the mask on your face (no elastic), and it is made for a smaller face.  It fit my 13 year old daughter perfectly.  She mentioned it is a bit heavy on her face, but for a mardi gras themed dance, and wearing it only a few hours at a time, it worked well."
4.0,"These were perfect (along with a few other similar items) for a 2-week trip to Europe. Made it easier to pack, separate/categorize, manage during the trip and unpack at home. Just resist the temptation to stuff them too much . . . or you'll end up over-packed and risk wrinkling your clothes."
4.0,thinner. attractive.
4.0,"Beautiful dress, they said it runs small so I ordered a 6, I should have ordered a 4.  Came quickly and I am happy. :)"
4.0,I like it.It is very pretty and looks great on my bracelet.
4.0,"This shirt fits as I expected. I am 5'1&#34;, ~110lbs, small chested, muscular but petite. The &#34;one size&#34; fit me perfectly--fitted but not too tight, shoulder seams hit in the correct place, not too short in the torso or sleeve length. I really doubt it would fit anyone much larger, as an FYI.<br /><br />I was concerned that the swirly things look see-through in the picture. They are not. The whole shirt is opaque."
4.0,"Product looks just like the picture. Backs are a touch flimsy, but to be honest I expected that with this price."
4.0,"Hypoallergenic, easy to use, easy to clean, cute colors. It's worth the money."
4.0,"I love this dress! I Came back for the red one after buying the navy.<br />I'm 5' 8&#34; and t is long enough on me.. the front kind of dips up, but i actually am wearing it backwards. I like it best that way..<br />I think it's meant for someone a little less buxom (36DD here)..but if i turn it around it totally takes the weird pucker away from under my arms. I would recommend for the price. Fabric is thick and not at all cheap looking to me."
4.0,Got these to spicy things up in the room and they sure work. But are hard to get off sometimes.
4.0,"I saw the reviews that this shirt runs small, and they're right. I ordered a Large, which fits great (Bust: 34, Waist 28 ¼, Hips 35 ½). I only wish the drawing of Tink was a little smaller and positioned higher on the shirt--her lower face bunches up at my waist and across my hips. But, I'm just using as a pj shirt, so no big deal. Love how soft it is and the vibrant color."
4.0,"This sweater arrived yesterday and I'm wearing it to work currently. This sweater is really soft and comfortable. I like the style because the sleeves and shoulders make it just fancy enough to count as work attire. Unfortunately, this is not a true black sweater, but is actually a dark gray. Had to take off a star for that because I didnt get what I was expecting. Overall I'm very pleased with this product and I'll be ordering the other color today. I ordered a size large, to be on the safe side, but I would definitely be able to size down to a medium. For reference, I am 5'3"" and 145 lbs."
4.0,Super super SOFT! Nice thick padding. Kids are really happy with them!
4.0,I wear a size small and since these stretch I thought they would fit nicely however they are snug and I wish I would have gotten a medium. They are soft though :)
4.0,Super cute...Brought it for a TeaParty. Can't wait to wear it!!!
4.0,Nice sock for the price.
4.0,"Love this item it is very adjustable and comfortable, great quality, . I wore the first time and I have gotten so many compliments about it.I know its a man's watch but I love large face watches. My significant other loved it. It comes with the tools to take links out if too big. Wore it And it was notice  right away with compliments .Delivery was fast and will buy again, and recommend"
4.0,"Haven't worn but I tried it on and it's just like the photos. A little baggy around arm holes so you're the side of your bra will show, FYI"
4.0,"Very sold inside, rubber sole provides the amount of support slippers should have. Run a little larger than I was expecting but they are still a really nice slipper. The pink color is really cute! Also the tongue is a little big and sometimes folds in or out but it’s not that big of a deal for the amazing price"
4.0,"These took a while to ship - but I have them as prizes in my classroom and the kids loved them! 1 out of 10 that I ordered did not work at all right out of the box, but the other 9 were good."
4.0,Should have check measurements bc they were a little to small for my vape but it all worked out!
4.0,Great fabric and good fit. The thinness is perfect if you do not want something overly thick
4.0,It was a great gift for who I needed it for. The charm was about the size as I expected. I thought the note of inspiration would be a little bigger but it was fine.
4.0,"Love the bathing suit top! It fits well and definitely provides a little lift.  The bottoms fit a little on the smaller side...which is unusual because my upper body is larger than my lower half.  Overall, if you pick a size larger than you are, you’ll be very satisfied with this product!"
4.0,Nice light material. Pretty style
4.0,Queda bien al frente pero toda la parte de atrás hasta el cierre la tela es muy fina y se dobla con facilidad lo que resulta incómodo.  Si no le daría un 5.
4.0,Great for my 16 hrs standing and all day full of energy
4.0,Its a tight fit but not unexpected.
4.0,Was pleased with the dress for the price. It is very see through so be aware of that. It is also made very small so be sure to order a size up from what you normally wear.
4.0,"I order a small and the dress was very cute, is just that the dress is kind of short, but of you dont matter about that like me, you will like the dress."
4.0,the necklace glows with 3 batteries in the lace itself and is great<br />easy to turn it off and on<br />4 stars because the lace is a clear plastic band but still worth it<br />highly recommended especially as a gift
4.0,Cute little dress but does run on the smaller side. It is better with tights as it is much shorter than seemed. Barely bend at all on your buns are in the breeze.
4.0,"Great colors, fit and quality. Perfect for a donut themed party."
4.0,"I got this case at a discount so I thought I'd try it out. Overall, it is a good case, very protective and looks nice."
4.0,The straps adjust which is great for those of us who are shorter. I have worn this a few times and received compliments every time. Cute on its own or layered under a cardigan or denim jacket.
4.0,"These shorts are great to just throw on and go. The fabric is lightweight and has no stretch. It's similar to canvas. There are two pockets in the front and two in the back. The hem hits just above mid thigh (I'm 5'6""). I found the fit to run small. If you're curvy, you may want to size up.<br /><br />Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review. I hope the information that I've provided makes your decision a little easier."
4.0,"Super cute dress, seems to run a little large.  It is versatile to buy some sweaters to change the look to a skirt and be a little warmer and extend the wearability to multiple events.<br />  The v.neck is deep."
4.0,Dedinetely a must have to any wardrobe.  Stitching is good size is as expected. Only reason not a 5 is that it had a very foul smell when I opened it.  It's been opened for a few weeks and it still smells.
4.0,"Zipper does not work,but I was able to pull it on,wish the fit 2as a little tighter.  I'm 5'3 and 130lbs."
4.0,my boobs are too big for the top lol
4.0,"Very comfortable, they slide down a lot but that may be because of the undies I was wearing."
4.0,Just a little small and the gem stone might be in different colors for the school colors. Otherwise I think my granddaughter will like it.
4.0,"Somewhat low quality, the bottoms fray EXTREMELY easily"
4.0,Good. Casual
4.0,"The colors don’t come as pictured but other than that great bras. Comfortable, flattening and sexy (or so my husband says). They looked like they would be way to small but they weren’t. I’m nursing twins also and they work well."
4.0,"Everything about this set is great. The products work very well, the only thing is the brush started to shed a little after the second cleaning. Overall great product for the price."
4.0,I liked the swimsuit. Problem was the fabric for the top was really very heavy and the bra cup pads were oddly placed for me.  Maybe I should have ordered one size smaller.  Bottoms fit perfect!
4.0,"A little early to be writing a review since we just got it. Seems decent quality and fits my husband well oh, but the zipper is on the side for a woman and he's having a hard time getting used to it. Description did not show a picture of the battery, I expected a different one like my brother-in-law had, with USB. It's about the size of a cell phone."
4.0,"I do not own a car and walk almost everywhere. It RAINS in Washington and I needed a lightweight, rain proof jacket. This is close to perfect...one thing to make this 5 stars would be if it were lined. I read others reviews that it ran a little large. I have wide hips so I ordered 1 size larger than I would normally. Its a tight zip at hips but then fits a tiny bit big rest of the way up. Hood is perfect. I like the reflective strip. The wrist have a strip of Velcro but no way to tighten them. Pretty good for price!"
4.0,Very cute and soft; love the material.  For my grandson's 1st birthday; I'm sure his mom will love it!
4.0,"Really cute, but size up because the material is thin and somewhat see through."
4.0,Nice look but don’t fit my large head
4.0,Super cute top. Perfect for work. Sits a little shorter than expected but great with jeans or high waisted pants.  Love the color
4.0,The souls are cheaply made. my foot slides to one side. But does the trick I like them a lot!
4.0,I ordered a large- fits just right.  I would recommend ordering a size up from what you’d normally get.
4.0,"It's a little snug around the top and I wish it was longer, but I'm tall. Overall, exactly what I was looking for, very cute."
4.0,"Really nice opera gloves. They have some stretch, so fit really well, comfortable gloves. They are not the typical shiny satin opera gloves. They have a sheen, but are more muted. They look more expensive then the shiny kind, in my opinion."
4.0,"The dress was large in the waist and the slit is VERY high (don't sit down). Once I had it tailored and the slit closed, it was a beautiful dress!"
4.0,"This dress is gorgeous which is why it gets 4 stars. Minus one star bc the overlay is really delicate and I’ll be shocked if it lasts a week without ripping. Once it’s shreds and I have to cut it off the dress will still be pretty.<br />Bodice is narrow, beware solid girlies. Has a zipper though.<br />Train is nearly 5 feet long.<br />I’m keeping bc it’s too cumbersome for me to return orders. Had I saw this in store I would have passed bc it’s not going to hold up to more than a handful of wears. I won’t be throwing it in the wash machine."
4.0,"I was thrilled to find long sleeve raglan with arm stripes.  And in dark and slate blue would have been perfect.  I still like the color, but the example photo makes it look like the lighter blue is slate but in reality, it is just light blue.  My photo represents the color pretty closely."
4.0,"This top is very cute and stylish. I'm 145lbs, ordered a medium and it fits me perfectly. However the fabric is very thin in my opinion."
4.0,This necklace's so nice. The Crystal is clear.<br />I bought different colors & gave to my friends. They all love it.
4.0,We bought  these to pass candy out in and they were great but there’s no spot to put your nose! The mask just presses up on the nose which hurts so it’s just not suitable for continuous wear.
4.0,Super comfy tanks‼️
4.0,Turned my finger green but knew it would
4.0,The quality of the fabric is great. Since it is elastic it fit pretty good but the dress is very long. Other than that it is a great dress
4.0,"They are comfortable overall, but they don’t help shape you and they lose their shape after you wear them for a while. I would still buy them again, but in a smaller size."
4.0,"Durable. Accurate. Daily alarm.  Timer. Backlight is dim, but legible.  Great value for price. The original strap was comfortable and could be sized to fit children and adults. I ended up buying a few of these watches before I finally got to keep one.  The kids kept taking them from me."
4.0,I love it! It fits comfortably and looks so real!
4.0,"Overall satisfied with these! They're a fun bright yellow color, fit great and are comfortable. Only taking away a star because the butt is transparent so will need to wear a long shirt to cover so as to not let undies show."
4.0,"I love that the dress didn't look cheap although very inexpensive. I am 5'7, 145lbs and it fit perfectly. Fell just below the knee not to short, or long. The downside was the pocket was not sewn completely which left hole. I will definitely be ordering from the Grace Karin line again."
4.0,"Nice dress. wish the material was a little thicker, but love this stripe dress."
4.0,"Looks good anywhere. The only thing is setting it up. The instructions are good, but the stem unscrews too easily when getting the proper day and date."
4.0,I love these beads and they are just the right weight and look. The gold did tarnish near the closure almost immediately upon the first few times wearing but I still would recommend them!
4.0,"Fabric and color is good, ran small.  Keeping for motivation... Will and did purchase others."
4.0,It was a beautiful bracelet. I got it as a gift for my mom for Christmas. She loved it and wears it everyday. The picture is exactly how the bracelet is. The only thing i didn't like which is why I'm giving it a 4 is that it isn't a sterling silver bracelet. I believe it was alloy metal maybe. But it wasn't too big a deal because no-one can tell the difference. Completely beautiful though.
4.0,"Very nice jacket. Only problem - I ordered gray, but I received a blue jacket. Unfortunately this is not the color we wanted. However, as far as the jacket itself goes, the thickness is nice and the jacket feels soft and comfortable. It is not traditional fleece. It has a thicker weave of some kind. Overall, it is a lovely jacket, just not the color we ordered."
4.0,It's a bit snug for an XL. The tights and belt were definitely too small for me. So I used a belt and leggings I already had. I'm 5ft 7in and I weigh about 200ibs. Over all my boyfriend says it looks hot lol. His words not mine. 😂
4.0,fits great and very comfortable  and managable fabric
4.0,"These fold up nicely at first, but after a few uses the creases disappear, which makes it hard to fold them up again. They take up more space than I expected, but they’re sturdy, brightly colored, and easy to carry. They also hold quite a bit. Definitely worth buying."
4.0,These are so adorable....great value
4.0,Love it. Comfortable and flexible<br />Also shapes the body and enaces curves
4.0,Super comfy and sexy casual too
4.0,"It’s a nice TUNIC dress, so it’s loose, the fabric is thin but it’s not see-through. Love the vintage tablecloth look of it. Not for everybody, specially if you haves big arms. Believe or not, got a lot of compliments on it. Great for the price."
4.0,"This is such a cute shirt! I don’t know how other colors fit, but the rainbow tie dye is a little snug. I sized up to an XL for a looser fit and it’s still not loose. It’s wearable so I’ll keep it, but it definitely does not fit like the picture. I normally wear a medium or large, for reference."
4.0,My girlfriend work these for a wedding and said they were extremely comfortable and the rice was right
4.0,The work great.  They fit snug and stay together well in between layers.  They have been keeping my hands warm working in cold weather.
4.0,"My wife really likes these. But as she is long and lean, they are short for her. Also, as they are white, they are a little &#34;sheer&#34;."
4.0,Was actually surprised at the quality of the jacket given its low  price point.  Solid construction and a good fit.
4.0,"pretty good, really good for the price. I like the tint on the driving glasses."
4.0,The fit was fine the length was a little larger than expected
4.0,"A very comfortable light weight pant.Good quality for the low price and washs well. The elastic waist band gets a little twisted sometimes, buts it is not a big deal to straighten out. I ordered the black and would consider buying another pair."
4.0,"The pattern is exactly has pictured, thin fabric, very sheer. It have a large bust (34dd) and this did not fit over my chest. Had to return, too bad."
4.0,"Very thin material, more t-shirt than a sweater knit. Layers well, lovely color. Can't get the collar to lay the way it does on the model, but I'm totally willing to blame myself and my body for that one. Excellent separate for jazzing up casual, business casual, or adding a touch of class to something, but equally lovely as a business or dressy accessory.<br />Adds just a bit of weight, not much, and the tight-fitting sleeves keep it out of the way.<br />Lovely hip-length drape, which works well for me (I'm tall, 5'11&quot;). Finding shirts or sweaters that reach long enough but don't tent out is a challenge and this provides an excellent add-on for bridging those that are just a tad too short without having to wear pants up to my ribs.<br /><br />Not exactly what I expected, but I am just delightfully surprised and pleased with what it is. Quickly my go-to piece, and I plan to get another in the exact same color to stash back (pets...they enrich our lives, plus, just in case it snags), I have my eye on two other colors, and I plan to get it for my mother and sister.<br /><br />It's not going to add much in warmth, but the sleeves slide under coats well and the fabric doesn't wrinkle, so if you're after a little light something, this may be your answer."
4.0,"Travelon is my favorite brand. Lightweight, strong with built in RFID protection. This is smaller than my others, which I wanted. It fits my HDX Kindle. I would prefer more than three credit card slots, but I can cope."
4.0,Wanted rfid feature
4.0,Wish they made bigger sizes of this type of slip on for handicapped  kids
4.0,It is a real shaper vest which doesn't allow you to eat very much....
4.0,"This is a good product for the most part.  I have very sensitive skin that's why I bought this nose ring because it calms to be 18k white gold, but it still irritates my nose.  If you don't have skin problems u definitely should pick this up. It may just be because it is a hoop, but I'm not entirely sure.  It made my nose slightly sore and red.  But it looks great.  I pinched it tighter so it would hug my nose more and I love the look.  I'm gonna leave it in for a few more days to see if it's just irritated from changing it."
4.0,The quality is so-so but it's a very pretty dress!
4.0,I loved these pants. I am petite so I have to get them hemmed.
4.0,Hat is well made and a better fit than the cheap quality hats issued to Wal Mart employees
4.0,nice and wide like it.
4.0,My kid is a huge fan of “Stranger Things” and the ‘80s baby in me loves that! She adored this buy and gets so many compliments on it at school. It goes well with her “In a world full of tens be an eleven” hoodie.
4.0,"It serves its purpose , quite comfortable . And cheap , other companies sell it for double or triple the price . The only con is the colors fade after so many washes, better just hand wash it"
4.0,"For this review, it looks like the picture was corrected and showing the right color. The color when ordering looks a little more maroon. I was a bit disappointed in the color - it is actually very red, but it did fit and I decided to keep it."
4.0,"This tank top is cute. It's very lightweight but thick enough fabric to not feel cheap. The stitching on the bottom hem had a little hiccup, but not noticeable unless you really look for it. I normally wear a large top and have a 36DD chest and the size L fit perfectly. I wore this with a stick on strapless bra - [[ASIN:B01ANW2W8W Liswic Women's Reusable Strapless Self Adhesive Silicone Invisible Everyday Bra]] and it was perfect! I was comfortable running errands with my daughter and my husband agreed it looked great.<br /><br />I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for my open and honest review."
4.0,"Just got it today.  Can't wait to try it out with my nightly prayers and mantras.  The malas are beautiful. The string seems flimsy so I am hoping it will hold up, though I've given it a few test tugs and it seems okay.  I wouldn't recommend being rough with it though."
4.0,Delivered on time.  We love it!  Thanks!
4.0,"I compliment this dress  for its style, I really like it. The flower on the chest, sleeves and the bottom part of the dress and how its beautifully laid out makes the dress look very elegant yet simple that you can wear it anytime. You can wear it with flat shoes/sandal to go to the mall, or even grocery shopping or wear it with heels for for an evening occasion and it will definitely fit it. However, my big wish is the length of the dress, size wise perfectly fit on every part (Im a 5'0 90 lbs  asian petite woman). Im always a small in size, its like in everything but this dress is way too short for me.  I wish it was a little longer coz I love this dress but I cant wear it  without having something for the bottom coz if its worn as a dress it will show your ass, not very ladylike as the dress would have been supposed to be."
4.0,"I love the style of this suit but it runs super small so I had to return it.  I normally wear a size 8-US  and ordered a medium- it was about a size 4-US.  Again, cute and well made but beware its supper smaller than advertised!"
4.0,"It’s a cute purse, fits a decent amount of stuff, but it came with some superficial scuffs or dents on the front surface. Only noticeable if you’re really looking."
4.0,"I am 5’4” and weigh 165.  I ordered XL, concerned that the regular large would be too snug around the hips.  I’m really glad I went with the XL!!!  The top fits perfectly (I’m a 38B), the pants are a bit loose (the way I like them) and the robe is more like a medium because it really doesn’t wrap around much, but it still fits otherwise.<br /><br />I’d like to comment on the sizes.  I’ve seen two different reviews by people my same height, but weighing over 200 pounds who ordered mediums and then complained that they were too small.  Of course they were too small.  You should have ordered the EXTRA LARGE, and even then it may not have fit.  The measurements were given for the sizes.  Anyway ...<br /><br />I love how soft these are and the fabric is just thick enough to provide some modesty without being too thick or hot.  The colors are nice and complement me well.  They are perfect for the warm weather location where I live now and also lovely when I move to my new home in a much colder region.  They will look fabulous with my cute pink moccasins!  I have another set in my shopping cart, but I wanted to see how I liked this set first.  I’m going to go order the other set now!  That’s glowing praise from me, indeed."
4.0,The top ball comes loose on its own occasionally and I don't realize it until it's on the floor. They are really pretty and a great value.
4.0,I have a hard time ordering swim suits on line . I ready the reviews went up to a XXL was to big but still able to wear it. Love the color and style.
4.0,"I bought these to visit an elderly person and being able to see my mouth did help. They will fog up some, although they still serve the purpose. I’m glad I have these and got some compliments on them, as well!"
4.0,I really like this collar! I just wish it were a little smaller. The collar doesn't sit flat on my neck as it's too big. I'll have to pin it down for it to look better.
4.0,These shoes fit somewhat small for a size 8.
4.0,"Nice design, nice print. Good quality fabric. Only washed once, so I don't know how the print colours stand up over time.  Would have preferred a slightly wider neck, but I could see from the picure that it's quite narrow, so it's not a fault of the product as such, just my preference,"
4.0,"This is a great top. The fabric is lovely the quality is good the price is fair. Only problem I see is that it is a little bit too short for my liking, but that is perhaps just because I’m a bit older"
4.0,So i got this for my husband and son for his first birthday  (my daughter and I were with ladies). It faded a bit in the first wash but the shirt quality was nice so your really couldn't tell too much. My only complaint is that the writing was a bit too small.
4.0,great protection but really dark cant see anything if its not really sunny. as soon as you have a cloud or shadow you have to take them of to drive.
4.0,"This shirt is very pretty and the fabric is great, but I ordered a medium and the shirt fit like a large."
4.0,"First of all:<br />Sizing/Fit- i went with the suggestions to go a size big but DONT!  I'm 5'11&#34; 155lbs. I wear 31w 32i pants and ordered a 34... mistake.  I ended up returning and reordering a 32... they're a good fit. Inseam is long but adjustable. Pants are a bit baggier than most reviews suggested, but still way better than most military supply $20 camp pants.  The knee pads are good and the Velcro adjustments are cool.<br /><br />Quality- they seem like just  step below 5.11 quality but I'll accept it. I like them I wish they were about $20 cheaper then I'd really love them. The stitching seems like it's gonna hold up and they aren't too bad to move in either.<br /><br />Color- CP was a cool color,  decent style multicam but I had to return them because of the size 34 debacle... they didn't have any in 32 so I went with the army green.... I was hoping it would be more like a ranger green (green/grey) but they're green.<br />I heard that the black typhoon was pretty cool looking too.<br /><br />Overall-  yeah I'd suggest trying them out, like I said, $60 would've been an awesome price for these hence the 4 star rating. But they're cool. I like them."
4.0,Like them a little stylish but wish they were customs for fatter earlobes but I manage with the size that I have they do fall off from time to time but for the price they ight 🤷🏽‍♀️
4.0,Like boot cut
4.0,"My son loves these shoes. They look big to me, but actually do fit."
4.0,"I ordered this in the peacock blue. The color is exactly what I expected. I love the fit of the skirt. It is flowy and comfortable. The issue I have is that it is very long. I am 5' 5"", which is close to average. However this skirt is so long I have to pull it up to my bra line to keep it from touching the ground. I'm going to see if my sewing skills will get me through hemming this without it looking too bad."
4.0,like the belt will buy again
4.0,Got for husband. He wears them all the time now. Loves the color and look that he is going for.
4.0,"Runs just a little small if you want to button all the way, which I don’t. Good quality and really cute."
4.0,Cute house shoe but does run small
4.0,Nice party dress. Fun to wear.
4.0,"Fits as expected - nice, comfy dress. Well made."
4.0,Good for jewelry and sterling ware.
4.0,Great original classic Casio but poor night time  use. I reordered the illuminator version of same watch much happier.
4.0,Beautiful dress but top of dress color does not completely match the bottom tulle. I was using it for my daughter's birthday and wanted her to be Sisu.
4.0,"For religious girls who wear leggings under your skirt this is a good purchase. At $12 a skirt, they're perfect for exercise. They're totally see through so I wouldn't wear these with nothing under and they cling to your legs so if you care about that, wear it only to the gym or not around men.  You can easily move them, they're light and even the pink is not such an out-there color. I'm happy with them for what I needed."
4.0,"I'm not sure who the company is trying to market  this watch to.  The watch and band are as large as a man's  watch but the lights are something that kids would really like.  The watch and band would dwarf a small child's wrist.  Having said that, the lights are really fun and the face is attractive.  For the price, it is a fun watch."
4.0,I really like the bracelets. Looks great on my wrist and also complainants my watches
4.0,"Cute bows, good fit and lots of colors. There's not a thing wrong with the purchase. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that they're not quite my preferred style. Still, great purchase for the price."
4.0,"I want to say that I have ordered 4 of these dresses now in different colors, same size.  Each is different.  I returned the pink tie dye one because it was bigger then I wanted and I also ordered the cotton candy looking tie dye dress which fit better.  I wanted it for a pool/beach dress.  The material is like tshirt material.  I am worried that it will shrink when I wash it and maybe I should have kept the larger one instead but I don’t know yet.<br />I also ordered black and that one took a longer time to arrive so they seem to come from different locations.  The black was also on the bigger side but the same tshirt material.  I am hoping it will fit perfect after washing.<br />What was most surprising to me though was the navy blue/ leaf pattern dress I ordered was a different material.  It is like swimsuit material.  I am keeping all 3 of the dresses I uploaded photos for and I am sorry I didn’t take photos of the one I returned which was the largest. You can see in my photo how the dresses I kept vary slightly in size too.<br />Overall I like them as pool/beach cover ups but they are a bit overpriced in my opinion"
4.0,"A unique spin in the military style of cap. Seems well made and my first few days of wearing it has been a comfortable wear. First impressions were ""It feels big in my head"". I am a size 7- 3/4 which is about 22.5 inches. I washed and dried it with hopes it would shrink and it seems it did. But after wearing it all day it went back to feeling too loose specially on the top. ""One size fits all"" or ""one size fits most"" should be followed by ""you better have a head larger than 22.5 inches in diameter. No regrets. I will put it to good use. I will just be ready to chase after it on any breeze or windy day."
4.0,These are nice came really quickly only problem was one of the kept unsnapping in my ear but it's okay since I got 2 sets of them really nice earrings for the price and people who keep saying they are big read the description they tell you the exact measurements of them
4.0,This is meant to be snug fitting so order bigger if you want loose but it’s meant to be tight fitting. Washes well!
4.0,Pretty cute dress great for the price wish it had a slit it's kind of hard to walk in. I ordered a size small and it fit well.
4.0,"This product looks great!  It feels and looks like much more expensive models.  The only downsize and why I gave it 4 stars is that it is super sharp for plastic.  Two boys were injured bleeding and crying after playing but that being said, great looking product, super sharp tips - ,maybe like it should be?"
4.0,It's pretty.....  Pretty thin! It's nice but I was hoping for a bigger effect. Oh well!
4.0,I am 5’6” and 165 lbs. I ordered the large. There is good stretch but I would order your true size.  I like my sleeves a little longer for long sleeve shirts and these come right to my wrist so they are not long. They shirt is good quality. I bout 2 or 3 colors and I am pleased.
4.0,"I wasn't disappointed, they're cute especially for the price"
4.0,These shirts are very cute and they arrived fast. The only thing to consider is that they are quite short. They show a lot of belly.
4.0,"I ordered a medium and it’s a little smaller than what I’d expect. But it has an elastic waistband, so it’s a little forgiving. Overall, I’m happy with the skirt. It’s true that the buttons are only for decor; they do not function, but I think it’s nice to not have to worry about a button coming undone!"
4.0,It was exactly what my daughter was looking for
4.0,Nice outfit but you will need to wash by hand or the white will look dingy
4.0,Strap across foot rubs it raw . Love the sole as I have neuropathy and wore these many yrs ago. Strap is cheaply made and should be a non sweat fabric..such as leather or cloth..
4.0,Love the look but the chain tangled easily
4.0,Love these.  Ordered a second pair in black after wearing these a few months.
4.0,"I like it. It came in a tint ziplock and it was all tangled. Took forever to untangle it. But it looks fine, not as long as I thought it would be though. And I ordered it not realizing it had lame crosses on it. Still cute though."
4.0,TOP IS GREAT
4.0,It was a little larger than expected but it’s a nice thick material. The print was pretty good as well. There was a slight mishap on a corner but it’s not too noticeable unless you are super nitpicky with items your wearing
4.0,Looks just like represented.  Nice sun moon stars charm.
4.0,I love these types of cardigans and I can wear them all year round.  Looks great with all my pants and skirts.  Plus it is interchangeable with everything.
4.0,"These shoes fit great and are very easy for my son to walk in (been walking for less than a month), just be sure to check out the sizing chart and measure. I've even run them through the washing machine a couple of times, and they are holding up well. My only complaint is that the color is rubbing off the toes (and slowly working its way to other parts of the shoe). I'm sure he will outgrow them rather quickly, but was hoping the quality would be better. Next time, I may just splurge and buy another set of Momo Baby ones for $2 more."
4.0,"Can't find these in 2X, which is a real shame.  They're the perfect light weight cotton for summer wear.  So far no shrinkage in 3 or 4 washes, holding up well.  If I could get them a little larger I'd buy a dozen!"
4.0,Have bought many of these dresses and they are way too big in the bust for the model muse dolls. Even with another barbie doll they will still need to be taken in. Still a good buy. Would probably fit a vintage barbie better.
4.0,Fit true to size but it wasn’t very flattering Alittle to box shaped for me and I’m a curvy girl.
4.0,"I really like the shirt with the lace and the good quality. If your child is a 14 but not slender, this will be a little tight especially round her mid-section. My daughter wears a 12, the 14 was a little tight. Wearable, but snug around the belly."
4.0,"Very pretty! Easy to remove sections to make it smaller. Have worn it for 2 weeks, even to bed and hasn’t turned my skin green like others have stated. I haven’t gotten it wet though. My only grief was that it was missing a rhinestone when it arrived...but I had to remove a section to make it smaller anyways so no big deal."
4.0,Haven't truly tested them yet for riding but they definitely keep your hands warm in the cold.. No clue about water resistance.. No desire to get them wet. Only thing that made me pick 4 star instead of 5...the thumbs.. . So much padding at the end makes it hard to grab things
4.0,It’s easy to use.
4.0,"love  the  colors and  the  stretch,  I  just  bought it  too  big, I  ordered an  xl ,  I  should  have  down  sized  as  i  have  more  boobs  than  hips and  ordered  based on  my  hips , I  will  donate  to  a  friend  as  its  just  too  big  to  look  fabulous  on  me  its  still  beautiful"
4.0,"Sorry no pic, but I'm 5'6, 185 and got the XL. It's fits really nice and I got a ton of compliments at work! The navy blue is not see through and looks really professional. My only issue is the rouched part in front is a bit much and all the extra wrinkles and fabric form a ""smile"" shape right under my gut. So it kinda forces an appearance of a belly instead of hiding it. But it's still pretty. I washed in cold water and dried in normal dryer and no shrinking or color bleeding noticed."
4.0,"I wish the top print matched the red skirt a little more, seems like a stretch to pull red from the top. The waist line was not as tight as I would like it to be. But over all a beautiful dress!! I won't return it."
4.0,"I wear a small usually, ordered a medium after reading reviews. It fits well. The blue is a little different than the image shown. And the lace around the neck comes up your neck some. All and all very cute, and comfy."
4.0,I love<br /> it
4.0,"Bought it to wear for my anniversary, the waist of the dress I don't like"
4.0,"Very light and soft , but  should order one size bigger ."
4.0,It's beautiful. Great dress for a birthday or other events.
4.0,The light green and multicolor ones are beautiful like the photo. The turquoise is very dark not like the bright colorful photo. They are almost all dark brown. The multicolored circles are moderately heave being made of metal.
4.0,Fits was nice but belting was off and it's not white it's off white/cream color.
4.0,"I have two of these and they're great for my 4 and 6 year old boys. They can hear at safe levels during the loud band rehearsals, live sound events and during the races. They haven't complained about how they feel and fell asleep with them on. The DB reduction was a selling point for me as I wanted the most I could get for the price. The color options are great and so were the bags. Yes included is a bag for your cans! My youngest was able to concentrate in the store and my oldest loves to wear his while reading. I couldn't ask for more."
4.0,Arrived timely.  It smelled quite a bit but nothing a good washing didn't fix.  Mask had small cut outs for the eyes but I just cut them out more so my son could see better.  I noticed that others had done the same and some had even glued in the lens from sunglasses.  The mask glowed nicely and was the perfect mask for my sons alien costume.  This is a rubber mask so of course it can get quite hot if you have it on for a long period of time.
4.0,"These socks are just what I was looking for! They keep my feet warm and most importantly, they prevent me from slipping on my floors."
4.0,"Love this tank, got it as a gift for my sister in law.  Worth $25... probably not, but I really like the pictures on the back so I just went for it.  I read that is runs small in a lot of reviews, so I got her one size up.  I wouldn't say this runs REALLY small, so don't overdo the &#34;up-sizing&#34;.  Cute top!  4 stars only because it is overpriced."
4.0,Nice set but runs on the smaller size I bought for my 2 1/2 year old and have to return because too small He is average size
4.0,"These glasses are great for dimming glares from oncoming cars at night  They also help with daytime glare.  The only problem I have with them is that they don't fit over all glasses, especially rectangle or square ones.  Otherwise, great buy"
4.0,The dress fits really nice. My only complaint is that I am 5 foot. Had to hem dress 4 inches. Would love if it came in petite sizes.
4.0,"Very Pretty- a bit thin,  no slip needed true to size.  I am 145 and 5/7 I got a large"
4.0,warm n nice
4.0,"Bought for a friend's bday, nostalgic gift. Looks as pictured but very little stretch definitely size up for a looser more realistic fit"
4.0,"high waist, full length leg, medium weight nylon fabric. If  they came in white I would buy them for dying to match my other gear."
4.0,"A bit flimsy on the material.  No suport for the top, but otherwise it looks cute enough."
4.0,My mom loves them as they are perfect for work. She is very pleased with the product and thanks you for having such for those who need to work and can't quite find something nice enough as this is the head covering they need
4.0,"When I tried it on, it smelled like smoke. I recommend washing before wearing. Other than that issue, the design looks cool. It's easy to use. Not bad I guess."
4.0,"Fit me perfectly, I'm 6ft 175lbs. Looks great, everyone knew I was mercy (I had armor with it), only downside was the feet wore down in my heels after only a few hours of wear so I'll probably have holes in the feet after my next wear..."
4.0,Good socks but wish they were just a bit longer and had a heel
4.0,"This cardigan was just as described - great color and fit. Very versatile. Ended up purchasing it as a gift for the holidays and returning it, as my friend didn't care for the buttons on the sleeve - but I still think it's a decent buy."
4.0,Purchased color in advertisement. Cheap spandex material not very flattering but I’m pregnant and it’s comfortable so whatever.
4.0,"This is a beautiful ring. The ring reflects light beautifully, and the opal color is vibrant. I also love that the ring is smooth so it will not catch on any fabric/thread. Great quality for the price."
4.0,"Good quality,good price"
4.0,"Shirt is very nice, but it was too large for my husband. For reference, he is 210lbs, 6ft 1.5in and usually wears a 42R dress shirt. We’re gonna order a medium for him to have the proper fit."
4.0,the material type i didn't like<br />colors were good<br />cheaply made<br />returned
4.0,Quick delivery. Beautiful product.
4.0,"My personal preference is for hats with more flexibility. Despite that preference, I think it's a great hat."
4.0,Liking my new yellow slides
4.0,Used during puppy play with a 5 month old German Shepard works great!
4.0,They look nice but are not holding up as well as when Genie bras first came out
4.0,Grandaughter said it was great - that is my input.
4.0,"The magnets on this strap are quite powerful and secure.  No worries about the watch dropping off.  I liked this but ultimately I went for an expansion band.  Having said this is a great, perfectly working alternative for the hundred-dollar band that Apple wants you to buy."
4.0,"I'm plus size and I have thick arms, but this jacket has arms that are WAY too big. It looks frumpy and it's a shame. It's such a cute jacket, super light weight and breathable but the arms by the biceps are way, way too big and they are way too long."
4.0,"Love the soft fabric and all the fun colors. Super comfortable, but they kinda ride up in the back a bit."
4.0,I wanted to try the fit and it does fit as described. I just didn't need the Asian fit for my face. So I plan on getting the regular holbrooks
4.0,"Bought as gift, seems very soft."
4.0,Loving this necklace. Sort of heavy but doing the job.
4.0,I love comfort and I could probably wear this as a dress with a belt. I am 5'1&#34; so I love it.
4.0,Was more please with this sandals than expected.
4.0,love the feeling of this dress.<br />I am 5'2 - 180lbs - large chest and butt - I ordered an XL and it fit great.<br />but does creep up a little while wearing
4.0,Light weight and soothing color. I bought the pink one which is great for summer. Flattering fit even with curves. Looking at other colors.
4.0,"Love the details on the top, just didn't quite fit me right."
4.0,I really like this sports bra but the reason I gave it four stars is because the straps on to of the shoulders are close to the neck in the back and kind of cut into the skin. It is not a painful thing but uncomfortable and if you wear it more than a few hours it does start to get a bit painful and I have to move them around a bit to relieve the pressure. I kept it though because usually I don't wear these more than a couple of hours.
4.0,Clean nibri& fit a size 8 brim
4.0,nice gave as a gift
4.0,"Fits great, medium to low impact. Vibrant colors"
4.0,"I bought these and a replacement pair of regular butterfly backs in case I did not like the silicone ones.  Good thing I needed a spare for another pair of earrings. These are quite fine for daily wear and I would hazard a guess that the old stand-by pair most of us over age 50 had when we got our ears pierced were just about this size. They are highly polished and well made. I put them on and have slept in perfect comfort.<br /><br />ETA:  alas, I lost one of the silicone backs within a week.  They simply do not grip the post securely.  Lucky I bought that replacement pair!  Note to the company:  retool the silicone backs or get rid of them."
4.0,"These are fine. Just got them, so I'll update the review as needed after wearing them a few times."
4.0,"I bought it and really liked it, however for me it fit too tight around the underarms and I had to return it. The colors were exactly as displayed and the fabric was really nice and overall design flattering.  I'd would have loved to keep it."
4.0,This is a cool one
4.0,These are nice earrings for the price; they look and feel good. The gold plate has worn away with 6 months of moderate wear. Be aware that because of the tapering design they can be tight if your pearcings are small.
4.0,love it easy to breath in
4.0,"My (now) step daughter is very petite and I bought her a size 4 which was a little big on her, but worked just fine. My ONLY complaint is that we had to use a lot of pins to try and get the sash to stay where the seam met, and it still wanted to ride up. It still worked perfect for what we needed and held up well since our flower girl stayed in it the entire wedding running around and playing! Practically no grass stains either. Very impressed with the over quality of the dress, especially for the price. The color we bought was spa with matched my bridesmaids spa dresses well from David's Bridal."
4.0,Bigger than I thought it would be.  Still very pretty.
4.0,I had a Skagen years ago and loved it was the reason I chose this one.  It is attractive on my wrist.  Love the easy flexibility of changing the width of the wristband; keeps excellent time.  Very affordable.  I'm looking forward to many years of enjoying this product.
4.0,"Love this top, very patriotic! Top is a little long to wear with shorts but would be great with longer shorts, leggings & jeans"
4.0,"The color is a little too vivid, but i like this item and wear it often because it is easy to wash and dry, needs no ironing and goes with jeans or skirts or dress pants. I bought another one in a dark teal color which is really beautiful. Well made. true to size, a nice addition to my wardrobe. Would buy again."
4.0,Bought this for my mother for her birthday. She loved it. Craftsmanship was as expected.
4.0,"Basic, fairly sturdy, and they work!"
4.0,"Purchased this for my mastectomy surgery. It’s very soft & comfy, the drains fit perfectly into the pockets & snaps were easy to open & close. The only thing I didn’t like was the weight of the drains pulling the shirt down, no fault of the shirt tho. I have to a friend going through the same thing & she absolutely loved it. It does run a little big, which is needed due to the drains."
4.0,I’m 5’3 103 lb and the XS was I little big for me… but these are still nice pants
4.0,"Took a while to get here, but at least the got here. I ordered an XL, following the sizing recommendations and received an XXL, but they still fit perfect. I received a blue pair, not a brown pair though (which is okay since I like blue better). I also received a pair of gray sweat-shorts with than that I never ordered, nor was charged for...<br />My only complaint was that the smelled really bad when I took them out of the package."
4.0,"Love this dress! The top part is a stretchy material, which is great! The skirt portion of the skirt is much larger than shown in the picture. If you're not a stick, it was be very unflattering to the behind!"
4.0,works great for holding my house/office keys<br />only down side is a lot of car key fobs are getting bigger and wont fit very well
4.0,I love the variety you get with these. Many shapes and sizes to choose from. My only issue I had is the closure strips after awhile and they will no longer clothes. For the price though they are an excellent buy. Would purchase again!
4.0,Liked it except for the loops to attached to camera.  The little loops are too thick to feed through the small attachment mounts on the sides of my Panasonic ZS100 camera.  Had to use camera's special loop adapters to which the rope-and-leather strap could attach.  Works but could be a cleaner appearance if the strap's loops were of smaller diameter material.
4.0,"I was very disappointed in the chain.  Other that that , I was very happy with it."
4.0,The shirt is great but after one wash is shrunk quite a bit on my Husband. It still fits just not as long as it was when I purchased it.
4.0,"LOVE this skirt. Im a size 4, 135lbs 5.7ft... ordered small had to return for a medium"
4.0,"They are super cute, just wish they were a little longer. The fabric seems a little too hot for photographing weddings, but still love these!!! So flattering and cute!!"
4.0,"Fits fine, could maybe even be a little tighter (I''m between size 2-4, 32C). It doesn't slip down, which is surprising considering there is no silicone to hold it up.The removable padding is a nice touch, which is one single piece that is shaped. As I'm not too blessed in that department it kind of gives more of a round/ i.e. obviously padded shape than I would like, and the padding kind of curls under at the bottom, so I have only worn it without the padding in. But I can imagine that larger chested ladies might find it more useful.<br /><br />Quality wise it is ok - It came with a small hole in one of the side seams. Since I'm not really using it for layering, no one will ever see so I'm not too bothered. But if I wanted the sides to be visible (i.e. under a drop armhole vest) it would be disappointing. But overall good value for money."
4.0,"Really neat &#34;wallet&#34;. Had to figure out the trick to getting cards in and out, but it's neat and functional."
4.0,"I love this sweater and will order another.  Very soft, bright color.  However, the color ordered was  plum purple; I received a bright fushia purple.  Kept it because I liked it nonetheless."
4.0,"These things are ugly, but I knew that when I ordered them.  The quality seems pretty high though.  They perform well enough, and since they're used at night, hopefully no one will recognize me."
4.0,Más delgada y flexible que la original pero totalmente compatible me gustaron.
4.0,Just like i wanted.
4.0,it was held together by globs of hot glue! disappointing... but it is still cute anyway... just not what i expected
4.0,could not find an exact replacement for my favorite Merrill sandals from years ago but these are an adequate replacement
4.0,"I was trying to find a good workout shirt that let my chest breathe and also didn’t feel baggy. Most of these reviews made me skeptical when I was ordering due to them telling you that you need to go down a size or does not fit right. I tried these anyways ordered a large, as I am in most shirts tall and medium size in chest and arms and I can say if you are a large and or any size stick to that because it will fit comfortably and look good. I will be ordering these again."
4.0,"Great quality, bigger than expected (size isn't really clear) so it does not match the other skulls that I have."
4.0,From the reviews I thought it might run large but I found it a little bit small. Really liked it though.
4.0,I bought these to wear as my nice casual shoes on a Mexican vacation. I have plantar fasciitis. I’m basically crippled if I wear regular shoes more than a couple of hours. These has enough support for my feet and are very light so great for packing. If they have other colors I might buy another pair.
4.0,The picture shows a pen. None in ours.
4.0,no issues.
4.0,Everyone has desert or green camo.  I have very cool digital blue.  Really cool blue digital camo.
4.0,Runs small through the arms.
4.0,Other than being to long they are great
4.0,They are very cute and very similar to the LL. I wish they had a few solid colors of the bundle.
4.0,Loved this top but stitching around bottom and the front where it crosses was really bad. It was also a little smaller than I thought
4.0,"I am 5'9"" 185lbs 36/38B with an athletic build.  I have wide shoulders so I typically have to get an XL in order for me to be able to move my arms in most tops, even thought the waist area is ultra big.  I have this in the 2xl (I wanted it to be extra baggy) and it fits more like a traditional XL over sized sweater on me!  Which is great.<br /><br />The tag is on the side of this sweater and the back is slightly longer then the front so you can tell which way the top goes on.  The material, is ultra soft but not as shiny or fluffy as the advertisement photos indicate.<br /><br />This will be great in the winter.  it is plenty large enough for me to layer over several items if desired."
4.0,"I LOVE this dress!  I am tall, so I expected it to be shorter than as pictured on the model.  But still glassy length.  I wore it to church with a crimson scarf, and received many compliments.  I think I will really enjoy this dress!"
4.0,The good news is the 3XL fit me perfectly. The bad news is I'm an American size 6/8. I wouldn't recommend this dress for anyone larger than an 8
4.0,"Day ghetto loved the backpack but was sad to see that they want you to screw in the handle, but that’s difficult when they don’t supply the screws."
4.0,Straps are a bit thin and it bothers on the long run and the hose tip gets messy overall its great.
4.0,love them and the feet for well however they don't zip all the way
4.0,I am impressed these leg warmers are very well made and warm and the price was great..The only problem is that the picture shows them going way up with it even slouchy.. I guess if your 10 lol..but over all these are nice :-)
4.0,This hat is perfect.  Dems hating on it.
4.0,"They are very good at blocking out the blue light. The only problem I have with them is that the anti-scratch rubber tips (that actually hold your glasses) keep falling off. And getting lost. Without the rubber tips, it's possible your glasses could get scratched by the metal posts. As a result, I have to keep buying a new pair every few months. I wonder if I can just buy/replace the rubber tips. Or if they could use some kind of glue to keep them from sliding off the posts."
4.0,"Runs a bit small, had to return a medium for a large. Inside pocket is placed a little high, cuff ribbing is starting to pill after one washing. Otherwise a very nice light jacket!"
4.0,Fits a little small but other than that good
4.0,"I really like the feel of these and the 2 pockets are a plus. If you have your phone in one pocket, you can put your ID or money in the other one without worrying about items falling out. The downside is that while they had an overall good fit, the elastic at the bottom isn't tapered to fit the thigh, so they flare out a bit. I'll use these around the house"
4.0,"Fit just right, love the custom text, I may order another one further down the road."
4.0,"I'm 5' 2&#34;, 132 pounds and a 36C. I bought the &#34;Free (S-L)&#34; size by just guessing as not many other reviewers specified their size and the size charts were not all that helpful to me. It seems to fit perfectly but if you are any smaller than me - by weight or wear a bra size smaller than 36C - I would think this would fall off of you. I can't say this for sure though so if you want to try it, there is always the option of the free return. I think if you are a little bit bigger than me this size would work for you but realize I have a bit of a time getting this on as I have to pull it up over my hips and it barely fits over them. I was worried I would rip the lace backing as I pulled it up but it seems pretty sturdy. I will see if it stretches out over time as I continually pull it over my hips. I personally have a hard time pulling it over my head so that option doesn't work for me.<br /><br />I bought this because I'm tired of wearing a bra when I get home. It makes me insane; I wear some pretty comfortable sports bras but even they start to bother me after awhile, especially the straps. At home, I'm often going out to my car, etc. and neighbors stop by so I don't want to be just hanging out there. I've been wearing this for a few days and it's working well and staying up. The first time I wore it, it made me a bit crazy because when you've been used to your bra having straps for 30 years it's sort of weird to not have straps. I kept pulling it up at first as I adapted to it; I think the illusion was it was falling down but it really wasn't. Now I'm used to it, don't think about it too much and only have to pull the back up every now and then.<br /><br />My boyfriend says this bra makes my chest hang lower and closer together which is to be expected without straps. I won't be wearing it out but it does the job at home, and he'll manage just fine. He doesn't have to tote these things around all day!<br /><br />I think the design and lace looks nice. There is some, what I consider minor padding, that does the job of keeping things smooth. There are little slits inside the cups by the padding that looks like you can remove the pads.<br /><br />I haven't seen the wear and tear on this thing just yet. If it doesn't last long I'll provide an update. For $11/$12 and free returns it's definitely worth a try!"
4.0,Great sunglasses.  very comfortable.
4.0,This dress didn't need ironing. The fit and flare style is flattering. The color is a little dull so I wear it with a colorful cardigan. Great value.
4.0,Realmente frescas en verano
4.0,Good money clip but my first one broke after three years of use.
4.0,"I tried these boots on locally and ordered them here. I like the boots. My feet get cold so I like the 1000 grams of thinsulate. The soles are plenty hard and a little slick in my tree stand but that is not a big deal. These are definitely cold weather boots, not for hiking as much as they are for sitting on stand. They seem well build like all Danner's so I think they will hold up. I would buy them again!"
4.0,I like the look and color.  The faux leather looks like true leather.  They are very comfortable without needing to wear them several times.  The strips at the top are a bit too loose.
4.0,"Wow I'm.m not sure how gold the chain is but it looks perfectly as shown in the picture,  I was very pleased with my purchase I was so scared at the club that some guys could jump me down because of how everyone was looking at me in the club.."
4.0,"This is such a cute bathing suit. But the torso is very short. I'm only 5'3&#34; and it is stretched as far as it will go. Other than that, the sizing is accurate."
4.0,Love it.  Just as expected
4.0,Pretty earrings. A little small for me
4.0,It is very warm and fits very well.  I loved wearing this to work.
4.0,After reading reviews decided to size up and it was too big.  I should have stuck with the medium.
4.0,i love this! It’s hard for me to find maxi dresses because I’m so short- but this fit great in length!
4.0,"This was my first set of zeta socks. The compression is very strong but unfortunately even though my calves were within range of the description with quite a few inches to spare, they were still tight at the top and left marks. I actually wear a calf tube type, then when the swelling is low enough, I switch to these.<br />If you don't have an absolute massive calf like I do though, they should be great --because they are STRONG! They don't stretch much at all and I about broke a sweat getting them on 😂 but the pain relief is so great. I had to go out and order different sizes and different compression levels!"
4.0,"Great quality for price, so cute!"
4.0,"This is well-made and is very sturdy. I sent it through the washing machine on perm press cycle. Everything stayed together but my hat bunched up inside. Maybe because it's a smaller hat with a curved bill, I'm not sure. The best thing is that the snaps really hold together and they shouldn't come undone in the washing machine. I don't think it will work for all hats/caps though which is why I deducted 1 star. I also don't think gentle cycle will make much of a difference in a front load machine."
4.0,"I love these hats.  My only complaint is the blue one fits perfect and has a nice slouch.  The red one is tight with no slouch.  I'm trying to stretch it and hope it works.  If not, I'll give it to my daughter.  Still, very nice quality"
4.0,"The hat is a  bit on the big,but otherwise nice."
4.0,"Quality first. What can you expect for this price? Whoa, these are well made and with somebody's label on them would sell for much more. I'd buy them again. In fact I might just do that. I bought the white and blue. They are fully lined and when wet do not become transparent. I'm generally a medium so I got the XL and they fit like a US medium. These are form fitted and will look best on a guy who is in good shape. Sorry, but if you've got more belly than butt look for something else."
4.0,Thank God I ordered larger size then needed and still feels a little short plenty of room in leg areas hips are comfortable bib is just little lower then expected but it might be design need to try out in cold weather for update
4.0,"This light weight blazer is beautiful...........the color was the exact one I was looking for............it fit as expected, but it is just a little too flimsy."
4.0,Its so pretty and delicate but... WHO IN THE WORLD DECIDED THE bottom SHOULD BE BLUE??? &#62;.&#60;
4.0,"I love how this blouse fits! My only 'but' is that the blouse is attached in the front (which creates the V) in an off spot. It's not like in the picture, but a lot higher, just slightly under your neck. It's very easily cut open though and that fixes the problem."
4.0,"Worth the $, only 2 problems: the pink beads would be MUCH cuter in red, and there are tiny wire &#34;hoops&#34; that scratch your wrist. I think it can be easily fixed with plyers"
4.0,Great buy for the price. Fabric is a bit thin.
4.0,It looks very nice but medium  was too large for small frame . Allegra runs correct size and I love their products
4.0,It is easy to wear & quite adjustable & looks nice.
4.0,The color was what I expected
4.0,"Everything came on time, packaged well, and exactly at described. Thanks"
4.0,It's a great length but it gathers or bobs at the bottom. That was a little unexpected but I'd like the white one now lol still good though.
4.0,"It's a beautiful dress & fits well. It has to be worn with a slip though, its very see through."
4.0,"I absolutely love the way the top looks. But it offers minimal support and while the material is very nice, it is on the thin side so the outline of the nipple is very easy to see."
4.0,"Like the size and weight very much.  The only issue is the middle zippered compartment, which makes it harder to find things."
4.0,Good quality leather strap. It helps to shape it first be fore buckling the first time.
4.0,CUTE WATCH FOR THE PRICE.
4.0,"Runs a touch small in the waist and the double layer front pocket design is poorly thought out.  However, these khakis are super comfortable and I love the front phone pocket. Definitely more casual than dress type khaki. Happy with them."
4.0,This watch serves the purpose of telling time for the price. The band is somewhat rigid and someone has to buckle the band until it softens up.
4.0,"It's great to hold my hair bands, but because I have small wrists, they tend to fall off when there's no hairband on it. So the problem is really with my skinny wrists!"
4.0,Great standby tie..
4.0,"Nice coat, comfy and warm."
4.0,Great material. Buttons were not aligned very well.
4.0,"I'd say it was a pretty good looking ring, the only problem was that it was too big. I had my fiance who hates wearing jewelry, sized at my jeweler. These rings may run big because i know he didn't lose weight. Just be aware of that if your size is an in betweener. I should have bought the 11 and a half instead."
4.0,"Soft and comfortable.  The sleeves are a little awkwardly shaped with the drop shoulders. The colors are bright and colorful.  Not a thick sweatshirt material, more of a thinner transition spring/early fall piece."
4.0,This dress fits very nice there’s nothing to change about this dress
4.0,Great coat. I am a small and bought a medium and it is still on the small side. I thought I ordered red but received black. It's warm!! Which is really all I care about. Good price.
4.0,This product is pretty in colors and and makes a good winter warm.
4.0,Wore for Christmas party loved it on and got lots of compliments.
4.0,nice  dress
4.0,"Cute, cheap ring. It really sets off your nice manicure."
4.0,Cutest little dress. Just too wide on the arm area and back for me.<br />I give it good reviews because the dress is very stylish.  The one person who will fit will be very happy.<br />I do believe it's a true to size in many ways.<br />I just didn't want to spend more on tailoring.
4.0,Could have ordered a half size smaller. The 7.5 fits bigger than other brands do. I didnt want to mess with exchanging and shipping back so I'll just deal with it.
4.0,It's nice but hoped it was just a tad bigger with bigger opening.
4.0,I like this other than one of the gems keep flipping the opposite direction of the other two.
4.0,Keep hands quite warm and can operate the dash touch screens.
4.0,Bought this for my daughter and she loves ❤️ it!
4.0,"The spot where you put the tie through, if not lined up perfectly almost looks like there’s a hole In the dress. And the dress arm holes drop down low showing side of bra.... other than that I’m in love!!!"
4.0,Wish it was available with a number on it...but it is what it is.
4.0,"They are super snug, but over all really comfortable and they give you a nice silhouette."
4.0,I liked it. It look like as an picture. For this money it is very well product.
4.0,"These seem to be nicely made, but I thought the crotch would drop lower than it does. I may be returning these. Still deciding. I don’t love them like I thought I would."
4.0,Just what I needed for workouts.
4.0,I am quite pleased with the delicate bracelet.
4.0,great shirt in design and color
4.0,"I have had lots of compliments - well made and roomy., but not huge."
4.0,Stiff material on upper part
4.0,"I got the green bathing suit in size medium and the color is very pretty. The top is comfortable with the adjustable double straps over the shoulders. I thought the bottom fit a little bit snug around the waist band, as compared to the top which was slightly big, but I like the full coverage of the bottom."
4.0,Overpriced but it is pretty nice!
4.0,"Love bottoms. Top poor quality and fit, but when matching bottoms with another swim top definitely worth it!"
4.0,Gorgeous statement earrings. They hang just tight between my chin and neck. Received so many compliments!
4.0,"Loved this one, even though the fabric is a little bit bunchy. Thick fabric and very bright color, just like the other Homeeye dresses I have. Was worried about the little detail at the hip not playing nicely on camera/making my hips look bigger, but I don't think it did.<br />Looking at the size chart, I probably should have gone a size smaller so that's probably why the fabric is bunchy. Ah well, you live and you learn.<br />For reference, I'm 5'7&#34; and about 135 pounds. I usually wear a 2 or a 4."
4.0,Cute but not very comfy to sleep in. I like them tho.
4.0,"I am currently 34 weeks pregnant @ 5'4, 160lbs, 34C - A size medium was perfect!!!! I wore this last night for the fourth of July Fireworks and it was SO comfortable. The length was perfect also, it was about an inch from the ground, just enough so it wasn't dragging or touching the ground.<br /><br />The only negative was that because of the stripes, when the top was sewn to the bottom, they did not follow the stripe so it's not straight.. but it wasn't too obvious when i was wearing it. I will probably sew it and fix it because it does bother me but really no one noticed because it's right up underneath the breast.<br /><br />The material was very smooth and soft - really stretchy! I could have possibly went to a small if needed as the arms were not too tight nor the belly. I will be buying more of these dresses!!!!<br /><br />Update 7/7/17: so I still love this dress but because it's made of mostly rayon (love and hate this fabric lol) it snags SUPER easy!! My skirt caught the side of a laundry basket and now it has a snag but obviously not the manuafactures fault. Just FYI to be careful!!"
4.0,"The pearls are smaller that I thought it would be, but still beautiful"
4.0,My sons teacher loved it
4.0,"These are dope, they look fire! The only thing I wish is that they were a little bit shorter. It’s a little too long, but I can still rock it! I dig them"
4.0,Absolutely adorable and stands up to my toddler. Only complaint- a little smaller than expected. Note that you can't machine wash it.
4.0,They are very soft and durable but they seem quite wide. Great shoe for meaty feet : ) true to size just run wide.
4.0,"This dress was a little long for me (I am 5'6) but was a perfect true floor length for my daughter (5'9). That was my only ""issue"" but I will have it hemmed. Just depends on how long you prefer your maxis. Fabric is soft and comfortable."
4.0,"This skirt is beautifully made! The stretch in the waist is great, it's a beautiful color, and the price can't be beat! But sadly, it was way too long on my short frame, so I had to return it. The length looked as though I couldn't decide between knee-length and floor-length, so I chose somewhere in the middle. The length was so unflattering to my legs, but the waist and fit of the skirt was very flattering and comfortable."
4.0,"Super cute! The pieces that sit on your nose make me a little sweaty in the heat. Definitely more of a fashion piece when going out. The lenses definitely do what they are supposed to. I noticed that when the sun is behind me, there is a little glare on the inside of the glasses. They are worth what you are paying for them and I recommend them to someone wanting to look cute but also wants protection from the outdoors. The case and little screwdriver are so perfect and I wish more glasses came with these items! Overall satisfied with this product!"
4.0,Sentiments and positivity in heartfelt messages were great.
4.0,"FIT: I'm 5'9"" 190 and a Large fit me great...Chest/stomach wise it's perfect. Hits my waist perfectly but that means it rides up when I reach or stretch. Sleeves are the same, hit my cuff perfectly, but that means they ride up when I reach. A fair trade off for a clean fit.<br /><br />LOOK: Nice material, has a rustic, flannel blanket look and feel to it. Pattern is done well. Colors are dull but good for that vintage look.<br /><br />COMFORT: Pretty cozy, moderately thick...Good for a third layer in Winter and a second layer in Fall."
4.0,"Have had these a few weeks. They seem decent. I bought them because I liked the relatively mild sole design, as opposed to the aggressive spiky-looking soles on most mountain bike shoes I saw.<br /><br />Also, the construction of the upper from the ball of the foot forward seems to have enough ""give"" to alleviate the numb toes that bother me sometimes.<br /><br />The biggest downside I've seen so far is the recess in the bottom for the cleat is not quite deep enough to keep my Speedplay Frog cleats off the floor when off the bike. Could use about 5mm more sole thickness. So, don't walk on your wood floor."
4.0,"Was a gift for boyfriend's birthday and it is great quality, color and size."
4.0,"Works well with homemade masks we use, aids in breathing and helps with prolonged mask use"
4.0,"I ordered the black short sleeve in a small. It came as pictured and fits fairly well. The fabric is soft and light, and the lace is soft too. My only complaint is that the sleeves are slightly snug, and for some reason the elastic used is kind of itchy but only if you're focusing on it. Other than that I'm quite pleased with this product."
4.0,"I liked that these are longer than usual, while the rest of the fit is true to size. However, they did pull a bit in the crotch (not something I've ever had a problem with before) and the hips poofed out a little (something I often have a problem with). I ended up sending them back mostly because they are just too thick to get much use out of here in South Florida - almost like sweat pants. The overall craftsmanship and fabric quality are impressive, on that they deserve at least 5 stars."
4.0,"Good looking dress for work but it's smaller,I normally wear a small but this one it's a little tight, maybe order a bigger size"
4.0,This dress was beautiful but it lower than I expected and a bit larger
4.0,"The material is actually really comfy, however, the pants wouldn’t stay on me while I was working out which was frustrating"
4.0,"I ordered the Youth Large size for my 9-year-old (who is on the small side for his age.)  It is pretty roomy and the sleeves are very long, but that's the way he likes it, and overall it fits him well with some room to grow.  It is pretty lightweight, so he wears it for style, not for warmth. He loves the zip-up creeper face.  The fabric over the eyes, mouth and nose is a &#34;screen&#34; type fabric, so he can see and breathe.  This was his favorite Christmas present by far."
4.0,So far so good.  Very clear view underwater.  Stays on my head without letting water in.  The clasp in the back is better than the ones that just have a rubber strap.  I just hope they hold up!
4.0,"I bought a half size up per the reviews and am glad I did. The shoes fit well with the additional room, but they're pretty wide and are a little uncomfortable to walk in because of the material (the back gripped the back of my ankle a lot). After wearing for a bit, these got much more comfortable and I could walk around in them for a while. A good deal overall and nice addition."
4.0,It’s hard to find a women’s dress belt without breaking the bank. I wanted leather with gold buckle and really struggled to find it. Purchased another brand a year ago that cracked and looked ragged after use. Hoping this is better quality.
4.0,"It's looser than I expected but it's super cute. The bow is useless, so I cut it off and wear with a wide red belt."
4.0,Very nice jacket but the outside fabric is a bit odd. Great blue color. My 6 year old loves it.
4.0,"The color of the spectacle lens is the color I expected, which is consistent with the website display.  Out of my expectation is that it comes with a glasses case which is good for outdoor usage even the frame seems fragile."
4.0,Worked for about a year so for the price I can't really complain. Comfortable soft band that stays on my wrist. Good for nursing.
4.0,"Love this model, looks like the real brand and is very comfortable."
4.0,These shorts are pretty comfy. Super soft. Great pajamas. But the pockets keep coming out and hang inside out.
4.0,Fit as advertised!  Works well for me because I am short waisted!
4.0,"Love this bag!! Good quality. Really nice size. Just had a funny smell, but went away after a day out of the package."
4.0,"The material is super soft and lightweight. The pants are a decent length, not too long or short, the shirt fits well with a little movement. I'm on the fence about the elastic used in the waist of the pants. It's super firm which is in significant contrast to the soft feel of the pajamas as a whole. Because of the firmness, the waist can roll or be just a little tight, even though overall the pants are true to size. I do wish the company would change the elastic to be a little softer to match the overall feel but in the end they are a decent set of bamboo pajamas for the price."
4.0,It's a t-shirt. Good quality. Not much one can say about a t-shirt
4.0,"Laces are well made and were only 3&#34; longer than the originals, however, the extra 1 1/2&#34; on each side makes a big difference.  If your boots require 60&#34; laces, don't buy the 63&#34; laces - too long!."
4.0,Great piece. So glad I found this to wear with my shirt.
4.0,Very good quality and an excellent value. The coin medallions were very authenic looking and I was able to get a better table at restaurants when wearing this belt.
4.0,It’s listed for toddlers and infants however it’s quite large & does not fit my 5 month old. Definitely more for a toddler. It’s good quality and very cute though.
4.0,Better than expected the only thing wish there was a button on the back
4.0,"The replacement kit for the Surge is of decent quality and well worth it for the money.  However, before purchasing, I made sure to read the reviews and some were quite helpful.  The most helpful tip is to make sure to be aware that the GPS chip (which is like a sticker) is located in the top band (on the top part of the watch) and will most likely come off the watch and be stuck into the band.  Make sure to pay attention to the direction that it is facing so that you can relocate it onto the top of the watch in the correct direction.  The replacement band will slide over it.<br />I also found a couple of YouTube videos to be somewhat helpful.  I never did find a video of somebody who ""knew what they were doing"" BEFORE they made the video.  That would've been helpful because it seemed like it was also their first time.  Suggested additional supplies are some double-stick or double-sided adhesive tape.  Some people used Rubber Cement but I did not have any.  That might help to seal the gap better, especially if the watch gets wet at a later date.<br />Also, as mentioned by one YouTube repairer, the T5 screw driver that comes with the kit is of very poor quality.  I made it through removing all 4 screw and replacing 3 when it ""failed""--meaning it would not put the screw complete back into the socket.  It is good for now, but I ended up ordering a quality set of small head hex drivers.  I figure that I they can come in handy for future projects that involve tiny screws.  I will tighten up the last screw when that set arrives (if I haven't already stripped the screw.)<br />I did not use the screws that came with the replacement strap.  I read that it would be best to use the original ones.  The replacement screws are a little bit longer, so I'm not sure how they would work.  I will keep them just in case.<br />The replacement strap is much stiffer and a little bit larger.  But I think it will soften up a bit and work just fine."
4.0,That is really good in the busy area. The longer part of the sports bra can roll up. It works really great if you have high waisted yoga pants on so it was pretty good for a work out didn’t roll up to bed with high waisted pants.
4.0,its okay but  wont last long though
4.0,"I love how the sender sent it just when I asked!!! The dress fir perfectly everywhere but the bust. I am a 32C but the top was made for a DD or larger! The back straps were too long but after some alterations my mom did, it was almost perfect.<br /><br />The skirt is VERY full. I felt like a princess the whole day! Very good quality and not cheap at all! I really recommend this seller, but just have the top altered if you're small chested like me."
4.0,It is a really pretty skirt.  I had to return it and order then next size up.
4.0,Nice bag very stylish.
4.0,"Pretty cute top, but not too pleased with the material and how it feels."
4.0,Smaller lense then expected<br />They are okay
4.0,"My 15 year old, 6ft tall, son, just loves this.  He has been sitting around the house in it even though it's the middle of summer.  He says it's very comfortable.  It was bought to have for pajama day at the High School and maybe even Halloween.  He liked catching Grandma off guard by answering the door in this thing."
4.0,"This one is comfortable, an accurate size and is well made. I would call this one a solid 4 star buy if you like what you see.<br /><br />Just my thoughts,<br /><br />AK"
4.0,It’s very light weight. The hood seems comfortable. I like it.
4.0,Quite sturdy and convenient
4.0,"These earrings arrived on time in a plain white box. I expected them to be bigger I don't know why because it lists the size but I didn't check. All in all, it's a good product for a great price they are very cute little earrings and I love the color. I am happy with my purchase even though they are smaller than I'd like. I would recommend checking to make sure they aren't too small for your preferences."
4.0,"My husband loved this shirt, he thought it was so funny. The material is soft and the graphics look good. I ordered his normal size M and it fit well."
4.0,"these are thinner than I expected, but I ended up liking that because if they were any thicker I could not wear them with jeans with my boots"
4.0,"Cute suit, the bottoms are a little too cheeky for my body."
4.0,"I've ordered this exact product before and loved it, however the one I received this time was a different material and the zipper pulley broke off on first wear. None the less the wear is the same and it'll do."
4.0,"loved the look of the dress, but I'm too busty for this dress"
4.0,This was a really nice piece for the inexpensive price.
4.0,"This product worked well overall.  I used it on my ski goggles, and it kept them from fogging up. The only downside is that the spray was only effective for about 45 minutes before it started fogging up...but I think it may have been more effective if I was not wearing a facemask. My sister also used it while snowboarding and said it worked well.<br />Overall solid 4 stars."
4.0,The three stars for sturdiness and durability are due to the fact that I won’t really know until I’ve used it for awhile.<br />Very stylish and reasonably priced
4.0,"These fit well and don't slip in shoes. One trouble is that the lace tears easily. But other than that, great no show."
4.0,"This dress is okay. As many people say, &#34;you get what you pay for.&#34; I am 5' 7&#34;, 170 lbs. and the size 10/12 fit fine however it is shorter on me than it appears in the picture. I had hoped I could wear it to work with leggings but that is doubtful."
4.0,The sleeves are so beautiful. The chest area fits as expected. I have large hips so naturally it's snug there but totally workable.
4.0,"Comfy, washed well in cold water."
4.0,GREAT BUY FOR THE PRICE
4.0,"Wear with work suits, good office, business staples."
4.0,Really cute. High quality denim. Just too small
4.0,"Okay, this was my favorite dress... Until I washed it. Now it doesn't even cover my butt 😭 I machine washed cold per the instructions but it shrunk A LOT. I will probably reorder just because I really do love the dress (comfy, cute, looks just like the picture)... But I will definitely order a size or two larger than my normal size 😔 I'll see if I can post a side-by-side picture so you can see how much it shrunk!"
4.0,"Fits well and is cotton, which I wanted.  Material does seem a bit ""thin"" but it has held up well over repeated washings and has not shrunk."
4.0,Impressive looking and not small at all. I liked the blue one more but that I think is a matter of taste. An excellent gift for the price.
4.0,I wish it wasn't so plain.
4.0,I think the fabric is a bit thin. I'll feel more comfortable wearing it over a tank top. I bought four of them for my tennis foursome and they really like them so it was worth it.
4.0,Happy with costume overall it was a little large.
4.0,"Nice shirts, very lightweight as I wanted, at a very good price.  To have comfortable shirts, I usually buy 16/16.5 with 34 sleeves.  So I ordered these shirts as XL.  When they arrived, the package said XL 17/17.5 with 35/36 sleeves.  They do fit fine, however, so for ordering purposes, they must run smaller than indicated size."
4.0,"The bows come off very easily, but can also be easily fixed."
4.0,"The necklace is exactly what you would expect for the low price.  I particularly liked that it came in a very nice box with foam padding which looks good for gift-giving. I did not expect that.  Colors are bright, chain shines but is obviously not expensive.  I would say for an early teen or older child this is a nice piece of jewelry.  I got it for my 15 year old granddaughter for Christmas and I am sure she will be very happy with it."
4.0,It's a little darker than I thought but that's on me.<br />Overall...not bad.
4.0,Looks exactly as it does on the computer.
4.0,"The socks are very adorable. I wish that my adult feet were smaller so that I could wear them, because they are much too large for my daughter's size 10 toddler foot.  The designs are all intact and super cute, and quality is nice. 3 stars for sizing, 5 stars for esthetic/quality. 4 star average."
4.0,"Beautiful ear cuff, Quality not otherwise the best but ok."
4.0,"Looks a lil frumpy on me, but they’re excellent pajamas and super comfy"
4.0,Perfect holiday sweater ...
4.0,Very nice fabric makes this sweatshirt/tee shirt a winner.  I should have ordered a size 3X instead of a 2X.  The hem around the bottom of the shirt is too snug on me.  I was just a little too proud of my recent weight loss and really wanted that 2X to fit great.<br />I like the weight of this sweatshirt a lot.  It is lightweight but surprisingly warm when wearing it in chilly weather.<br />Highly recommended
4.0,One of the bands I was using broke rather faster than expected.
4.0,Very cute and made my outfit edgy. It did tear a little though
4.0,It has met my expectations.
4.0,Fits most size sunglasses & is easy to remove & insert the glasses.
4.0,"I love it! The wire is very strong and the charms very nice. unfortunately, i have already lost one of the charms in only 2 weeks"
4.0,"For a size 9, these were a little more snug than expected, but the material is not so substantial as to be uncomfortable. Considerable stretch, but so far seems to maintain shape. Had hoped for a higher cotton content, but this was as high as I could locate in a Champion. The thinness of the material make these socks very light and airy, but gives me pause concerning their durability. Probably a VERY good sport sock, not so good a work sock."
4.0,They were quite a bit softer fabric than I thought and not as fluffy in the sole as other pairs I've had but the flip flop thong fits in the right part of the shoe for my taste and I'm really glad I found these
4.0,"I have a Michael Kors tote in the same color and texture and LOVE IT! From the picture I thought this would be like a smaller version of that bag but It is actually 2 zipped sections snapped together. When unsnapped there is a middle section for credit cards, change etc. It's a cute bag but not what I was looking for so I returned it."
4.0,"Hi. , pockets are Not wide enough or long enough to fit or hide my iPhone 6 for  the purpose I needed it. It looks nice & i wear a large top and ordered the xl. The reviews helped me pick a good size for me!"
4.0,Good all around wristband. No complaints.
4.0,"Looks beautiful til you get it, then it's worth what you paid for."
4.0,Very Nice and good to add on to my outfits
4.0,"1.  NOT an off-the-shoulder, I can't imagine why they say that.<br />2.  Soft, thick fleece.<br />3.  The ruching is very flattering, and you can adjust it with the drawstrings.<br />4.  Great as a dress, or with leggings."
4.0,great price.  beautiful dress.  a little long on me.  Had it shortened and cost was more than the dress.  I did buy 3 different colors.  it will not go out of style
4.0,very pretty and as pictured. only complaint is that the ball and heart pairs r super tiny.
4.0,"Very nice, however fell apart after getting wet in shower for weeks. It's ok, I'll buy another and never get it wet. Lol"
4.0,I bought this as a birthday gift for my granddaughter. Got her the 2T/3T and it looked too small so I got her a 3T/4T and gave her that one. Returns are easy. Thank you Amazon!! The outfit is super cute. Just wish the sizes were exact not a blend of two.
4.0,"Looks very nice, but is for a small head."
4.0,I really like this dress. It is super comfortable. It's not see through. It was a little bit big on me but I don't mind. The material is a good quality and soft.
4.0,Looks great! Not going to use it in the snow currently so it doesn’t ruin my bag. Love it!
4.0,"These mittens are great for light and medium duty like going from house to car to shopping, but would not hold up to cold weather winter sports. Perfect for what I wanted these for."
4.0,"the robe is nice, not to thick, it is warm and very soft, the color is nice and it hits well even for me at 5'6&#34;, like that it had pockets"
4.0,I liked the look and feel of the material and the graphics.
4.0,"I like the mask, fits well as an adult. Only thing is it has a very strong latex smell. Rinse it out a couple times a week and that should help eliminate most of the oder."
4.0,Works good.  Sunglasses fit easily.  A little flimsy.
4.0,I love this dress it fits great easy to move material so soft
4.0,"Very pretty ,top a little tight but should be fine  soon. Thank You,"
4.0,I typically wear a size 4/Small.  I had to order a large in this suit.  The large fit great though and was very flattering.
4.0,They look nice and had a cool backing to make it easy to loosen and tighten. The colors are nice and bright and get a lot of compliments about the looks.
4.0,"This swimsuit is very cute, the colors are bold and vibrant and provides great coverage. I had read some of the other reviews prior to purchasing and saw that many had suggested ordering a size up from the normal size, so I went with that and found that it is slightly too big however I think I can put a little tie at the neck when I wear which will help the small amount of slipping that occurs the way it is now. Either way it will still be cute and exactly what I was hoping for in ordering this product. With beach season around the corner and family vacations coming this will be a perfect addition to my packing list. The shipping time took significantly longer than expected, but overall it is a great product. I would highly recommend this product to anyone seeking a nice bold, vibrantly colored suit for the summer, that is not too revealing, just order true to size and not a size up as the top is somewhat large.<br />I received this product for my honest and unbiased review, my reviews are always based on the product itself and not the price I pay. Like many I rely on honest reviews when making purchases, if you find my review helpful please click the thumbs up to let me know."
4.0,These things work well!
4.0,Very nice I like the pattern and how everything can be organized. Velcro was a little hard to lift up at first.
4.0,"1: It's squeezes really hard on the card, making it slightly difficult to stretch to take out or put back in cards.<br />2. The clip end is still very rough and sharp at the tip. Could potentially cut through skin if negligent.<br /><br />Overall satisfied by the product however since it's very slim. The industrial look is very cool, but sadly not worth carrying it in my back pocket since its metal."
4.0,"It looks well made and very detailed. My one disappointment was how small it was. I was expecting a larger medal, but it will work well enough for what I need."
4.0,Foot stars for style and material but it just didn’t fit well on my body. Sadly I returned.
4.0,"Had to return twice because of sizing.  These run TWO sizes small.  They are great and worth the trouble of returning.  Granddaughter is between a size 13-1 finally purchased a size 3 that fits perfectly!  Product itself is 5 stars...light weight, flexible and super cute!!"
4.0,"Good job blocking out the sun, lens a little large rub my cheeks not the most comfortable fit."
4.0,I know these are made to be oversized but it's a little too big.
4.0,Yo pedir otro color
4.0,"Very pretty, well made ring.  Runs true to size.  I gave this ring four out of five stars because of the stone color.  It is a nicely cut stone and flawless, but I had hoped for a stronger color blue.  That said, the intensity of the blue varies according to the light and it does have a bit of a sparkle under the right light.  Very comfortable to wear,  A good ring for everyday occasions. :D"
4.0,"Very pretty, a little large.  Looks great with white. Will order smaller size next time, if it holds up well in the washer."
4.0,Shoe for three year old. I don’t expect it to last long but he loves the lights. Only issue we have is that the strap across foot unfastens frequently when runs. The design should have longer velcro strap to ensure it stays on.
4.0,"I bought this bracelet to use with my Casio MDV-106 &#34;Duro&#34;. Others have reported good success with it. I did carefully re-work the end links as much as I could to obtain a better fit to the watch case. This was not as successful as I had hoped. As others have noted, the spring bars will likely have to be bent slightly to fit this bracelet to this particular watch. This was certainly true in my case. For me, this bracelet represents good value and complements both the style and the frugality of the MCV-106. If the end links had fit better against the case, I'd have given it five stars."
4.0,"measurements are accurate! neckline naturally dipped a bit low for my modest teen, however, if you have ANY sewing skills, it's a quick fix. 2 quick darts in the bust brought the neckline up enough for my daughter to wear in comfort without affecting the drape and flow. 2 more quick tucks at the shoulders closed that gap as well. great fabric, easy lines meant easy altering, so give it a try! super cute little dress, basic black goes everywhere, but my daughter did say she liked the other prints, thinking i'll purchase more!"
4.0,"I like this top it is soft, and the color was as expected. It leaves a nice open part all down the arm. I would like it to be a bit longer but overall I really do like that the arm is exposed all the way down in a flirty way.<br /><br />I did receive this at a discount in exchange for a fair review."
4.0,We ordered the item at the last minute and it still managed to arrive before Christmas.<br />The earrings were in excellent condition and the little girl we bought them for were ecstatic with the look and feel. The design was nice the price was just right.
4.0,With the price point I didn't expect much but it's good. Nice product for the price.  Good gift type item.
4.0,I purchased these because I've had a hard time finding beanies/hat that will fit my now 5 week old son.  The quality is great but it runs a little big.  I ordered these based on one of the reviews but I guess it didn't work out for me.  I'll be keeping them because for now I can fold up the beanie to fit until he grows into them.
4.0,"Very cute, but it fits true to size OR maybe a touch smaller than your true size. I typically wear a 12-ish, so I ordered a 12/14, and it's quite a bit too large.  Just stay true to your size...or if you waiver between sizes a bit, go for the smaller size. It is very cute though!"
4.0,Good fit.  Only wish it had more pockets.
4.0,"This hoodie does say it's for men, but though I am a woman, I decided to give it a try anyway. I most often wear a women's large, and that's what I went with for this hoodie, too. It is loose, but it's also thick and bulky. The hood doesn't fall down the back very far, which would have made it look better. It's just big and bulky at the neck, making it look a bit awkward. My husband tried to help it fall better into place, but there's not much help for it. The strings on the hood were super thick and odd looking, too, so I removed those completely. Though it's not my favorite hoodie as far as fit goes, it is super soft and comfortable, especially on the inside. I do love the purple color, too."
4.0,"I bought this for a very colorful skeleton costume that I was to wear outside in very chilly weather. I wanted a mask so that I didn't have to worry too much about make up and have warmth. This was perfect. It's light weight, but snug. Since wearing it as a costume, I have used it for a last minute headband too and it actually stays put! (Which rarely happens for me when it comes to headbands) I love this mask and will continue to resuse it whenever I can!"
4.0,The color wasn't what I expected and the length wasn't as long as I thought it would be. The size was correct.
4.0,"Our little thing to measure the water on the reverse osmosis system was left on, so we run out of batteries. There where hard to find, and expensive, but this ones did the trick, very happy with purchase"
4.0,"Overall pants are comfortable to workout in but length is not what is pictured.  I’m petite so they are more ankle length then calf length, which is why I initially bought these"
4.0,Instead of a band that has to be pulled for tightness it would do better with a band that snaps otherwise the band loses tension and it isn't all that wearable after a couple of weeks. But I loved it before it began slipping off within week three. The stone is nice.
4.0,"Great product, but runs a bit loose on me personally"
4.0,I was rather impressed by how fast this wig came! Wasn't expecting it until July but it came in June. It is a little scanty in the back but a little bit of styling takes care of that. I also like that it has the adjustable strap!
4.0,It is a bit small ladies with a larger bustline go up a size. but it is a very cute top
4.0,I love this pendant. It was a little smaller than I expected but what I wasn't expecting was to see such detail in a small pendant. I received so many compliments. I put in on a long silver chain and it was a beautiful accessory and with all the colors it really is versitile. Very pleased.
4.0,"I like the bands and they fit well. Only disappointing factor was the ""yellow"" band was actually a bit more of a beige color. Still gonna wear it so not a big deal."
4.0,This is a great shirt and I have worn it with pants and skirts.
4.0,"I ordered this for my granddaughter to wear under her 1st Communion dress. Fits good around the torso but the length was about a half inch long, so I had to use fabric tape to pull it up a bit.  It that doesn't &#34;hold&#34;, I'd recommend small safety pins as a back up instead. She loves it! She normally wears an 8 or 10 in dresses depending on the fabric....ordered an 8 in the slip.  If your child is husky around the torso, I'd recommend to order a 10 in the slip.  The lace on the hem adds a nice feminine &#34;pretty&#34; touch!!!"
4.0,"Dress is very beatiful, but too small on top and a little long. Im 5'8'' and 38DD and i ordered size 16 returned it for a 18. I love it! Definitly worth it."
4.0,Will respond back with it’s durability
4.0,Works as expected and looks like pic. Great price!
4.0,cup size was smaller than expected.
4.0,"My son loves them, they are a little bit long in the arms and legs but he can grow in to them."
4.0,"Gift for my niece, she loved it"
4.0,I have really enjoyed my butterfly sunglasses.
4.0,"Great, just wish they went a little higher on wrist. Definitely fits big"
4.0,"These are good novelty, I don't think they will hold up more than a month of heavy use but they are a good gift and for light use these should last a decent while.<br /><br />Just my thoughts,<br /><br />AK"
4.0,I bought this as a gift for my brother and it's pretty good. Arrived in a nice metal gift box and color is expected.<br />He loves it when he wears jean as it can be dressed up/down.
4.0,"Arrived early, was as expected but inner seam was weak and upon removing ID insert wallet seam split."
4.0,Live the product the only exception is no fleece.
4.0,"It's a little small, but I can wear them. They're all right. They are light weight and not sweats, which is fine for the spring."
4.0,"This necklace was absolutely adorable. The Magic Dust jar seemed à lot smaller than I expected. Should always pay attention to the dimensions. My daughter really wanted it and didn't even look.  However, it is wonderful and looks so good on her. As soon as we got it we put it by the lamp to charge it real quick and it glowed very brightly. You could even tell it was glowing without it being very dark. When you put it in the dark it glows very bright after being in the light.  I would definitly recommend this to anyone wanting a little fun and fashion together. Very steam punk."
4.0,"These slippers fit just as expected without being too big or small.  The sole is textured and water proof.  Memory foam cushioning allows for the slippers to conform to your feet.  However, it wore down within a week leaving my feet feeling as though they are walking directly on the soles."
4.0,So cute with many pockets! A bit small for my needs so I am returning. The red color is as pictured. There’s a slight fishy smell but will go away over time if you leave the purse out in the open.
4.0,"Very sexy and warm. I had to go a size up because the Large I would have worn was too short for my arms, I'm 5'9 and weigh 178lbs. The XL is long enough for my arms but I would have liked it a little smaller around my upper body."
4.0,The jacket is adorable except that when it arrived the holes for the buttons were not cut out. It was an easy fix but a bit annoying.
4.0,I love it! The description doesn't tell you that it's sort of hollow in the (not completely though) and that's the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars. It got here faster than expected and I thought it was really nice that the seller took the time to hand write thank you on the receipt! Will for sure be purchasing more ♡
4.0,"Most reviews said to order two sizes up, as well as their sizing chart. I would recommend only going one size up though as the 2xl was way too large on me. Luckily it fit my best friend just fine and is honestly good quality for the price. Would recommend"
4.0,I USED THIS TO COMPLETE A CLOWN HAT
4.0,"Used it today while out cycling. A little snug around the belly area, but pleased with it. Zipper seems solid. Thin material, but I live in the south and so I don’t mind. I usually wear a large (my shoulders), but the x-large was the way to go for this. Ordering another one."
4.0,Bought to wear over prescription glasses when I go to dirt track races.
4.0,"Mask was a hit but it does run small, I had to cut the chin strap, and the cheeks and nose and but back together, it just was way too small for my face, but it was perfect for my Halloween costume"
4.0,Much shorter than anticipated.
4.0,They're alright
4.0,These shoes are okay to wear for a couple hours but I do not recommend them for long wear as they tend to cause blisters.<br />I wish they had zippers!
4.0,Material quality could be better
4.0,"VERY COMFY AND COLOR IS JUST AS PICTURED...FITS GREAT EXCEPT IT WAS A LITTLE LONGER THEN I WANTED OR I WOULD HAVE GIVEN 4 STARS.......I FORGET HOW TALL THE MODLES ARE.  I'M ONLY 5'4&#34;.  BUT EVEN WITH THAT IT IS PERFECT FOR WEARING AROUND THE HOUSE OR A QUICK TRIP TO THE STORE,"
4.0,"Pretty good pair of boxer briefs.<br /><br />The support hammock was a little weird when I first saw it. There's a slit with two mesh fabric folds that feels vaguely inappropriate to insert yourself into (see orange lined mesh in the inside-out pic in this review).<br /><br />But once you get past the novelty of this design element, they are really a comfortable pair of underwear. Thin material, as advertised, but doesn't feel cheap. The front opening is secure with lots of fabric overlap, so you don't have to worry about anything escaping. I was also pleased about the length of the inseam... Not too long, closer to the look of some underwear advertised as trunks. Fit was as expected for medium.<br /><br />At $25/pair I would have expected the seamwork to be nearly flawless, but there were loose strings and some ragged edges on one of the pairs. Luckily these defects aren't structural and they're on the inside, so they don't impact the outer appearance. There's also a long, rough tag inside the underwear which doesn't make sense. You can cut it off, but why is it there to begin with?<br /><br />All-around solid underwear. Am anxious to see how they hold up over time."
4.0,Great fun item
4.0,Very cozy sweater and it washes very well. I put mine in the washer and dryer on normal cycles. A little fuzz first wash. This is slightly larger than expected but I am just wearing it as a cozy house sweater
4.0,"Super cute, looks just like the picture. Comfortable too, although it is a bit large on me."
4.0,This hat served the purpose. It was comfortable. I wore it to a funeral. I would buy it again.
4.0,good for what they were intended for a parade i marched in
4.0,Takes a few days to wear enough to be a good buy.  Only issue is that its pretty thick not really for a back pocket.  but quality great and I like the item.
4.0,They’re smaller  than I thought but cut. Good price
4.0,Favorite purse. Does have chemical smell but went away after being aired out
4.0,Tight but adorable
4.0,I'm just here for moral support. this is the watch I had when I was a kid. The comments are hilarious for this watch right like nobody really cares that you paid $15 for a watch but everybody has this nostalgia for it. Casio makes great products for everyone actually it's like the Toyota of watches.
4.0,Just okay. Nothing special and not roomy. Color is great for me.
4.0,I like the brown purse but I really fell in love with the Blue...bought both!
4.0,"I love wearing earrings and when I saw these I thought they were adorable but when my package arrived they were much larger than I expected, still would recommend this product  although if you have sensitive ears this may not be the product for you because they are large and heavy. I will still wear them I just won’t wear them as much since they are so big."
4.0,"dress runs a little small, but it is very comfortable . I like the weight of the fabric, & you dont need a slip under it. I bought it in blue and it is  as pictured in color"
4.0,It was not a true ref
4.0,"This top arrived on time and is just what I was hoping for.  Nice fit, cute lacy edge on bottom and back!"
4.0,"The quality was really good and felt just like normal sports jerseys. However, I would recommend getting a size up because although the jersey fit fine, the shorts were kinda small lol. Anyways overall good product"
4.0,"These earrings were a lightening deal impulse which I'm very happy with.  They are beautiful in person and look really cool in your ears, I've gotten compliments and questions about them every time I wear them.  My pair came with stoppers but I didn't feel it necessary to use them, I tend to check and adjust the earrings while I'm wearing them but they pull quite tight so I haven't been worried about them coming out.  I don't leave them in to shower or to sleep so I can't speak to those habits, mine are in nice shape, no tarnishing, no green, all stones still accounted for.  So far so good."
4.0,Love my new band. It's great quality!
4.0,The fit was amazing and I received many compliments. The only issues were the zipper getting stuck and the sheer part for the &#34;skirt&#34; was incredibly long.
4.0,"Great looking dress that you can wear whit nice accessories for a more dressy look or with flip flops for an everyday look. 4 stars because the quality it's just ok, the material is kind of thin but can't beat the price"
4.0,Love the fabric and the color of the stress but it was a little small fitting through the bust and body area. I'll re-order in a larger size and then a different color
4.0,It was exactly what I ordered for my daughter...
4.0,Very cute - a nice gift for a girl.
4.0,"***Very warm arnwarmers, when I am at work next to windows and working on computertyping,  always wear them .  Love them .Thank you ."
4.0,"Very pretty but picture is kind of misleading. They're a bit small & flat not very 3D, like the picture shows. Good purchase anyhow. (:"
4.0,Nice glasses. They're cool looking and polarized. They help a lot with glare and dimming the right sun.
4.0,My feet are really narrow and they are a little wide for me but I have that trouble a lot. Otherwise very nice sandal!
4.0,It looks like the picture
4.0,I got it for my friend and they loved it
4.0,This earring is adorable but i had to use superglue to attach the metal to the actual earring..  it looks just like pic .
4.0,"The belt that comes with dress is RED ! Also I took it off the dress to add to something else, and it broke before I got to wear once. The dress it self is great. Comfortable and fit as expected."
4.0,Looks and works great. Let's me be playful
4.0,great looking watch and fair price
4.0,Beautiful color and design! Just a bit shorter than I would like.
4.0,"I love this wrap!  The color and size is perfect.  However, it gets 4 starts because it's made out of acrylic, which is a little itchy.  I tried washing it before using it and it did not help with the feel."
4.0,Got this for my son for a costume party and he loved it. It looked great also. It is a skinny tie and is amortization the money.
4.0,"it looks good! but the bloomers didn’t fit at all, and the hat is shaped weirdly. the pompom is also yellow? other than that i’d recommend! :D"
4.0,Bought these for 5yo who wants glasses like her sister.  These have held up well.  A bit big for young kids but she doesn't mind.
4.0,"I got these because my vegan leather ones I had were started to crack and fall apart. These are a great alternative to leather and fabric bibs.<br /><br />What I like about this product:<br />- Made of Food grade silicone<br />- Made without  BPA free, lead-free, BPS free, Phthalate Free<br />- Easy to wash/wipe off, and dishwasher safe<br />- no drying time!<br />- Durable material<br />- Large/wide Food catcher<br />- love the colors<br /><br />the only downside so far is that sometimes it could be difficult to button without getting my daughters hair caught in it"
4.0,It works great! No complaints.
4.0,"I ordered this top to have a casual, but professional item to wear to work in the summer season.  I like the style of the top, with its cute neck cut and sleeveless design.  I also really love the soft and flowing style and think it is appropriate for work as well as out and about in a casual setting.  The quality of the top is nice.  The stitching is secure and I like the vibrant pink color that I ordered.  The material is nice.  It is very soft and flows nicely to flatter your figure.  I did not anticipate how sheer the fabric was.  An undershirt must be worn and it shows through so not just any tank is sufficient in my opinion.  The sizing was as expected.  I am 5'4&#34; and weigh 115 lbs.  I ordered a medium and it is a bit large, which is normal since normally I wear a size small.  Overall i like the shirt and am happy with my purchase. I should mention that I was fortunate enough to receive a discount for an honest review of this product."
4.0,"Plain, simple and well made."
4.0,Great for cold mornings and taking the puppy outside. Buy one size up as advised.
4.0,Love these tops. Have not tried to wash yet. That will be the true test.
4.0,Good fit. Especially in the front pouch.
4.0,The price was very low but the shipping took so long it deflated the whole experience.<br />I never received these.<br />I ordered another pair at the same time from another buyer.  It arrived quickly.  I got several compliments but they didn't last very long.  Snags from shoes and what not.<br />Yes I would order again but  I would readily pay for upgraded shipping  in this case.
4.0,Love the quality and the length! It is beautiful and exactly what I was looking for. The white is a little see through. I normally wear a medium so I'm not big by any means but ordered an xxl bc of other reviews. Glad I did! It is actually a little tight on me but I am going to keep it because it isn't so tight that it looks bad.
4.0,Beautiful and great quality. Product is exactly as seen in the pictures.
4.0,I bought these for my daughter for Christmas. I was nervous at first but then i read the reviews and that is what sold me. Right afyer she opened them she put them on and she loves them. I will say this they fit as expected they are a littke tight bit other than that they are super soft.
4.0,"I like them, however I assumed (never assume) that there was a nylon net underneath the black webbing of the sock.  My error, but I will be wearing them anyway!"
4.0,The stone scratched and I thought it was supposed to be a very hard strong stone
4.0,"Fits short and tight around waistband. I am 5’2” and 125 lbs and I got a M and it’s so much smaller than my other jerseys. Doesn’t fit comfortably. Material is pretty thin and slick as well as light weight, wouldn’t really recommend to anyone else"
4.0,This is adorable and of very good quality. The bead accent really enriched the look with the cranberry color.
4.0,"The shark tooth pendant that is pictured is a beautiful piece of jewelry, but the ""merchant"" states that it is a Great White Shark.  It is really a Hemipristis, a Snaggletooth shark, which is much prettier than a Great White.  That is the only thing wrong with it.<br /><br />Judy Goldberg"
4.0,i like it but i don't love it.
4.0,"The purse is a lot smaller than i expexted,did not even consider the measurements,but i like it still."
4.0,Comfortable. Not very tight fitting
4.0,"These sunglasses are very cute.  They are oversized as described, which I like and the pattern on the glasses is nice.  They are polarized which is great for driving and overall vision but I have one complaint; the bridge on the glasses where it rests on your nose is just metal...there is no cushion at all so if you are wearing these an extended amount of time they will start to irritate the top of your nose.  I can wear these in small spurts but definitely not for long wear unfortunately.  That is the one flaw in the design, but other than that they are very nice looking."
4.0,The product seemed like good quality and colors. The light blue looked a little different then what I was looking at. Good variety though.
4.0,not to bad may buy again.
4.0,The dress is beautiful but runs very small to size
4.0,It fits true to size and the fabric is nice and thick. My only complaint is that the waistline is a little higher than the picture.
4.0,Bag is just the right size for every day. It is lite and can hold all I want for every day. I really like it.
4.0,"Beautiful dress! Ordered for NYE Party and was not disappointed- unfortunately, it was too big. I am 5’ 4”, 165 lbs and ordered an XL based on reviews. I am returning the dress for the next size down & hoping it’s a better fit!"
4.0,cute shirt.  sleeves are pretty long
4.0,"The Good:<br />  I like the small compact size of this case, yet I can get a lot of stuff in it!  I can fit 4 credit cards, driver license, AAA card, 3 insurance cards, an emergency $100 bill and five $20 bills!  It is so small that I can easily keep it in my front pocket and hardly notice that it is even there!  No more sore back and butt from a fat wallet in my back pocket.  It should also block the credit cards from scammers, so that is a bonus.<br /><br />The Bad:<br />  The clasp on this is sketchy at best, if you put as much as I did in it, you have to carefully arrange your cards so the embossed numbers are the minimum thickness.  Also fold your money in thirds and crease them sharp.  Then it will close, but I also put a rubber band to help keep it more secure.<br />  The finish is a fingerprint magnet and I can imagine that it will scratch very easily as there are already some scratches from just getting it setup.  But you could always cover it with a plain vinyl that you can usually get a free scrap from a sign shop.<br />The edges of the metal when opened are a bit sharp. I think for the price, it is a bit too expensive.  It seems more like a $5 product.<br /><br />Overall:<br />  I highly recommend this if you can downsize your junk and want something small, this is pretty great.  It does have its tradeoffs, but for me it just works!"
4.0,Very soft and comfy but u must wear long shirt because material is thin.
4.0,Very nice fit and love the fabric.
4.0,"The ring came very quickly and is very pretty.  The fit is perfect.  It is band is much thinner than it looks in the photo but for the price, it's very nice.  you probably wouldn't want to wear this everyday--I don't think it would hold up but for once in a while--it's really pretty."
4.0,"Beautiful colors, I also bought a second print.  Fabric is soft.  Just need to know that they run small.  I bought XL & it's form fitting.  I usually wear size 12-14."
4.0,"it's exactly like in the picture, but i am not sure if it is real stanley steel. Because it weight less than other original watch that I bought."
4.0,I really liked the color of the backpack and it is so much cheaper than a Kanken mini! I would highly recommend it! The only thing that makes this item a 4 star-rating is because it had a smell to it.
4.0,Just as pictured. Gave as a gift.
4.0,"Good hats for the price. Wish they were a bit deeper to stay on the kiddos heads better, but overall pretty good."
4.0,"I must have really small ear piercings because the posts on these earrings were a little thicker than normal earrings and I had to struggle to push them through my holes. I don’t wear earrings every day, but I do wear them often enough where my holes don’t close up. After stuggling putting these in for a while ( and my ears all red) I finally got one on and though it was pretty, it blended in too much and didn’t look good...but to be fair I believe it to be more a personal skin tone/earring color issue. I think these would look lovely on someone else."
4.0,Fits good just hard to put on my ears lol
4.0,For a resonable priced watch it is comfortable and easy to setup.
4.0,Sizing just a little off. Good customer service
4.0,"Dont know why I was asked to rate stretch. It was not a stretch fabric. It was a little heavier fabric than I was expecting for a summer romper. I bought the same size as a different romper, and I could not wear this one. little too small."
4.0,"Super comfy but they run small, so definitely size up!"
4.0,Very nice watch. Everything works very well. I'm actually wearing it right now. It is a thin watch. It has a nice real metal weight and looks fantastic. It was a good buy
4.0,"The cap was a good fit, and looked as expected..."
4.0,"I followed reviews and ordered a size down, it was way too small! Order true to size"
4.0,"These were at once a lifesaver and part of the annoyance of my first trimester. The ginger ones were gross. Wish there were options to not include them.<br />These actually did help me. When I started feeling nausea I could take one and get it under control. However; they didn't make me impervious to bad smells or the occasional bad day for nausea. I do feel like they saved me from throwing up on multiple occasions (even if not every time) so that was significant. But they don't get rid of really bad nausea, either. Heck, they did not ever get completely rid of the nausea at all.  Sometimes I felt like they helped immensely and other times I felt like they barely took the edge off. But there were several times that edge made all the difference between me keeping my meals down.<br />I have purchased two separate batches at different times and noticed some differences. In one batch, the raspberry ones were a very light pink, and in the next they were a very dark pink, really more of a red. Not a problem at all, just an interesting variation.<br />In the second batch, the green apple and ginger ones looked different enough that I could visually tell them apart. The green apple ones were kind of green.<br />In the first batch, though, the colors were so weak they both looked light tan and consuming one was like ginger roulette. Would it be palatable apple or disgusting dirt flavor?<br />By the end of my first trimester I was using them more sparingly even before the nausea went away because I began to associate their flavor with nausea, alas. But that's not the product's fault. They really did take the edge off of the worst part of my first trimester."
4.0,Great full face shield but the dark eyelets make it hard to see in low light.  But great look! Very thin as well.
4.0,I really do like the masks.  They are comfortable and I have received many compliments.  My only complaint is the ear straps do not stay on my ears and end up just getting tucked inside.
4.0,"Fit is small, but looks nice. the lace peeking out from the shoe looks nice"
4.0,Runs about a size or two bigger. I ordered an xl and is way to big for my husband
4.0,"looks just like pic, love the little ears. Bought as a gift for my friend who loves anime. She was stoked. Socks are actually thicker than I expected them to be."
4.0,Wish it was a tad bit thicker. Color and size true.
4.0,"I'm not in love with this top.  I usually wear an XL and that is what I bought but it was much too tight for me to wear in public right now.  That said, the lace doesn't seem as if it will easily rip and it is comfortable.  It is stretchy also but still much too snug.  I'd recommend buying a size larger than typical.  The color is exactly what is shown in the picture.  Overall I like it, I would recommend it to others because it really is super cute."
4.0,"The opal looks exactly like the picture, maybe even more beautiful! The only con is that the gap was too big for my nose, but that's an easy fix. Other than that, I love it"
4.0,"For the price totally worth it, it's what I needed for skiing. It's not very flattering but in the cold who really cares"
4.0,Dress is a bit staticky and sticks to my legs but it looks nice overall. However I ordered two sizes because I have a larger chest and not always sure what will fit best. The XL barely fit over my chest and was very tight but the Large fit perfectly and even had some extra room. So beware of the sizes when ordering. Mine were definitely mislabeled.
4.0,Kinda heavy and continues to streach your ear cause of the weight
4.0,"it's such a  soft boyfriend fit t-shirt, very very comfortable!  the only thing with this shirt and most white shirts they are a bit thin so you have to be very careful about what you're planning to wear under.  i would go for a nude color, but even then when this shirt hits the skin you can see a bit of it.  either way, i do like the shirt... it's loose enough that it's not skin tight to see clearly what's under."
4.0,A Christmas gift for my niece<br />I liked it but it was a little smaller than I expected
4.0,cute and dainty
4.0,Simple and comfortable but easily wrinkled.
4.0,Very cute dress! Fit my little girl perfect and is decent quality.
4.0,"I wrote 4 stars because of the little piece to hold the earrings are made plastic and come off easy, so many times my earrings go to tge floor, good that I realized right away."
4.0,They are nice and warm with a flannel lining.
4.0,"It is a simple gold necklace with a good weight. Exactly what I wanted. Except, the color is an orange gold instead of a yellow gold. The picture looks like what I expected but what I got was darker. Not so dark that I would return it, but I definitely noticed the color when I opened the packaging."
4.0,"The jersey is great but runs small. I also wish I knew what was on the back. Overall, I’m satisfied and recommend to buy a size larger than you normally wear to play in."
4.0,This is a gift for somebody who likes railroads nostalgia
4.0,Good shoes to walk with.
4.0,"Super soft. Great quality. I’m 5’4”, 160lbs. Initially bought medium. Had to return and get a small."
4.0,I ordered this for my son. It's very comfortable and light weight.
4.0,"This is a very cute, light dress.  It is flattering and I love the pockets. The material is soft and the dress seems well made.  However, the material is a bit thin so be warned. Still a beautiful dress and one I would not hesitate to purchase again."
4.0,Had the watch for a few weeks now and hasn't lost any time yet. Gave it a four star because it was a real pain changing the size for the watch.
4.0,"The description says ""Material95% Polyester and 5% Spandex, Ultra soft, Tummy Control, light and very durable, easily washed and quick-dry.<br />Imported<br />Button closure""<br /><br />These are very soft, light and quick dry.  Sadly, there is no ""Tummy Control"" to be found.  There also isnt a 'button closure' but I expect that is purely a mistake.  The pants are very lightweight - (translation -a bit see through)  They are warm, which will be a bonus in the winter, though it isnt right now. They definitely cling to every roll, bulge etc.<br /><br />Overall, they're your basic lounge pants.  Suitable for at home wear or perhaps a walk around the neighborhood."
4.0,Great dress. Well made and beautifully colored
4.0,Great product would recommend
4.0,"Okay product. Cheap material that’s just meant for looks, not for walking."
4.0,Overall I am very happy with this product for the price point.<br />I ordered this for fishing in the river and I used it yesterday with no real issues.<br />I had been wearing shorts under the hip waders and doing that was very uncomfortable because of the stitching around the boot top was rubbing on my legs. Once I put sweat pants on under the hip waders that was a non issue.<br />The only other thing I didn't like is the pocket at the chest inside should have a zipper or a way to close it. If you bend over to pick up something everything will fall out of the pocket.
4.0,I wish this shirt was heavier. It wasn't advertised as heavy so I'm fine with it. Quality printing.
4.0,"I'm a waitress at a super busy higher end restaurant and was recommended these from another girl I work with.  I've never been one to buy clothes online because I ALWAYS have to try things on first.  Nothing ever fits me the way it should. But I took a chance and ordered these because of the way they fit my coworker.  Super stretchy and soft.  I ordered size medium based on what my friend ordered because I'm smaller around the waist and in the behind than her. And whatta know!! They fit PERFECTLY!!  They are just the right tightness and stretch wonderfully with my body.  I DID however have to buy a belt and keep it pretty tight snug to make sure my shirt stays tucked in all day.  The pants seem to fall down off my hips amd belly just a little after a few hours of work.  But the belt helps perfectly with that.  THE ONLY reason I didn't give these all 5 stars is I wash them probably every other day, because they're the ONLY comfy pair of workpants I own now, and after about 5 washes or so they shrunk a little in length.  But not so much that its bothersome.  I will DEFINITELY  be buying another pair of these soon! Most comfortable pants I've ever bought for work!"
4.0,"I would echo the other comments that I saw here (and didn't heed as much as I should have).  The sizing was a little small, but it should work for the limited time that this will be used as a costume.  My child is about 5'4"" and thin.  we bought a large.  I envision a sans costume with an oversized hoodie.  So, this actually fits my kid just right (not oversized).  If i had to do it again, I would have ordered an XL."
4.0,we use these for my daughter who is 4 and still wets the bed. these work pretty good but do smell like pee in the morning which to me feels dirty to have in her bed. i put up  with it because I'm done buying pull ups for bed. she is a heavy soaker and these  don't leak so thats a plus.  i would buy this again
4.0,"Love this dress, it fits so well"
4.0,"I ordered the hat in blue and was happily surprised to see that it is reversible. I don't know if it's meant to be, but it is. The reason I gave 4 out of 5 stars is I wish the inside was a more vibrant contrast, but seersucker is still a nice alternative. The brim is big enough to adequately shade your face, ears, and neck, but not so wide that it interferes with vision.  The ponytail opening is wide. The material is light so your head doesn't sweat. The brim has wire in it, so you can mold it, plus it keeps the brim from being too floppy. At $8.99 it's a good summer bargain."
4.0,I was pleasantly surprised! It is spacious for a little bag and it is absolutely precious. Might get another.
4.0,My daughter loved it and it was cute easy for her to put on
4.0,"The only thing is that it rubs on the back of my Achilles, but other then that they are really nice."
4.0,No surprises.  Warm and comfortable.
4.0,Great fit! I got a small and I’m 5’3” 125lbs<br />Unfortunately it doesn’t come with instructions for the straps but I was able to find a video on a review for the same costume different seller and was able to figure it out. The small belt like pieces belt together and snap onto the shoulder and breastplate. The shorter of the long pieces goes around the thigh and the long piece around the waist with the buckle facing the same side of the pouch. I’m super happy with this costume. I bought the sora wig and oblivion keyblade to tie it all together
4.0,"This dress was waaaaay too long for me at 5'2. I don't have enough torso or leg for it.  It stretches nicely and is very comfortable fabric, but doesn't work at all for my height."
4.0,"These actually feel pretty solid. I have a big head, and they fit exactly as I wanted, i.e. they are not the tiny 1960's John Lennon type glasses. They shipped faster than expected (from Asia.) They were perfect for my Eurythmics costume."
4.0,"I just got the dress. Yes, it see through. I got a XS because I wear size 2/4 . This XS is size 10 so yes, was big on me but will keep it."
4.0,Bought these for my wife and she loves them
4.0,It's exactly what it says it is 🙂
4.0,"I have a large chest so I need stretchy fabric or at least a size larger than I would normally have to wear in shirts and dresses. I also have fibromyalgia and wear sweats and yoga gear a lot. I was looking for a good quality, black longer sleeved shirt that would be comfortable as well. Past reviews let me know that it ran small so I ordered XXL when I would normally order a large or X-large. I was very excited to get this product, but when it arrived it looked like a medium or at the very least a tight, small large. Luckily I have daughters who were able to wear it.  I am giving it four stars because it is a good quality for the price and it does fit nicely on a smaller breasted woman."
4.0,The color is darker than what is shown. Great quality of product. Fits perfectly on my 10 month old!
4.0,"I like the fit of the hat, but the hat had a strong odor. Also, the brim was bent inward. i sprayed Febreeze on the hat and hung it in my laundry room. In a few hours, my laundry room smelled bad. I had to put the hat outside to let it air out. The smell seems to be gone now.  I hope it doesn't come back when I wear it."
4.0,"i love these pants I have bought 3 pairs.. the only problem is when you wash them the material changes and the shrink a bit.. I washed one pair on cold and hung to dry and it happened, so i washed another pair by hand hung to dry and it happened again.. they are still good and fit just not as good as the were before i washed them.."
4.0,"I fell in love with this bag but at $180,it was too pricey. Then amazon had it for  $120. But, I had a gc and rewards to cash in so I got it for $20. Loved it even more. Just big enough for my wallet, phone and keys. Its so much prettier in person. The only drawback for me is the strap is too long."
4.0,The stitching is well done. But a little more than I would have liked to spend for a ball cap.
4.0,The slippers are cute. But it says the Large fits up to a 11 women's but not my 11's. They are too tight but so cute<br />I will keep them and give them as a gift.
4.0,Very nice just too large
4.0,"These slippers look good, I like the color,but they were just  a bit too short to be real comfortable for me; the next size would have been to large, hence I sent them back.  I ad another pair, Oberm Womens Mens House Slippers Slip on Winter...and these fit perfectly."
4.0,very lightweight and comfortable.  nice for summer.  has a stylish impact but is understated.  like for casual wear. glad I bought it.
4.0,Fit well material comfortable I like It.
4.0,Hits just above my knees - I'm 5'9- and is perfect for the beach or a hot summer day.<br />Loose enough to camoflage tummy area.
4.0,"Fits as expected,  I'm 5 ft 9 so the dress is about 6 inches above my knees"
4.0,"Arrived on time. My dress had a bit of a stain, so it definitely had to be washed before use. Afterwords it was clean, it fits great hugging the body at the right places."
4.0,"I wore one for three days, it broke last night. But nothing a little glue won't fix. But I like the length, the colors are cool, and they fit together nicely. All in all a good buy."
4.0,This shirt is adorable and so warm. The only reason it gets 4 stars instead of 5 is because it has a few areas of bad stitching. But it's still adorable. I just don't dry itbecause I don't want it to get worse.
4.0,Nice sandals the fit around the area before the toes is a little spacey.
4.0,"I meant to give it a 5 star, but hit the wrong star! I've bought Foster Grant before & they seem to last longer than some others."
4.0,"Easy to put in boots.  A little hard to zip until broken in. Great price, good quality"
4.0,"The straps are velco, but the shoes are working very well for my daughter."
4.0,This bracelet is so light weight and full of shine. It really catches the eye. So many compliments when I wear it. It can be worn with a casual outfit or a night out.
4.0,Love this cute charm
4.0,"Runs a little small waisted, empire."
4.0,You get what you pay for. Some of the credit card slots are to tight to put cards in. I hope they will loosen over time. The design is cute and the color is great. The only pocket with a zipper is in the center of the fold so you can't put a lot of change in before the wallet doesent close well. Overall cute and functional for how cheep it is
4.0,Sun glasses have a very nice color tint.  Much better than the $5 to $35 sunglass readers I have purchased.  The polarizing lens is good.  The glasses wrap around completely to keep out side light which is nice when you are driving and the sun is setting on your left.  Hinges seem solid which has been the failing point of many other sun glasses I've owned.
4.0,I think the model must be 5'2 to 5'5. If you're taller these tanks will sit about top to upper hip. I like that I got so many. And they're good construction but I like my tanks longer.
4.0,"This is nice.  A little on the pricier side for the quality.  It is definitely thing enough to see through even when dry.  It doesn't quite close all the way but I have a large chest.  Overall, I would recommend."
4.0,"Really nice belt , good quality"
4.0,The finger lights are a fun twist for the kids to play with. They are inexpensive and seem to be useful in many ways.
4.0,The quality of the black is excellent. Fit as expected based on the fabric composition. Love. Will buy more.
4.0,"For a small size, it is kind of big."
4.0,Very comfortable and they're holding up well.
4.0,Great size. Super cute. Sort of a canvas feel. Hopefully it lasts!
4.0,"Great looking jacket, good waterproofing. A few criticisms: there aren't enough pockets for a winter jacket. The inner jacket isn't very well attached to the outer shell, and so often feels loose and moves around a lot when you wear it."
4.0,Prone to wrinkle.  Like the pjs otherwise.
4.0,"Really like this animal print and the fabric is good, especially at this price.  It is a modest, comfortable cover-up."
4.0,a bit small for an xl but love it
4.0,shoe fit really nice love it
4.0,"This dress is very comfortable, the color and fit is very cute! I love the way the fabric is gathered at the side. The only thing I don't love is that the cling of the fabric means that bra and panty lines are obvious in the back.  I have PCOS so have a little bit of a belly that looks a little like a baby bump, this fit is extremely flattering on my body shape.  I am 5'5' and 190 pounds and fit fine in a large."
4.0,"I liked the jacket, it was warm. However, the pockets are flat and there is nothing keeping anything inside. I lost my new phone due to this."
4.0,I loved the look of these boots just not the fit! They were a bit big for me though. I ordered my normal size and I had way too much room even with a sock on.
4.0,"Great quality, I will buy more glases for this seller"
4.0,receiver loved it! I don't know if it was worth the price because other than the pendant its pretty plain but they liked it so it was worth it.
4.0,Super cute but it doesn't breathe at all. If I were on a beach in this I would be way too warm.
4.0,These are NOT PUMA brand sneakers!!! It is my mistake for reading it wrong that's why I still gave a high review!! Delivered a day early and they are kind of still cute..
4.0,"The watch is gorgeous, but the strap is very stiff, even after multiple wears."
4.0,Touch screen is perfect
4.0,Did not block out as much light as I wanted.
4.0,receiver liked it
4.0,Fits perfectly and the material of the shirt is super soft and the shirt can be pulled up so it's not as low cut but it definitely is going to show some cleavage (even on someone like me that has barely anything there).
4.0,Hip size is fine but a little tight around the waist. Order one size larger than your usual size.
4.0,"It is very cute but extraordinarily sheer. And it doesn’t stay in off the shoulder mode very long, it immediately pops back up over the shoulders. If you were to wear this in public you would need a full undergarment, it even shows your bra very clearly. However I live by the beach, so I will be using it to go out to lunch, dinner etc while wearing my bikini under it. It’s a good dress to wear for beach bars, or to a pool party."
4.0,"Love wide pants, but dislike it doesn’t look like the pants in the picture."
4.0,"It's a really cute belt but the fake leather material isn't very durable, I already have a couple if cracks in it"
4.0,"These shorts are perfect. Im 5' 8"" and 130 pounds and i ordered a small. they're very breezy, and perfect for summer! the material is a little cheap, but otherwise, great shorts!"
4.0,"Pictures show sock bottoms, but what came was velcro bottoms. That was disappointing since we prefer sock bottoms so just know you may not get what's actually pictured. Other than that, we've used Tuffrider breeches for years and find the they hold up very well."
4.0,"I like the fit and the extra fabric protecting the zipper is great. The padding inside it a bit thick but so far has gone back to shape after washing with no trouble and does not stand out while wearing workout clothes.<br />Downside, the Zipper does not lock in place and has a tendency to slip down. This has not happened while working out, just walking around I start to feel a bit free and if I'm lucky ill hear/feel the zipper going while it is still near the top and easy to fix."
4.0,Little tight. Hard to get on
4.0,"It is soft, it is warm when I wash with hot water. Easy to use, just put dish soap on gloves and wash . It helpful for washing dishes or cups were made from melanin and stainless Steel because really slippery, you can drop anything. It is no smell, do not like the other gloves that have a rubber smell will stick to your hands. But I still recommend buy it for normal use"
4.0,This top is really cute but the photo is very misleading. The photo makes it appear to have more of a blouse effect but it's 150% just a regular jersey.
4.0,The chain is a little small but im  ok with it; it still fits ok...
4.0,nice but not worth the money.
4.0,"Cute, slightly smaller than expected"
4.0,"The only reason I can't give these 5 stars is because they are very short in length. I'm 5'6"" and they are too short. I will return for a larger size because the material and comfort on my legs is great, no seams and comfortable. I just need an extra 4-6"" in length and they'd be perfect."
4.0,"I have been using this for about 2 months. I really liked it, the leather is good quality and it has plenty of sections/slots for credit/ID cards. It also has room for paper money and coins. Obviously I don't carry a lot, no make up etc. It has recently been rendered useless. The strap to purse connectors??? I thought they were metal.....the purse was pulled from me and one of them was stretched and would not allow closure, the strap kept falling off..... I thought it was metal and asked my husband to re-tighten it with plyers, it broke and appears it was plastic? There is no other way to fasten the strap to the purse, so I am left without the use of this mini bag."
4.0,"I would have given this 5 stars had the sizing been correct. I would suggest going up a size unless you like the snug/tight fit. Overall it's a great shirt. It tappers in just under the bust giving you a great shape, I can see this being very flattering on any figure or size. I would purchase again and definitely would recommend."
4.0,"Nice sweatshirt looks cute on, I personally don’t like the feel of material but that’s a personal preference"
4.0,these are very tiny but good for a third earring hole and made well good for the price.
4.0,"I liked the feel of the glove, could not wear them because they were too small. Exchange them for another pair but they sent the same size again. So gave them to someone else who could use them."
4.0,"I'm short so the dress comes about mid calf or just below. The chest part is cute, better for bigger chested, I'm small side and it flattens them lol I dont really like the material, its thick and stiff feeling."
4.0,"True Polarized. A little big for women's face, pulls hair out on one side when taking off. They are well made and light, Comfortable to wear but the arms are a little long."
4.0,"So, the shirt wasn't quite what I expected. I thought the fabric would be of smoother quality. My son liked the fit of it but returned home and asked for me to help him take it off immediately because ""it keeps rubbing my skin."" It was clear that the shirt rolled up around the waist during the day which annoyed him as well. I'm trying to think about how to modify it so that he can enjoy the compression without the itch."
4.0,"I got two of these dresses, and I love them. I am 5' 130 lbs and purchased a small. It fits nicely, although I'd like a little more room in the upper sleve area."
4.0,very kool retro look
4.0,They are faded on the front. Would have liked them better if they were not.
4.0,ordered these for my 8 year old who would love to have pierced ears but isn't quite ready They are a perfect size for a little girl and stay on well. She says they are pretty comfortable and leaves them on a good amount of time.
4.0,"nice dress, great for church with a cardigan."
4.0,Looks nice and are good quality
4.0,"Was not enough materiai.not neat but still clorfull.u can't make full dress.u have to buy  more piece of fabrice,depends if u can get the matching color ,which is not easy😐 but the colors r great"
4.0,I bought these as a gift and the top is too small but the bottoms fit her just right.
4.0,I like this handbag. It is a little larger than I am used to but I like it.
4.0,Nice fit and she loved it🙂
4.0,"This is a very comfortable shirt, and just what I was looking for to pair with leggings.  It's flattering, and the only reason I didn't give it a 5 is that I think it's a bit overpriced.  But, I'm keeping it!"
4.0,"not bad,,, some leaking present but not much"
4.0,A very nice set
4.0,"These bands have been extremely comfortable and have stopped the rashes I used to develop with my old watch band. However, I have worn one for a couple months and already the middle rose gold strip has faded to a very pale color."
4.0,Bought these for baywatch theme. Glasses come exactly like the picture.
4.0,Love the looks and feel of the band.  The length of the strap runs long.  If you trim it you will not have the same finish on the edges
4.0,"I am 34 C and I ordered cup C and ir did not fit. I recommend to size up. Costumer service was very kínd and dedicated helping me with this issue. Very good attention, eñxcellent service! The quality and materials are great."
4.0,"It was a premade costume purchase, so it was what we expected.<br />We cut some stuff off and made some adjustments but it looked great overall.<br /><br />For the price, it was a good deal."
4.0,"The suit top was a bit too small, but it is as pictured.  The bottom fits fine."
4.0,Does it’s job and stays put! Perfect for spaghetti strap or backless tops and dresses. Used many times and it’s still sticking.
4.0,"I am a bit chesty (38DDD) andit is a bit hard to get myself situated in the top of this suit, its definitely possible though. Not sure if all hell will break loose once I am in water though. Cute set nonetheless"
4.0,perfect for what I am using for.
4.0,Turned out to be a bit smaller than expected.
4.0,Very cute. Small enough for a 6 year old to wear.
4.0,The fit and color was as advertised. The fabric is very soft.
4.0,"Quality is really good. I haven't worn it yet. Colt is dead on, length looks good. I look forward to wearing"
4.0,A bit big since the fabric is slightly stretchy.  But overall looks good.
4.0,"Pretty, well made. A bit too boxy"
4.0,"This dress is light and breezy, and perfect for summer! It is a large fit but the belt helps to give you some shape. Definitely recommend for an easy summer outfit."
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:d8d9befdc832e43a40cc58c15e7149e0]] Unfortunately, I received the wrong size of ring but it’s still very beautiful and shiny and the cut is absolutely gorgeous its still able to fit on my pinky finger but its okay ill make it work. Its still a stunning ring  that came with a box and a gift bag to give to that special someone."
4.0,Too large but pretty color and style.
4.0,I wear a size 6 shoe so I have a small foot; I still like wearing these.
4.0,"The zipper pull broke off the first one we ordered after only worn two times, but the company, after we sent a photo of the broken zipper pull, gave us another same jacket that has worked well and is warm and comfortable.  My husband likes it very much."
4.0,"Cute dress w quick shipping. Nice length and shape for something quick to wear out to work, dinner, or shopping."
4.0,This is a long dress that has a high slit.
4.0,"Really cute, light weight and my ears feel fine when I wear them, however you can tell they will break easily so just have to be careful."
4.0,More peach than the blush color I wanted.
4.0,Really cute took awhile to get here but fits perfect!! Smelled a bit weird and was hard to get the smell out but other than that perfecto!
4.0,"I bought this and the packaging was good, but the chain broke within 3 days."
4.0,"Comfy, warm, attractive"
4.0,"Like someone else said, the pictures don't make it obvious how sheer it is. I selected this type of swimsuit, because I wanted to hide my stomach. Kind of wasting the style making it so see-through, and to me, the images are misleading."
4.0,"The transaction was smooth.  The socks were a little smaller than expected - wondering if maybe they were for children and not adults. Wish that had been stated. But, I will still wear them.  The arrived when expected"
4.0,"Only comment is that the shoe chamber is a little small for my shoes, but I wear a size 13, so that was to be expected.  This was just the size I needed."
4.0,"absolutely love it! I have trouble finding clothes that fit me right as I am a 5'8'' slim female, men's long sleeve clothing is usually longer in the torso and arms. A small fits perfect, it's a little big but you can adjust it to make it tighter. I only gave it 4 stars because I really don't think it's worth $112. I have a women's Mt. Hardware jacket that's a lot thicker and it was under $90. if I wasn't 5'8'' I'd probably buy something way cheaper and just as nice."
4.0,My daughter picked this out for herself and she loves it . Good quality fabric . Neat packaging
4.0,"The price is quite good considering the number of pieces in the set. There are 3 that are good sizes and have mesh tops to see what's in them. They hold enough underwear for 10 days with no problem, plus one can hold 7 large men's collar shirts.  The unfortunate thing is the other pouches have Laundry printed on them. I'm using them for other articles. They are hardly big enough to handle any laundry."
4.0,"Although I thought the dress would be too colorful, I received many compliments. The dress is comfortable and runs a little bigger than actual size. Would have given it 5 stars, but muy dress did have a hole in it that I chose to sew up myself instead of having to go through the hassle of returning."
4.0,Would like to have another color.
4.0,"Didn't come with the shoulder strap as shown. Dan from Vooray's customer service was awesome to work with and sent one out to me immediately after getting my email about the issue. The bag colors aren't quite as vibrant as in the pic, but still a gorgeous bag! The leather accents are gorgeous. Love the separate shoe compartment and it's super roomy, definitely recommend!!"
4.0,"I love these slippers, i wear a 9.5 and ordered the XL and they fit perfect. They are super soft on my feet and keep my feet warm from my tile floors. They have a hard sole so i can wear them outside to walk my trash out ect. The only down side i found is they don't have any cushion in them so they are a bit hard on my feet but for the price i can't expect everything i want."
4.0,It’s really pretty but it should of been send in a box they was bend
4.0,Good fit. Material is a bit too soft for my liking. Pants are long but ok in heels.
4.0,Good quality bead. Works on my Nina Queen bangle bracelet but not on my Pandora.
4.0,It was very well-made thank you
4.0,Beautiful soft material and fairly good workmanship.
4.0,"GIven as a gift to my brother for his birthday.  He said it is a bit large, but really comfortable and well made."
4.0,"I do like these and will be ordering more. The only thing I would say that's negative is they bunch when sitting so when you stand back up, you'll have to pull the legs back down."
4.0,"Liked the dress, descent quality"
4.0,"Really liked these earrings, used them during Christmas time as Mrs. Claus earrings."
4.0,"Lights up, slight noise but believe they all do that . Good to go best mask for the money"
4.0,"You shouldn't get tapers for anything past 00g, but these have helped my stretching. These are massive, and have a horrible jump. So you will need to wait a while before going to this size."
4.0,This is the second I ordered.  The first one was too big.  I could not return it because it was beyond the return period.  But I am happy with this one.  It is very comfortable.
4.0,the neck piece was way to tight and didn't come apart. So I cut it and put red elastic there and solved problem
4.0,"These costumes were really fun. They take 4 AA batteries, and you have to attach the fan yourself, but really, it wasn't hard to get started and out the door. The fan blew up the costume fairly quickly, and we had so much fun!<br />The only issue we had was with the plastic for the face.<br />At first I thought it was a great idea, and a way to avoid wearing a mask on Halloween during Covid, but when it came in, we had to cut away a mesh lining that covered up the plastic and made it nearly impossible to see through.<br />Once the mesh was removed, the plastic was clear, but it gets dirty and scratched up fairly quickly. Visibility becomes ZERO when it gets dark.<br />But we didn't pay a lot for these, so we did get our money's worth, and had a blast while trick-or-treating."
4.0,"Cool item, not the bling bling..."
4.0,I wouldn't consider it &#34;slim fit&#34; in style but it still fits nice. I'm satisfied. Nice color and the material seems to be of good quality.
4.0,"Very nice purse/clutch.  Sometimes you need a purse that will hold just a bit more then a clutch will, but you don't want a huge purse or bag.  This is the perfect mix.  This woven pattern is a subtle classic style and will look great with whatever outfit you are wearing at the time.  Although small, it's big enough to hold all the necessary essentials. The inner lining is very nice, the fabric is strong but elegant.  There are a few pockets to help organize your items.  There is ano adjustable strap so you can wear it on your shoulder or disconnect it to use the wrist strap or place it under your arm.  I love the color, it accessorizes wonderfully.<br />I do reviews for sellers on Amazon, and usually get a discount for the products that I review, and I did as well, on this item.  However, don't mistake my reviews to be based on discounts.  I am 100% honest on what I say about an item I am reviewing.  I read reviews before I purchase an item, I want to know what's good and bad from people that have purchased ahead of me.  I stand firmly in my review on this purse.  It's a great but.<br />DISCLAIMER:  I received this product discounted in exchange for my honest and unbiased review."
4.0,Loved this hat but would have liked it to have arrived in a protective storage box.Finding a protective storage box for that hat height isn't easy pr cheap.
4.0,real small
4.0,Well made and great item for the price. Only thing I found frustrating was setting the time and dates. There were no instructions included.
4.0,It’s too short for this 40 year old.  I wanted it for Easter Sunday but unfortunately will have to send it back. I’m 5’6
4.0,Ery nice value. Not as polished as I'd like.
4.0,"At first I was worried because I just saw the drawstring bag but everything was inside and in great condition. I posted a pic of the medium bag and its current holding 1 skirt, 10 tops, and more. Some of the threading is coming out and these are defintly not top quality, but they were cheap so you got to expect that. But they'll do their job and I'm very impressed."
4.0,"This is an attractive looking matching watch set that would make a nice gift from a boyfriend to his girlfriend for Valentine's Day or to mark a special occassion. Each watch has a  black dial which is textured in the center with tiny hearts, and inlaid rhinestones form one half of a heart which forms a whole heart when the couple wearing them holds hands. The men's watch contains the letters &quot;Lo&quot; where at the 3 o'clock position, and the women's watch has &quot;ve&quot; at the 9 o'clock position forming the word &quot;love&quot; when they come together.<br /><br />The watches feature a glass lens, a Japanese Quartz movement, and stainless steel bracelets with push button deployment clasp closures. It's pretty easy to adjust the bracelet size yourself if you have a link removal tool ([[ASIN:B00HTU4OB0 Leegoal Watch Link Remover with Pins (12pins)]] )  to push the pins out with. According to the manufacturer's description, the watches are water resistant to 30 meters (99 ft), so they're safe to wear when washing your hands or caught outside in the rain, but not to swim or shower in.<br /><br />Overall it's a cute inexpensive watch set that's most likely to hold more appeal for a woman than for a man. While a man might find the lovey dovey hearts and &quot;love&quot; a bit too sentimental for his liking as a daily wear item, the romantic sentimentality of the set will endear him to the woman he gives it to.<br /><br />Sample provided directly by manufacturer for evaluation."
4.0,The shape of the dress isn't flattering.
4.0,These are super cute! Only problem I had was one of the boots were laced wrong because one of the clasps that hold the lace was messed up. They're wearable and the broken clasp will still hold the lace. (maybe slightly better than the others?) and also if you have bigger ankles they won't fit. They will look weird. I was very disappointed when I couldn't wear them because of that.
4.0,Not as brightly colored as picture appears.
4.0,"For 16.99, it's a steal!  Only issues are: 1-the pins are a micro millimeter short. They did come out once, I pinched the clip with pliers just a hair and it's been ok since. 2-The release button is too easy to hit, thus I find myself re-closing the band too frequently, maybe I can reverse it and have release closer to elbow rather than the hand side.  3- Micro adjustments just are not there, so the fit is ok, but not great. I do recommend it though."
4.0,"Like most of Patty Boutik's clothes... they run a little small. I really like the design's in clothing such as the longer sleeves and length. I'm 5'9, 140lbs with a chest size of a 36C. Bought the dress that looks like this top and fits the same"
4.0,"The overall design is sleek! Ratchet mechanism has a fair locking strength but can be pulled apart with very little force. Hence, if waist size is a 44inch as advertised this length will not be conducive for excessive movement and size change in waist due to eating."
4.0,Nice material and cute style. This does run at least a size or two small but I considered that and it was fitted. Very nice
4.0,"a bit longer than expected, but thats just fine so she can wear it longer. cute pattern, good quality fabric. Stitching is a little messy but not bad."
4.0,"These socks were a little big. I was hoping the band around the center would be a little supportive but like I said, they are big and I have a womans us size 10 foot so.... would not recommend if you have little feet 😅<br /><br />Edit: these socks fit a lot better after being washed a few times!"
4.0,Quality is decent and the drawstring is small enough so you can wear an overlapping shirt or too and most people will not know these are drawstring pants! Very comfy. Perfect for travel.
4.0,I bought them for my daughter. She loves them. Thinks she's a pop star.😂😂
4.0,A gift for my daughter for her birthday.  She really loves them and I am very pleased with the purchase.
4.0,Love this too so much. Really soft and fit perfectly! Would definitely buy it in other colors or even for a friend or family member.
4.0,Easy to find on Amazon
4.0,"My expectations for this were kind of middle of the road. It wasn't too expensive and I'm always in need of sweaters for a chilly office. Great length and big enough to wrap around me for extra warmth. I have not washed it yet, so we'll see how it holds up, but overall - this is pretty nice for the price."
4.0,I love it it's kind of small tho
4.0,The sandals are cute and comfortable but a bit bulky and a bit wide.
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:74de21fa9039ddddd33973b1604060f3]] Good quality. I don’t feel like the top of the pants will roll down. I wish there were an XL, maybe bc of my Fupa lol. I am 26 5’6 last time I weighed was 200 lbs and I ordered Large. Pants and top nice and stretchy"
4.0,Seems to work well. Good value
4.0,Great Christmas presents thank you....
4.0,"I love the shape of the feathers and the length is great. It's a very versatile piece. Still, while I think two-toned jewelry can work, I don't love it here."
4.0,"Fits as expected, not amazing quality but good enough"
4.0,"It met my expectations 100% cotton, I ordered it large when im an medium but solely for the purpose of my project and future growth. Its very comfortable to chill in all day, warm, cosy and well worth the price. Weirdly enough large was a perfect size especially if you have a partner slightly bigger or smaller than you. :)"
4.0,"The pink was only one shade instead of two, and the other one wasn’t supposed to have pink in it at all but still really cute !! The dum dum shaped ones have a lot of white in them. Hearts are adorable !! Good size and light weight"
4.0,"Very comfortable and not too heavy do it can be worn summer, winter, spring and fall.❤"
4.0,Cute hat!  Am perfectly satisfied...
4.0,soft and comfortable; love this brand
4.0,Love the convenience and magnification.  Great to read simple things like a menu.  Wish the chain was a little longer. Would have given 5 stars if it was.
4.0,Nice weight. Stones are very dark...almost appear black.
4.0,"They stretch really great which makes them extremely comfortable. Only thing that would be better is if they were 3/4in. shorter,"
4.0,On time .. I like it ... Now let's use it 👍🏿
4.0,Bonito pero un poco fragiles
4.0,"Very cute shoe and surprisingly very good quality for the price!  I'm a 8.5 and the 40 fit very well, although I think the shoe might stretch. I read other reviews to buy a size up in this shoe. I like the hidden heel, it's a great look. Shoe is stable to walk on if you're accustomed to wedges and very comfortable. Has a bit of very unpleasant plastic smell (my whole room smells) that I hope will air out."
4.0,Nicw goggles.  Too bad the instructions were HORRIBLE  on how to get different prescription strength.  I wrote to the manufacturer but still haven't heard from them.  A product.  F customer support.
4.0,Love this mask wicked cute girl my fiance the jack one my mask however is pretty large and the print doesn't really line up its also a bit thick for work but all in all decent mask
4.0,"I love the skirt, the color, the flow and the design.  The only issue I have is SIZING. I have returned several of them because the sizing is about 2 clicks &#34;off&#34;; where I normally wear a size large, I have to order this product 2 sizes larger."
4.0,"Was purchased for a school musical. It was used for a male student, and his Mom was to wear it after the play. This product is not cut for women with curves. Unsure if going up in size would work."
4.0,Good material you can pull on and won't break or dig into the skin. Only draw back is the waist belt for the tail is a little short but can easily be modified.
4.0,Nice but some letters were missing jewels:(
4.0,My nieces loved them.
4.0,Bought for costume but wasn’t able to use
4.0,"Great shirt, runs small but perfect for our party! I normally wear a woman’s XL, bought a men’s 2XL hoping it would be big and baggy but you can see in the picture it’s not all that big or baggy."
4.0,Love the dress don’t really like the sleeves had to tweak them a little
4.0,"They are not exactly the same as the original keeper and the fit isn’t perfect. However, they are cheaper than a new strap and will allow me to get a few more years out of my watch without buying a new strap. Overall I’m happy."
4.0,Large size way to tight. Suggest Xlarge for size 9-12 foot
4.0,I do love this bralette & the way it looks. The lace isn't itchy unlike other bralettes I've had. My only complaint is that the material that fits below your boobs is a bit thin and digs into your skin a little bit.
4.0,"Bought this luggage prior to a cruise. It looks great and I really love this set. The only issue was that the side handle on the largest piece broke. Other than that, each piece rolls smoothly and is roomy. The four wheels make it easier to maneuver compared to two wheel pieces. We have used a few times since purchase. I also like how they nest which saves room when storing."
4.0,Much larger than expected!  The chain is poor quality but the snitch is enjoyable.
4.0,"reasonable price, no distracting numbers, good for counting pulse and respiration."
4.0,Was my products received? Greta bra just to thin material for my liking but great coverage
4.0,"These were listed with waffle-weave shirts and I blindly ordered.  These are merely long sleeve T-shirts.  I'm sure they're fine, but for the price, it's too much."
4.0,"It is a nice little item. It is nothing fantastic but I was not expecting that . It is a cute item, very dainty. It is what it is."
4.0,This dress is super cute and very comfortable. I'm all about a dress with pockets. Great price too!
4.0,Nice quality earrings. They are smaller and heavier than I expected. Still cute and comfortable to wear.
4.0,These are really cute.  I had just recently purchased an almost identical pair in black and wanted another option.  Comfortable for several hours and seems to give a moderate amount of eye protection.  There were a few scratches on the side plastic (not on the lenses).  I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review.
4.0,Is a beautiful pink pearl and I ordered it for my birthday because I adore the pearls
4.0,A good price and very colorful! I bought these for my &#34;A case of bad stripes&#34; costume. I had many compliments and they kept me warm!
4.0,"Shoes were true to size and color. ive been wearing them a lot to work and out in the snow, and i have yet to see any wear and tare. very durable!"
4.0,Works great with another chain/lanyard (never used the one that came with it as other reviews said it was not great so didn't want to risk it). I've used it a bunch and it has yet to come out without me trying to get it out of this case.
4.0,"The fact that these fit me is an absolute miracle. I am 5'9&#34;, and weight about 200 lbs, so I was very doubtful when I saw that these only came in two sizes, but still wanted to try them because I had heard great reviews about them. They fit me very snug, but I can still get into them. They fit almost like nylons/tights would, where they are very tight at the top of my thighs, and fit well elsewhere. It does take a bit of time for me to get into them, but honestly I still can't believe I can even shimmy my way into these. The material is very soft and stretchy; it almost reminds me of the fabric that expensive running socks are made of if that makes any sense. I got the gray ones, so they are not see through around my butt, but are a little bit see through at my calves because the fabric there is basically white. I would not wear these for leg day though, because I am afraid that I am just going to bust through the seams if I so much as do one squat. It would definitely be beneficial to them if they expand their size range."
4.0,"Nice looking, good quality, comfortable<br />A great deal for the money<br />I would purchase again"
4.0,Perfect for what I needed it for. I don't see how you would &#34;charge&#34; the luminous as it typically sits inside your pocket. It gets the job done.
4.0,"Love the style, only complaint is they slide down my nose...I'm sure I can fix that easily!"
4.0,Cute but a little “thin” but still wearable
4.0,"The colors are vibrant and the bars are the perfect length, but unfortunately when I got mine, the green one had scratches on the bar. It wouldn't unscrew either. I tested all the other ones and they seem to work fine. They aren't the highest quality barbells out there, and I am a little worried about the color scratching off, so we'll see how these work out. But for the price, you really can't complain too much. I switch my barbells out fairly often so it is nice to have a variety of colors to choose from."
4.0,Very warm and stylish. Speedy delivery!
4.0,The black bracelet’s colored bead is not purple. It leans on the side of blue. Still beautiful but wouldn’t work for me since I needed a lavender/purple one.
4.0,It's a cute top just wish it was just a tad longer
4.0,"bought for my daughters' formal, she love it."
4.0,"A true test of a wallet is to come back in a year and see if I'm still using it... But so far it is a nice no frills wallet. Hold my cards. Hold my cash. Don't disintegrate. That's really all I'm looking for. If you can look good while doing it, all the better.<br /><br />Initially the card slots were excessively snug but after a week or so loosened up appropriately.<br /><br />Enjoying the purchase, hoping the durability lasts."
4.0,Looked just like the picture.  Gave as a gift.
4.0,Strap is smaller than I'd hoped and doesn't allow the watch to be changed on its cradle quite right so I have to remove the straps every time the watch needs charging.
4.0,Smelled weird and knitting is cheap. You get what you pay for!
4.0,I love my new sweat bans . So many cool colors.
4.0,Earrings are very pretty and dainty. However  they are very tiny. Picture is of earring in a 3.5 x 3.5 box. Suitable for baby or child.
4.0,This is a great looking watch. The world timer is a little hard to see but I am sure it you were traveling then it would help greatly of it you need to know the time in another country for business.<br />I love this watch.
4.0,Waterproof and Fits as advertised.
4.0,I should have ordered a size smaller and then figured out something for my breast because this is a super cute dress that I need to wear but is just a bit to big. I think it would be cute as a fun summer dress with sandals and then of course boots and a Jean jacket for a redneck of a good time!!  Dress is very light weight and you will definitely want to wear undergarments the same color. I wouldn’t call it see through just thin and there are two layers so that for sure helps.
4.0,Love it very beautiful great deal
4.0,"I bought this as a gift for my sister. She was really pleased with it. The chain that comes with it is kinda cheap, but not that big a deal."
4.0,I bought 2 of these dresses. One green and one black/gold. I now understand why everyone's ratings and reviews range so broadly. Though I bought both mediums the green one was too big. Also the quality of the craftsmanship ranged. The green one had its zipper  sewn shut and gapped in odd places. The black/gold was really nice especially at that price. I probably could have went with a small. My size is a 4
4.0,I gave this to my sister as it was too big.  I got a medium 180 pounds should have gotten a small. Material is thick and durable.
4.0,As long as you know that this item runs extremely small it's a great cover up and great price. I normally wear a small at 5'2 and 120lbs and ordered the XL and it was a perfect cotton swim cover.
4.0,"Fits well,  looks good"
4.0,Top is cut smallbottom
4.0,"Comfortable.Next time,I will order a larger size.I do like these,though."
4.0,"I've owned the dark brown version of this belt for a while and I really like it.  I've also been looking to buy it in black for a while, but I never could find it, until now.  The black version seems every bit the same as it does in dark brown.<br /><br />I like that it uses milled leather, because that makes it softer and more pliable.  Sometimes I must wear a hard leather belt, but I don't like them digging into my waist, if I don't need them.  This belt won't do that. The milled pebble finish looks nice, also.<br /><br />I also like that the buckle is understated, but not cheap looking.  The roller is neat, but I'm not sure that it actually helps any.  The only problem I have with this belt in both colors, is that the holes are not great for me, so it's usually too tight or too loose.  I knew this before buying it in black and I'm sure that's not true for everyone.<br /><br />Overall, it's just a nice looking belt that's very comfortable.  I own a lot of belts, and though I never spend much money on belts, these are among my favorites.  Timberland belts, in general, always seem a notch above other department store belts, even though I believe most are made by the same manufacturer."
4.0,Good one for this price
4.0,"Thinner than I expected them to be, but they work great and haven't had any issues with them."
4.0,"For the price, it's a great deal. However, the quality isn't best. If little things like unfinished hems and loose threads bother you, you might want to reconsider. But, considering the affordability, it's an overall great dress."
4.0,I like it but it doesn't cover enough of my stomach.
4.0,"These are truly good quality, smooth<br />material,<br />but a little too tight of a feel<br />(since they are &#34;compression&#34; sleeves.<br />I prefer the most relaxed feel of the less<br />quality sleeves sold here.<br />These fit almost like second skin b/c<br />of the elastic up top."
4.0,"This is a very pretty dress but the fit is a little off. When you first get it and try it on, you may need to do some adjustments, but don't worry nothing major. I ordered the small and I am 5'3 and currently weight around 127lbs. I wear a 34D bra and so this may be one of the issues. Anyway, the front was very big and open so all I had to do was pin the deep v neck in the front so it would actually cover my chest, as it was, it seemed like a vest. After that, I added a nice chunky belt and it was perfect! The dress is 100% Polyester, with a beautiful floral pattern and very feminine trumpet sleeves. The material is very good quality and the fit is great, once you figure out what works best for you. Overall, I am pretty happy with this and look forward to wearing it all summer. I received this item at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review of this product."
4.0,Nice looking; kinda thin
4.0,"Looks great, and does not make me feel as if I am wearing a medical alert."
4.0,Love this polo
4.0,"The idea behind these gloves is pretty decent - it seems like we are always wearing out the fingers of our gloves.  For myself, I'm constantly having to buy new gloves not because they are worn out, but because I've worn a whole in the index finger of my right handed glove.  The left glove is still in good shape, but I need a new pair because the right hand is now unusable.  That's where the Premium Garden Claw Gloves by Votanta come in.<br /><br />Out of the box, you get two sets of gloves: the green-colored, black tipped claw gloves plus a white and blue set of gloves that Votanta includes for free.  Both sets of gloves are nitrile-coated on the fingers and palms of the gloves while the rest of the gloves are stretchy cloth material.  The nitrile coating on the claw gloves is rough while the coating on the free set of gloves is slick.  The claw tips on the green gloves were very sturdily attached and didn't seem like they were in danger of coming off.  The gloves are &#34;one size fits all&#34;, but as is usually the case since I am 6'6&#34; tall, my hands were a little too large for the gloves.  I was able to put both sets on, but they were pretty tight.  That being said, the wrist of the glove stretched far enough on my hand to keep dirt out so it was ok.<br /><br />In use, the claw tipped gloves work VERY well for their intended task - allowing you to easily dig in your garden.  I can dig in a garden or raised flower bed without using a shovel, rake, or digging through the ground with my normal leather gloves.  With the nitrile coating, the gloves are very easy to wash off and would take alot to get stained.  The plastic tips are not super thick, but appear to be thick enough to last through hundreds of uses (unless you are continually dragging them over rocks or stones or something).<br /><br />My only issue is not my Votanta's product, but the idea of these gloves themselves.  Sure they are perfect for digging, but once you are done digging, they are essentially useless for further work.  With the plastic tips, the gloves are absolutely unusable for pulling out weeds, holding onto plants or other objects, or doing the myriad of other work that you do while gardening.  So the inventor of this type of gloves solved one problem, but now you have to bring two sets of gloves out to the garden and switch in between the two while you work.  I've seen a similar set of gloves that only has claws on one hand and that would be much more utilitarian - one hand to dig and one hand to do everything else.<br /><br />Overall I was happy with the product even if I didn't really see the point in them.  The sale price of $14.99 is right about in the middle of a survey of other similar products on Amazon.com (and there are dozens that are identical).  Obviously the added bonus of the free set of normal gloves sets this product apart."
4.0,"It is beautiful, but it is bigger than normal size. I usually use small so I bought small and this dress was bigger. It looks like medium. Overall the dress is very elegant and beautiful."
4.0,It was a little shorter than expected.  Width was great but the length was not what I was expecting. The color was exactly like the picture and the material is good for the summer.
4.0,"This scarf goes with anything!<br />The fabric is soft and doesn't irritate the skin.<br />There were no flaws in the fabric upon receiving, and this scarf has held up nicely."
4.0,"Light, stretchy, comfortable, and exactly what I was looking for. There were a few loose threads, and if you're searching for something warm for the winter, look elsewhere, as this is very thin material."
4.0,"These are fine, but I prefer the high waisted. I like the fit and I think the material is different as well."
4.0,Very pretty but order a little larger.
4.0,Loved the material and look of this dress. Very soft and flattering.
4.0,Was a gift for someone & runs VERY small!!
4.0,This arrived very quickly and was exactly as I expected. This is my second one I also have the red top with navy polka dot bottom. I love them but wish the top provided a bit more coverage for busty gals!
4.0,Not as sparkling as I expected. Easy to take out links. Overall nice band.
4.0,"I have a large head and have tried pretty much every other sunhat for women available on Amazon.  This one works because it's got a velcro closure at the back making it completely adjustable.  While it doesn't look cute on me like the girl in the photo, it does cover and protect my face.  The price is good and the hat seems well-constructed, if not terribly fashion-forward."
4.0,Todo bien hubiera preferido una hebilla plateada
4.0,"This is a nice looking boot and it has the zipper on the inside of the ankle, where it belongs! My problem is that with a somewhat ""high"" instep, I have trouble getting the boot on my foot/feet. The pull-up straps are so small you cannot get a finger through the loop."
4.0,The clips are a little cheap. I had to bind one of the tabs so that it would stay together. Other than that they are grate.
4.0,"It fits very well, love the pockets and the color is as the picture. Length is good, I’m 5’2” and it fits good."
4.0,"Comfortable, very light. Good deal for the price. Recommend"
4.0,Something small
4.0,"La calidad es menor al original, es mal delgado, pero es todo lo que decía en el anuncio."
4.0,Does the job well
4.0,"Cute shoes, not the best quality."
4.0,"Exactly what was looking for, for the emergency dash for valuable papers and things in event of fire, earthquake, or flood"
4.0,Super cute hoodie.  Runs VERY small! Order big.  I had to get a 2xl and I normally wear a large
4.0,"Ran a little small, but otherwise fit well.  Quality was OK."
4.0,"Very cute skirt, good price. However description is not exactly accurate. The skirt flares out from the bottom part a lot more than what is shown in pictures. Length is good not too short, fit is good, buttons stay closed. I am 5'2 and weight 137 lbs and I ordered a M."
4.0,I'm 120 lbs and ordered a size small which fit me really well. I love this dress!
4.0,i do like them but what i like more is other's coming up to me telling me how much they like 'em...
4.0,I loved it for dipping my sterling flatware. I wish the bottle were tall enough that I didn’t need to dip half and then the other half. Otherwise I was very pleased!
4.0,"Its not so great but ok, for me 36'' fit but for safe i ordered 38'' but the length is little short, it should have been little more lengthy, when you guys need 38'' better to order 4-6'' bigger one."
4.0,This item is awesome. Very warm and well made. I want to give it 5 stars but I can't. The fit in the picture is misleading. This jacket does not narrow at the waist as pictured.
4.0,"My daughter wanted a white, lightweight watch with gold (not silver) accents.  This one is perfect and we like ToyWatches.  My only concern is that it did not come with any documentation, no instructions at all."
4.0,But I could shrink a little. Hot water. Hot dryer.  Heavy. But I am always cold so perfect for me!
4.0,A bit bigger than expected.
4.0,"I enjoy changing my band to match outfits. Only reason not five star is the &#34;red&#34; band is more orange and purple band is a dull purple, The band is large for small wrists but the two anchor straps keep it secure. Good quality and value for seven bands."
4.0,I like it n fit me just fine  but I ask for a blue n i got a greyone
4.0,I normally wear a size 12 so ordered a large and the bust was too small. I gave it to my daughter and am going to order another one a size up. I like the fit in general and the material.
4.0,I love it! I like to wear activewear in the summer time - so when you're sweating you're not too hot. Great colors.
4.0,This hat is super cute! It’s very soft and plush. It was quite large on my head though and I had to keep pushing it out of my eyes. It was stretchy like most hats so it felt too big overall. The ears were also more rounded like bear ears and I was going for more wolf like ears given the name. For the right sized head though this would be a great warm hat!
4.0,Cute socks for our daughter and now son in law!
4.0,No me gusto la calidad de la tela
4.0,"Nice item but broke during work, was pretty bummed."
4.0,Cute outfit could do without the shirt tho... a little too big for my twins....
4.0,I love these but just a tad to short so I had to return them.
4.0,"Took some getting used to, but I love em."
4.0,The scrunchie is beautiful. The only issue I had was with the screen part it doesn’t fit. I was to nervous to put too much force to lock it on. But it still looks great without it.
4.0,When I received the item it was really nice. The materials used arent the best. But they a very understanding and when a piece came off they assured me that they would improve materials and gave me a refund. It is a really nice watch. Definitely worth 16 dollars
4.0,"Overall I liked the comfort, fit, and design of these lace tank tops. However, on one of them, part of the lacing came off the shirt. I will have to sew it back on."
4.0,"This dress is beautiful.  I received this product either free or at a discount in exchange for my fair, honest, and unbiased review.  And I am quite pleased with this dress.  It fits me perfectly.  When I first tried it on, I thought it might be too tight- however a quick look in the mirror proved otherwise.  The colors in the dress are vibrant and the pattern is beautiful.  I really like how it is not as fancy as I had originally thought (the skirt is not quite as full), so I can get more use out of it on a regular basis.  I am giving four stars instead of five stars because of the collar- it stinks up in a funny manner, and I am going to have to sew it.  I recommend this dress to anyone looking for a beautiful piece of clothing."
4.0,Very pretty and soft.  Was a bit big in chest area and a bit long for me (I'm 5'2 and usually wear a 12-14). I would suggest to Order a size smaller then size chart if bust not too large.
4.0,Neat shirt! Little to large for me I should of ordered smaller the wholes go right along the breast area so can't wear that colorful of bra but other than that pretty nice shirt great material
4.0,Me agradó es cómodo y práctico para usar
4.0,nice looking blazer. It’s reddish/tan than I was hoping for. I was looking for blk and tan or more towards white like the image. But I will wear it anyway.
4.0,"We ordered this for my daughters frozen themed birthday party. She has already tried it on, loves it and it looks very expensive (though It was not)! I also ordered some blue jelly shoes for the occasion and am pleased with this dress."
4.0,"For the price this watch is great. It is fun, the colors pop. It's easy to use. Not sure about the battery life. It's still going at almost a year."
4.0,Stayed on better than most band with gel strips and super comfy
4.0,Nice quality wallet but kinda bulky once loaded. Overall I'd recommend.
4.0,The only thing is that they are tight if you have thick thighs.
4.0,"The fabric is really nice , but the inside of it is slightly scratchy . I like that it’s not see through like a lot of unlined dresses are , very comfortable , and you can wear it for bed or dress it up during the day."
4.0,"The costume was mostly as expected. It’s made of a soft, fleece material, but the front area is a different story—too scratchy to wear without a shirt underneath. It seems to have silvery, shiny specks of plastic spun into the fabric in that area. I wasn’t expecting that, so I can’t give it 5 stars. It did fit well and was otherwise a great costume."
4.0,These gloves arrived today. Just in time for the cold mornings. They look beautiful.  I was a little skeptical because past reviews said some of the stitching was bad/missing.  They look great.  The touchscreen finger and thumb don't work on my phone.  I thought about returning them because of this but they're pretty so I'll keep them.
4.0,The Trainer didn't run as small as some of the comment seen.. I order a large cause of the run small suggestions so I will just order a medium shortly.. It works good with tightening everything up.. The only problem was it kept riding up I'm not sure if it was from the type of work I do or what.. I would suggest this to others though
4.0,Its okay I just thought it would be better but it is comfortable
4.0,A bit narrow for my head (puts pressure above my ears) but I still wear them occasionally. Great to leave in the car for driving.
4.0,"Really cute style, the black has little white specs all over them because they attract all things dusty.. kinda cheap material.  However they are comfy, and I'm really bummed the burgundy aren't available on Amazon!!"
4.0,I would say the picture is a bit different . Leopard print is slightly faded . Still super cute
4.0,"I love my dress even though it was a little big, but it didn't look too bad I like for my dress to fit but not too tight. This dress here fits just a little bit bigger than I would like."
4.0,"Measured my wrist at 6.5 inches- originally tried small. Small was a bit too loose- watch kept sliding too much and would lock out of Home Screen. Also wasn’t accurately capturing heart rate with Peloton work-out. Picture is the X-Small. X-small works well. Snug enough to not slip around but still very comfortable, not too tight."
4.0,"Decent packaging, and looks like they cared about the product for such a cheap price. Comes with a tool to remove links. Haven’t seen any green tarnishing or wear on the gold color. I’ve had for maybe a week and worn every day so far and it seems like it will wear fairly well."
4.0,"It is a bit of a tight fit but, I still like them. They also rust and corrode easily so you do need to stay on top of cleanliness. They do however have very distinct colors and I like that I could match them with my dyed hair or an outfit and it would pop."
4.0,"These are comfortable to wear, it is the exact color that I did order. Slightly see though, but they work well for my costumes I am using these for and they are a good lenght."
4.0,"Its very pretty, and study. Doesn't spin around on my wrist.<br />Only complaint is it turns my skin green.<br /><br />I have had several compliments on this watch, including that it looks very expensive."
4.0,"Exactly what I was looking for. Your standard fuzzy sock, but not too thin. Very soft and comfy."
4.0,It's a nice stylish sunglasses but my friend's face was too big for it. But over all is a gooo one.
4.0,I would’ve given this a full review five stars but the material was very thin which I expected Fort to be for Costumes for one night. It fit my husband very snug might need to size up.
4.0,"It fit true to size and was the style I was looking for, but personally, I wanted the material to be a bit thicker."
4.0,The minute and hour handles should be in a different color for easy readings.
4.0,Loved these earrings. Length  is as pictured and they are very light weight and easy to wear.
4.0,Its great. I could have been more specific on what I wanted but good.
4.0,"These are super comfortable, fit well and stay up for the most part. They don't have any sheerness when squatting and are ALMOST perfect!<br /><br />CONS: They've already started pilling between the thighs and where I sit."
4.0,I don't believe they are real vuarnets they say Taiwan on them but a good product for a great price.
4.0,"It has a nice feel and weight, it does not feel cheap. It's easy to put on and take off. I like the bling at the end of the tips. Charms go on easily.  The only thing I would change is the tip size. I think it would be easier to screw on and off if it were just a tiny bit bigger."
4.0,"It's very nice, but the sizing is off.  It was too big for my husband."
4.0,Fits small. But knew in advance so up sized before ordering. All good.
4.0,The size was kind small
4.0,Grippy shoes. Nice but although the size seams correct I find them a little bit narrow. Hope they stretch a little bit!
4.0,"Very thick, more for fall lounge wear"
4.0,"If you're new to having a purse, this is a great bag to start with. Its not huge but it's big enough to fit the essentials in. The main opening is a little small, and the zippers came in the middle and you have to figure out which way they open and shut with all of them. But overall I really like it. There's 2 open pockets and a zipper pocket inside they don't show on the description photos, so that was a nice surprise. The smell everyone talks about really isn't that bad. After an hour its pretty much gone. Fabreeze will fix it if it still lingers. Also in the picture it looks like soft fabric, but its not. Its nylon so don't put it in high heat"
4.0,"So many compliments when I wear the earrings. They are bright & pop out! The pearls on the bottom could pop off but they can be plugged in again, so that's something to keep in mind."
4.0,"Overall this shirt is comfortable and cute, but I was sent the wrong size.  The fit was kind of funny.  Very loose and frumpy in the sleeves, but only a little loose in the torso.  I ended up keeping this size, as I was afraid if I replace it with the smaller size it may be too tight.  But I have been very happy with this shirt,as it is very comfortable, and I love to wear it."
4.0,A little tight but over all great fit and length
4.0,Liked it so well I ordered two more for friends.  Looks and ties great. Bright vivid colors and looks like it will wear well without pilling.
4.0,"Wish it was closed in the back ,but I do like it !"
4.0,My husband really liked this wallet but after barely 2 months of use the closure clip broke and it hadn't been 'overstuffed'.
4.0,Please adjust the sizing of simular garments. I and my wife think these items are beautifully made.
4.0,"Nice watch, thought the face would be larger though."
4.0,It is heavier than I've expected. But my son loves lighting.
4.0,Very cute. I got compliments while wearing it. Price is not too bad either.
4.0,They are nice earrings. They are beautiful but the quality may not be all that but it can be worn for special occasions or a nice little dress up dinner type thing.
4.0,Bought as a gift for my brother.  Belt is extremely lightweight because the buckle is not metal. We travel every weekend so I am anxious to see how it will work when going through airport security. Will update soon.
4.0,It's cute but it seems kinda cheap
4.0,I wasn’t sure about this shirt at first because it was very cropped. More than expected. I wore it out and got so many compliments at the bar!
4.0,Not as thick as I thought it would be
4.0,"Very cute design and my 10 year old loves it! It's very short though. Definitely not a nightgown, but more of a pajama shirt. It seems well made, although the fabric is pretty thin, but for hot summer nights, it's perfect!"
4.0,"Purchased 2 bathing suits. One in pink and one in blue.  Both size Medium.  They arrived about 10 days apart, maybe different distributors.  The pink one fit, the blue was too small.  Returned it."
4.0,"I love this scrub top! So cute, fits perfectly and all of my clients get a good laugh! I hope to order the others in the line. I took away one star because they are a little pricey."
4.0,fit nicely and is comfortable
4.0,These earrings are really cute the gummy bears are really light on ears but the lollipops weight is like a star 3 but so far these are really cute and good!
4.0,I like the look and the fit of the glasses.  The lenses are a little too dark.
4.0,This bag is comparable to my more expensive military style bags I've purchased over the years. The plastic fibers that make up the inside pockets feel cheap but I can love with it. That minor draw back compared to all the other amazing features at such a low price point makes this bag worth a buy.
4.0,"This pair of mens shorts are meant for casual wear- Just be sure you realize that- nothing of a zipper/ button walking short!! With sack style cinch waistband, one can get a desired personal fit using the tie over the elastic waistband.. these resemble swimsuit trunks in style just made of different material!<br /><br />We found fit to be standard with US sizing but, bc of their simple style- they are not formfitting. These actually have a bit of a baggier bulk thru the front. These have slit pockets on hips to help make them functional.. along with back pockets for wallet.<br /><br />Material is soft and stitching seems solid. No loose threads and finished with a solid tucked edge. *Note: Knot tie strings on the waist.. otherwise, you may lose it into the abyss which is maddening! Washed on cold and dried on low heat- we had no issue with shrinking or fading. (If fit is ideal prior to wash- I’d recommend line dry to avoid unwanted shrinkage!)<br /><br />Ordered XL and for reference: husband is 6’3”, 210lb, 34x36 waistband- active but not overly athletic 50yr man build. In swim trunk or athletic short we usually order XL as well.<br /><br />Best recommended for those looking for casual dress down shorts to hangout or do outdoor activities- these are not athletic shorts nor, walking shorts.. they are a perfect “in between!” My husbands highlights with these: the ease and comfort in wearing.. no belt needed. Along with standard back pockets for wallet. Hoping this info helps your decision- stay safe everyone!"
4.0,"Very cute and very stylish. Would have given 5 stars but one earring lost a spike and the the other earring, was on so tight on both sides that we had to use pliers to get it loose."
4.0,Wanted a size 5 but has to settle for a 5/6. A little big but my grandchild will grow into it
4.0,As expected for the price. Material is thin.Keep away from cat claws.
4.0,they we're a bit short on me mt mistake I im 5'8 should have went for a longer size other then that they are a comforable  pair of pants
4.0,"Están bonitos, pero en la foto se ven de un tamaño moderado, y cuando llegaron don más grandes de lo que se ven en la foto"
4.0,"For the price, this is great!! This is not meant to keep you warm but more like a colorful accessory.  Color came as expected, the material is soft and it's long enough to style all sorts of ways.  Will definitely be purchasing other colors as well"
4.0,"This item run small, I'm a 34DDD and had to order a xlarge. Fits ok on top but gonna have to make a few adjustments. Besides that, the top is really cute. It lights up as described. I really like it!"
4.0,"We liked the size of the umbrella, as we use it for a family on the beach.  However, it is heavy to carry to the beach.  Also there are plastic parts, which could be lost or broken."
4.0,Fits nicely and great quality! Arm length runs a little short which made me contemplate exchanging for an XL but the body fits great. Very happy with purchase overall.
4.0,"Nice big bold face. You can easily glance at the watch to see the time. The band fits perfectly - not too loose & not too tight. The rose gold color is a nice change from just gold color everything. Packaged well when shipped. Gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because at the beginning, it lost time one time only. Seems to be doing great for the three days we have owned it. For the price, you will be pleasantly surprised at just how nice this watch is. Go ahead and buy it!"
4.0,"This dress is so cute.  It is very cute and comfy.  My qualm is that it gapes in front of the arm pit area.  I ordered a large (I am usually a 12-14) and it fit great everywhere, was cute and not clingy...quite flattering as I have a bit of a gut...its just a little awkward at the top.  I wear a 38D bra and was worried it would be tight in the chest...it isn't, just kind of ill fitting in the boob/underarm area.  I suppose it could be taken in a bit, but I'm not that crafty."
4.0,"Great colors and fabric and draping, but the four back seams bothered me, as I have sensitive skin.  Other women may not mind at all, but I did."
4.0,"They are tight about the head and the anti-fog only lasts till the first cleaning. However, they met my district's eye covering requirement and that is all I care about!"
4.0,Definitely booty shorts. Wouldn't feel comfortable in public without tights or leggings underneath. Still like them though..
4.0,"I have had the worst luck trying to find a decent sized, well-made backpack purse. I found this bag and knew it would be a quality bag. I’ve had a Matt & Nat bag before and loved it. However, it’s so much smaller than I thought.  I’m going to keep it because despite the size, I love it."
4.0,The center of the wig did rise up and became somewhat pointy so had to constantly push it down. The wig appeared too at first small but you have to work with it and it will fit.
4.0,"The comfort of this dress really can't be beat, at least for the most part. That said, I like my clothes loose and flowy, especially when I'm at home. While most of this dress is exactly that, the arms were surprisingly tight, to the point that I couldn't stand to wear it. I hated to let a perfectly comfortable dress go to waste, so I cut off the arms. My intention was to sew it back up, but it looks fine as is (especially considering it's a house dress), and I haven't had any unraveling to happen. Aside from the arms, the only complaint I have is the weird wings at the side. I'm not sure what the purpose of these are. My husband even likes this dress, but he thinks the wings are super odd, too. It's almost like they're supposed to be pockets, but they're not deep enough for that. Overall, though, as a housedress I like it, at least after I removed the arms."
4.0,Fun to stack or wear alone. Great for summer and playing n the pool.. they don't slip off.
4.0,"been looking for just this hat and had ordered from several other places trying to find one only to receive them and they not be what I wanted. This hat is exactly what I was looking for. It fits a bit large, but I possibly could have a smaller than average size head. Just the same it's very well made and very cute."
4.0,"It could have been a little more snug across the top, but all in all it's a solid sandal that does what it's suppose to do."
4.0,So comfortable and soft.  Love it
4.0,Bold and smooth
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:7a30bfd34a068f1981ea60dd04f107b2]] Ordered these pair for purpose of long distance running training. I did a video review before/after.  Good quality. Great price. Very light, comfortable.  I would recommend to light runners but not to extreme training types.  You'll only get 3-4 weeks out of them.  For price you can't go wrong.  I will be purchasing more in the future."
4.0,"Delivery took a week longer than my order for a similar product from another supplier on amazon.com, that arrived in four days. Fabric, fit and finish all OK, at a low price. These and all other men's sleepware are not offered in different sizes according to height. They are all sized for men at least 6ft. tall! I'm 5 ft. 2 now at age 82. I have to cut them off and hem them."
4.0,Loved them but they were too small for my glasses and had to return
4.0,The hip area for an extra large is too tight.
4.0,Feels like jeggings more than sweatpants im 5'3 & 25  inch waist  and  got medium
4.0,"If you're in between sizes, go up. Very cute & great value. Workout or with jeans will look great"
4.0,"I got many compliments on the earrings. They are very light on the ears and don't weigh down the earlobes. One came apart on the first day while wearing them but I was able to put it back together. Luckily I was in the car and the piece fell into my clothing. Otherwise, I would have been pissed."
4.0,Nice coverup. Material is a little stiff and rough
4.0,"These are quite small diamond hoop earrings that just barely dangle further than the ear lobe. They are elegant; diamonds are of decent quality, and you can't beat the beauty to price ratio. The reason for four as opposed to five stars is that the clasp is not very strong, one side in particular was less strong than the other. I'm scared that I might loose one!"
4.0,"Shorts were too small but very cute, love the top, so soft and the top fits perfectly....I ordered a small which is the size I typically am in a top"
4.0,"Easy to program and super cheap as compared to the real thing. Sometimes takes 3-4 presses to work, but I can live with that for the price."
4.0,Love the material. It's very soft. Though I was expecting more of a pullover thickness.<br />It will add a lovely warm layer though without adding too much bulk.<br />It's a little large on the shoulders.
4.0,I like the warm ups would order again!
4.0,"thin material, get what you paid for"
4.0,These are comfortable but could be better. I have high arches and they hurt my feet about the same as any other shoes after bring on my feet a while. Always fears good things about brooks and thought I’d try them and they’re just ok so i guess I’m slightly disappointed.
4.0,I like it but it is a little stinky at first
4.0,A little small. I can only wear them on my pinkie finger.
4.0,Someone forgot to stitch the two sides
4.0,Granddaughter will be thrilled and I was happy with the quality.
4.0,Holds you in.  I thought the one shoulder cut too high across my neck.
4.0,"I didn’t like that the skirt appears to have a lot of ruffles when , when u see the skirt in person it hardly has any ruffle at all"
4.0,"I ordered several pairs of these socks in different styles. These run a size larger than expected.  I take a size 9 to 9.5 in a woman's shoe and 7.5 to 8 in a man's boot. I ordered these in a small / medium size which is rated for up to size 8 in a woman's size and they fit me almost perfectly. I did try a medium / large pair in another style and they were too loose. Even in this small /medium size, the heel can come up above my heel if I pull on the sock too much; nevertheless, they are almost a perfect fit.<br /><br />They offer medium compression around my calves and some compression on the soles of the feet and archs. I like the ""normal sock"" look of these knee-highs. I like the stripes but what I do not like is the washed out pink color that looks very dingy. They wash well in the washer but I lay them flat to dry.<br /><br />They offer 15 to 20 mmHg Compression and are made of 45% cotton, 40% nylon, and 15% spandex. The current price of $19.95 is expensive for a pair of socks but is competitively priced with typical compression socks. I wish this color were a bit better because then it would have gotten 5 stars."
4.0,"I bought this in the cool aqua color. It's a lovely shade and has an almost jersey fabric look. Fabric itself is very smooth, lightweight and slightly stretchy. It's a nice size for using as a shawl and easily folded for use as a scarf. Haven't tried it out yet so I can't review how breathable or sun protective it is."
4.0,This dress is stretchable so one size smaller will work. Its a casual dress so can be worn daily. Body fabric is soft but love those chiffon sleeves that’s make the whole dress beautiful.
4.0,"Hangs on me in a strange way. I love the bottom,  just wish the top looked right. Highly recommend using a dress belt."
4.0,"I got those primarily for my reading glasses so I can hang them around my neck instead of looking for them in various rooms in the house. This concept has worked out well for me. The cord is comfortable and is easy to attach onto the arms of the frame. Unfortunately on day two one of the rubber sliders of the black cord broke for no apparent reason, rendering that cord useless. Fortunately I had four other colors left to choose from. So far the reddish/orange cord is holding up nicely. Overall I am pleased with this purchase."
4.0,"I purchased this for a trip to Antigua just to have a small bag to take to the pool and beach.  It is very cute, pretty durable, but you cannot put heavy items in, it will break.  The knob to close the purse fell off within five days."
4.0,Nice and fit as expected but the material looks cheep.
4.0,Nice blouse I ordered 2 sizes up after reading reviews and looking at the size chart but I think 1 size up would have been sufficient.
4.0,en las caderas es algo pequeno
4.0,Nice looking for an inexpensive bracelet. Can be worn casually or a little more dressy.
4.0,"If you are looking for a versatile dress for traveling that you can pack without worrying about wrinkling and dress up or dress down - this one is perfect. Just note that it is a little see-through. Purchased a M black and hits right below knee although you can pull it up a little :) 5'9"" normal size 6-8."
4.0,These are great! I wear mine all the time. A little one the short side for me. I'm 130 lbs & 5'4&#34;
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:67bfc83f5fd95ef6088720452b591513]] The positives: The cut, styling and length of this apron makes it appropriate for 1800's-early 1900's historical outfits/cosplay. The gathering is ample and gives a very attractive feminine fit - shaped at the waist, blousing out at the hips.  The fabric is soft and comfortable, and the color is even and attractive. The price is outstanding. It has handy pockets at the side seams.  The width of the apron at the waist is very ample - more that 32 inches - and the ties are long enough to tie in back or wrap around front.<br /><br />The negatives: The fabric is a little thin.  Patterned shirts show through the bib, which is only one layer thick.  One side pocket had a hole in it where the fabric fell short of the serging.  The apron is so wide at the waist that I have to overlap it in back and tie the strings in the front, which actually looks quite cute."
4.0,"I have trouble with my feet, so always willing to try something stylish, reasonably priced, and fits well"
4.0,"Was a little tight around my belly, but I liked it nonetheless"
4.0,"The charm, chain, and clasp all seem like decent quality. Even the ringlets on the charm and caps seem better than average (or, at least, there's very little visible gap in them right now). The biggest thing I'm concerned about are the caps at the ends of the chains. There's no way to tell how these are attached to the ends of the chains, and since the chain doesn't have ringlets, if the caps go, the chain will be useless."
4.0,These socks stay put. Worn several times and happy with them so far.
4.0,"GIFT FOR BOYFRIEND, HE SEEMS TO LIKE EM"
4.0,"Beautiful pullover lightweight sweater! The colors are so pretty. I LOVE it! However, the sleeves are a tad short even though I sized up so I gave it four stars (but I keep them pulled up so it looks awesome anyway!)"
4.0,"This suit is is definitely cute and figure flattering. But I did have some dislikes. I ordered a large - I usually wear an 8-10 but this was too big overall. I'm 5'2&#34; and 135 lbs.  I did find the halter ties are a bit too short and uncomfortable.  Also, the material was much thinner then I was expecting. It's a great suit for looks but I'm not sure how well it will hold up in the pool.  There is no tummy control at all, just the ruching that helps hide those areas we all hate."
4.0,Getting lots of compliments when I wear it.  Nice!
4.0,very nice blouse ...material is very soft.
4.0,"The colors are white, gray, silver, and blue. I thought the fourth color was closer to black but it is a true blue. They are very well made and beautiful at a good price"
4.0,Good smartwatch
4.0,"Well made, and fits well. Came looking new with no scratches, and clasps and hinges on all the earrings work properly and seem sturdy."
4.0,Great workout belt
4.0,"I initially ordered an M:34-38 because I have a 36 waist, but that size is far too short.  Putting the belt through the buckle and then the belt around my waist clarifies that there is not enough belt left to reach the velcro patch that secures it.  I successfully tried again with the L:38-42 size because this is a very nice belt otherwise and at about half the price of similar belts.<br /><br />A standard test for gunbelts is to pinch from top to bottom.  This belt passes that test by not collapsing and is certainly stiff enough that I trust this to carry my compact OWB holster without twisting or flipping.  The belt is MIL-W-4088 spec nylon webbing with an AustriAlpin Cobra buckle.  I adjusted the sizing to an ideal fit using the belt's velcro patch.  This sizing adjustment positions the buckle for easy on/off without further adjustment.<br /><br />The belt has a giant loop that sticks out in the front as an odd fashion statement.  I suspect Mauhoso copied this from the various riggers belts that needed this loop to secure oneself into a helicopter or airplane safety line.  The loop has no practical use on an EDC/CCW belt."
4.0,The assembly of this item is rather sloppy with uneven gathers around the wrists and the zipper is smaller than the opening for it resulting in a 3/4 inch open gap at the bottom of the zipper.  The shorts tend to ride up.  The fabric is soft and pretty.  Design is nice but it is not well made.
4.0,Good lasted a few months rip after so many washes
4.0,Really cute. Daughter ordered the wrong color but she is happy with them. They fit well and look sort of Harry Potter like.
4.0,"These leggings are overall very nice, although I did have to return them because they run very small. I usually wear a size 0-2 and xs to small in clothes, but the small was uncomfortable tight If you order a size up, they are really nice although the fabric is a little less shiny than a lot of workout leggings."
4.0,"The color is beautiful & fits as expected. The lace sleeves are super classy. However, it could be looser at the neck. It might get looser over time & with wear."
4.0,"So pretty and silky! I was going to wear it to an outdoor concert, but it was too hot out (and this fabric isn't breathable.) But...I mean, check it out! My husband loved it! *note: it is a bit low cut, but if you don't feel comfortable with it, I'm sure you could pin it up a bit or wear a lacy tank underneath it. The fabric makes it perfect for tossing in your luggage to wear out on the town too; no wrinkles!"
4.0,"The box the shoes came in was beat up messed up, The box Looked used!<br />All tho The shoes looked and fit perfectly."
4.0,LOVE IT! You will need to wear a tank top underneath as it is very thin but it is so comfortable.
4.0,I like it but I kind of expected it to be a little smaller and less stiff.  It's great quality.  Amazing quality...
4.0,"I like this dress! The one thing I’m not crazy about is that it does flare out at the waist but it’s not at an awkward sport which is good, maybe because of the pocket fabric inside. It’s very comfortable and light and will be perfect to teach in in spring. Would also look cute with a jacket of some kind. It hits me literally right before my knee, which is good for teaching.  Material is nice, can’t see through it(yay). Very tropical looking. The pockets are fantastic by the way. Somewhere to put my keys and phone is always a plus!"
4.0,"Love it.  Fitted, but tie in the front allows for some coverage in the lower waist area."
4.0,There are so many colors that match this  even looks great with  jeans  I am 5”3  120 lbs  I got a small
4.0,"My daughter loved this! It fit great, and looked perfect with her outfit, but there was one problem. As this is a cast piece, it can be a bit fragile. Somewhere in the day, or two before wearing to the event it was purchased for, the tail broke off! I am not sure of the cause, because both my wife, and daughter both had it in their possession at different times, but we used super-glue, and some string, as a reinforcement, to hold it together. Had no issues until it was time to remove it, but by then, we weren't concerned. We may have gotten a bad casting, or maybe its a poor design, either way, my daughter loved it. And I purchased another one! Just couldn't give it 5 stars because of the breakage, but didn't want to go lower, as it could have been entirely the fault of my wife, or daughter. Neither owned up to it, but....."
4.0,Shirt arrived on time. Fits as expected although the material is a bit thin
4.0,"This bathing suit is definitely on the small side -- not too small to bother sending it back; I just hope it doesn't shrink, because the way it's designed, it's tricky to get on when it's a bit small!  I do like it a lot, I just recommend ordering a size up!  I haven't had a chance to wear it enough to say how it will hold up yet, but it's a good-looking suit and comfortable once on."
4.0,"Great for the price, and super cute, but need smaller sizes :( I’m normally a medium and the small is wayyyy too big on me"
4.0,These were a nice addition to earrings I was making. The only part I didn’t like was that the wings can be a little easy to rip where the hole is to attach a hook. The wings of two pairs were also folded which made them hard to straighten out
4.0,"I would have to agree with the previous reading in regards to this product being more of a shoe shaper. It's not wide enough to stretch an average shoe. It's still a great, solid product!"
4.0,"These antlers are super cute and good quality.  However, they were a lot bigger than the average antler headband but definitely fun to wear."
4.0,Nice gloves not good for work
4.0,Really warm and soft lovely for the fall
4.0,"The replacement band is great for the money. It fits my watch great and looks good. It fells good on my wrist as it is very light and comfortable.<br /><br />I would have given it 5 stars, but it did not come with the pin tool, but I was able to use a jeweler's flat head screwdriver to manipulate the pins. I also don't recall decent instructions for the &#34;custom&#34; fitting. It looks like it has adjustable links, but you actually have to cut the band to shorten the length. I just cut near the next available link hole. There is also a fine tuning adjustment on the clasp in case you are kind of in between links. The fine tuning adjustment that has 3 holes on the side opposite the fold over lock.<br /><br />***MAKE DOUBLY SURE BEFORE YOU CUT A LINK OFF SINCE YOU CANNOT PUT IT BACK ON ONCE YOU CUT IT OFF...I RECOMMEND TRYING THE FINE TUNING ADJUSTMENT FIRST!"
4.0,"This looks like it is quality material and the style is really cute. This can be worn with a collared button down for a preppy look, can be worn open as a cardigan or with jeans like the model is wearing. The color options are lovely too.<br /><br />Just be aware that this is slightly loose fitting."
4.0,"The color and quality is nice, I just wish the beads was larger. This is for my teen grandson."
4.0,"I really wanted to keep this bag as the overall structure and quality was nice. However, the color was not a true black - it was a darker brownish black. Not a bad color, but not what I was looking for. I ended up returning."
4.0,Doesn’t fit like I thought it would.
4.0,It’s really good I love it but it’s just that the quality wasn’t as good as I expected it to be and it’s smaller than I expected it to be but I still love it
4.0,As cute as expected
4.0,I ordered medium 6/8 because asia size runs small. But it actually fits really baggy. Order your true size. also ordered gray and purple.  The purple is a deep purple almost maroon. It is not a pastel color like the picture.  I like the style and keeping it for the style but disappointed with the color of purple.
4.0,Great product need a tougher clip 1 broke 1st day other has lasted the entire summer
4.0,It's a good buy but my students had a hard time seeing the pattern of trolls and didn't really know what they were at first.
4.0,"I am 5' 3"" 120lbs.  The Small fit just right.  A little stretch tot he fabric but not too clingy.  Not very long but ok for my use.  The black color seems like it might fade with a couple of washes."
4.0,"I ordered the orange yellow version of the swimsuit – unfortunately I received the wrong color. I ended up getting the black and blue version in the mail. I couldn't wear it for what I intended to wear it for because we were having a bachelorette weekend where everyone was wearing specific colors for photos but the swimsuit itself is cute. The quality of the swimsuit seems to be nice. It is definitely padded on the top. This is a major push up bra – Victoria's Secret style – so if you're looking for something slightly padded I would not order this. There is at least an inch of padding in the swimsuit top. I like that the bottoms do come with tags and hygienic liner because I'm always concerned about whether somebody has ordered something and returned it.<br /><br />All in all the product itself is really fine. The swimsuit is cute, I'm just disappointed that I received the wrong color – and after waiting three weeks for it to arrive in the mail that's even more disappointing, I didn't have time to exchange it for the correct one before I left on the bachelorette weekend, but the seller did reimburse me.<br /><br />Review by P. Thomas- I received this product for a discount. This is my honest opinion of the item and is not influenced by any discount. I do not give 5 star reviews just because I received a discount- you can look on my reviewer page to see I give a wide range of 1-5  star reviews.  I am NOT paid to leave reviews. Thank you!"
4.0,This skirt runs super small. Lots of material to fill out the skirt.
4.0,"Nicely made dress, but just too small versus the size chart.  Had to return as it wasn't even close to fitting right."
4.0,Good quality but not too happy about the very short chain
4.0,"I love the dress, just wish it was a little shorter. It has pockets,  which is awesome."
4.0,Exactly what I expected and quick shipping.
4.0,Everyday wear live in Florida
4.0,Such a cute & comfortable dress! Love the cut. It's also great the straps are adjustable. Oh and best part - seamless pockets on the sides :) Excited to wear this.
4.0,"Excellent reading glasses. Only wish the arms were bendable up and down to adjust to my head more precisely. Even so, I tried to buy another pair but the Amazon page said they were unavailable."
4.0,"This beanie is pretty great for being under 20 bucks . The sound quality is good . In a quiet environment, others will be able to hear the base if turned up a bit too loud. Battery life is about 7 hours .<br />My only complaint is the flashing LED light that stays blinking when paired . I wish it turned off at least when paired. I simply covered it with layers of stickers/tape to hide it."
4.0,seems to work fine-purchased it because of face guard too
4.0,Did the job but verrrrry see through. Wear something under for sure!
4.0,"I got this set for my 11-year-old daughter, because she appreciates unusual, creative jewelry. After seeing her wear them for a few weeks, I can offer some feedback...<br /><br />PACKAGING<br />I'm happy to report that this set uses relatively little packaging -- something I want to cover in all my Amazon reviews. The bracelets arrive in a simple, padded paper envelope. The bracelets themselves were in a single small plastic bag, rather than individual bags. The only minor issue with this is that the bracelets were a bit tangled up when they arrived, and it took me about 5 minutes to get them separated. But that's an inconvenience I'm happy to have for the environmental benefit of less packaging!<br /><br />QUALITY AND APPEARANCE<br />The bracelets are all very cute, each one with a seashell, different colored string, and metal beads tying them off at the ends. My daughter liked them immediately, and she has been wearing them to school almost every day for a couple of weeks. There's enough variety in the pack for a different look each day. The stringing seems to be done well, and so far nothing has come apart or broken. I don't think these would withstand a lot of pulling, but it seems to me that they are made well enough to last for a while.<br /><br />ADJUSTABILITY<br />It's a bit tricky at first to adjust the size, as it's not quite obvious which part to pull, and they are pretty tight. It's also a little challenging to adjust the size by pulling on two parts the same amount. But once my daughter figured this out, it's been fine -- just a tiny inconvenience.<br /><br />CONCLUSION<br />For the price, this is a nice set for a kid. The bracelets are made nicely and offer fun, colorful variety."
4.0,"It is a cute shirt, but the material isn't very stretchy. I suggest going a size up."
4.0,They are nice and fit nice but kind of expensive for sweats.
4.0,"This is a great corset, I wear it all the time and it makes several of my outfits really look amazing on me. My only complaint is that the sizing is off. I ordered the 28 inch but its actually 30 inches around when fully tightened, which I did not discover right away as I could not tighten it all the way at first. I've been losing weight and am now able to tighten the lacings as far as they can be and it only goes down to 30 inches, not 28. I love the corset, but am a bit disappointed in the mismarked size, especially as I am now small enough I could stand to have that extra 2 inches to tighten down to."
4.0,It's bright orange like traffic cones. Pic makes it look like a muted orange.
4.0,"I liked the design and material, however, it didn't fit to my Citizen Eco Drive AT 8020 blue angels, so I was unable to use it."
4.0,The only negative thing is that it's hard to get the zipper lined up as the length of the coat has you in a bent over position to get it lined up. Once you finally get it zipped it's  very comfortable and warm.
4.0,"The material is soft, fits loose and washes well."
4.0,Looks Great keeps me warm!
4.0,Very nice piece for the $.
4.0,"Overall, it is a nice top. My only issue is that I found it to run small. I normally wear an XL so I ordered an XL. It was very tight across my chest and a bit tight on the arms. I will exchange it for an XXL."
4.0,Product as advertised.  Nice case.
4.0,"I purchased this dress for our Hawaii trip. I loved that it needed no ironing & fitted well. The fabric was cool to the skin. This dress looked great after several washes but I just hang it to dry instead of using the dryer which I think will shorten the lifespan of this dress. Hey, for $23 I was pretty happy with this purchase."
4.0,"I love how quaint it is, but I’m worried there’s a tiny bit of chipping that may, over time, become something worse. Still, I give 4 stars for first impressions 👌🏾"
4.0,I got these for my 8 year old daughter and she loves them. They have a secure clasping feature and are petite and dainty.
4.0,"Nice necklace , sturdy chain"
4.0,Great design and look. I get a lot compliments. All this needs is an extra pair of stems to come with it. You will have to be super creative to replace the stems if you loose them. Tip: whittle and color a toothpick.
4.0,Purchased was for my son and he loved them :)
4.0,Love the dress! It's somewhat small for a medium or maybe it's supposed to be tight fitting. It's super cute and I love the jet pack on the back!!
4.0,"Super cute shirt. The material is even better than it appears in the picture. However, the picture makes the shirt look longer than it actually is. In the front, the shirt is a little too short for my taste. Given, it is a crop top, so if you're looking for a super cute, short crop top, that looks somewhat classy, I recommend this purchase!"
4.0,This top is so soft and warm.  Love the print and the color.  Could be a little roomier at the chest zone.  I'm not a super busty gal (C cup) and I feel the fit is a little tight in the chest.  Fits well everywhere else.
4.0,"Super cute! Comes with some accessories (but no tights / stockings) and the fabric is soft. Make sure to iron before wearing because of all the creases from shipment. Considering that this came from overseas, it didn't take very long to arrive. I'm satisfied!"
4.0,Everything I own is 2x. This was way too small and couldn't even zip. It's a nice vest with ok material.  Too bad it didn't fit
4.0,"I love basically everything about this band. Extremely comfortable and easy to adjust. The band ends up loosening slightly throughout the day, but tightening it again is effortless, so it doesn't bother me.<br /><br />My only complaint is that one of the loops at the edge near the clasp has snagged on fabric two or three times in the several weeks I have had it and I haven't been able to find the exact cause."
4.0,My head is to small.
4.0,I bought this for myself. I put it on and never take it off. No problems so far. Been wearing since Christmas.
4.0,The bib is very generous and covers the front wonderfully.
4.0,"I sized up and it fit perfect but the notions are darker in color, not as vibrant, and the cups inside the tops are small for the size. Other than that good quality and cute"
4.0,"I absolutely love this romper...once I sent it back for a size up but they sent the second one in like 3 days and it fits perfectly.  The material is awesome, doesn't have that cheap thin feel to it and its comfortable."
4.0,"These pants fit perfect. They are soft and smooth. Had a pouch for cell phone, iPod"
4.0,Love the design but the fabric is so hot... if that's what you're looking for awesome. These are the warmest pajama pants ever but I live in LA so they're a bit too hot for most of the year.
4.0,"Great fit, but this is a heavier material sock."
4.0,"Got them for hiking and they are good for that, except that they are a bit heavy. Other then that, there's lots of storage space and they have a very loose, comfortable fit. Just happened to wear them today to hike in Red Rock Canyon."
4.0,I really like the quality of this bag but the plastic is so stiff that it is a bit of a struggle to get things in. I use 4 days a week for my lunch.
4.0,Very stylish and durable.
4.0,So far the shoes fit as expected and are comfortable
4.0,Nice shirt. Very comfortable. Looks nice. Feels great.
4.0,Love this! They’re so flattering and comfortable. Would wait a while to order them since because of covid mine took forever to get here because of customs!
4.0,Good shirt to wear around the house.
4.0,"I love both pieces. Excellent fit. If you are a little large in the waist and arms are not tone, you might not won't to purchase.<br /> Extremely body conscious."
4.0,The shorts are super comfortable. I ordered a small and they fit my waist perfectly. My measurements for my hips are 35” and my waist is 27”. The only concerning factor is they are baggy right below the zipper area. So when you walk you have to readjust them so they don’t look baggy in the crotch. (Picture with yellow top shoes the baggy area) Because these are super comfy I will not be returning them but definitely something to look out for.
4.0,"Great product. Got it in decent time, especially considering it came from China. Fits all my cards and some cash, and looks to be nicely stitched."
4.0,"It is rather small for my face and does not help with condensation on glasses, but overall, ok. I will be giving to my family and friends."
4.0,Shirt fits larger than expected.  I ordered a small and it fits like a medium shirt usually does. The shirt is comfortable and looks great! I have had many compliments on this shirt
4.0,Bought these for my 11 year old for boy scout camping weekends and I am pleased with them for the price. They kept his feet clean and dry in the woods and he says they are comfortable.
4.0,It was GREAT for our rugby browny costumes.
4.0,"Soft material, pretty colors, looks like phote"
4.0,"I love the color and the pockets. It's a very light (thin fabric) dress, which is nice for summer. Waist band feels a little tight and is not super flattering."
4.0,"I like the belts but they fit a bit smaller than advertised. For the price, they get the job done. I purchased these along with another pack of different colors with silver buckles. I have worn the belts several times and the color doesn't seem to be fading or cracking."
4.0,This dress fit as they sized. I would like this dress at a little longer length.
4.0,"I just received them, and they are a little bit bigger then the picture. But overall they are really pretty, and shipping took about 15 days."
4.0,Great product n good fit. Will buy again
4.0,"I ordered a size larger . But it was way to small for her . Ended up giving it away , and just buying something from the store for her birthday ."
4.0,The sweater itself is a good quality but the graphics appear to be ironed on so I'm not sure how long or how many washes they will last through.
4.0,Fits well & the material is soft and relaxed!
4.0,"Bought this for my nephew. It is ADORABLE and good quality for the price. However, it had a really strong vinyl/chemical smell when it came out of the package. I had to let it air out for days before sending it as a gift."
4.0,Should have ordered a size up other than that a great quality of dress for the price.
4.0,Works good. Pin is loose
4.0,"Cute and colorful. Grand daughter,age 7, loves it. Her field hockey team mates were jealous.Great birthday gift and great price. Only complaint is the backlight isn't too bright to make the the numbers clearer. She doesn't really care though since it,s acolor statement on her wrist and it matches the color of her hockey stick."
4.0,I can still wear the shirt. I just like more extra room.
4.0,"It is a bit big on me, but I'm fine with that because I love baggy sweaters and such. It is a nice quality and the colors are perfect! It is longer than the picture, I'm 5'10 and it goes down a little bit past my knees. My only issue is it took so long to get here, but I was in no rush, so I was fine waiting."
4.0,A the top is a little loose but my waist is bigger than bust. I still love it just wish fabric was thicker
4.0,"Nicely made, just couldn't get the shirt to fit properly. I did order a few sizes. I kept the last and largest size, which is too big but it worked well after surgery. Graphic is true to the picture."
4.0,works perfectly with my dress
4.0,"I ordered these in black and dusk in size medium. I opened the black package first and they don't have much stretch. I opened the dusk package and they are noticeably more stretchy. I read reviews about them being tight around the thigh area and that is true. I do tend to carry more weight in my thighs (as confirmed by my grandmother, thanks grandma) so I thought about going with size large. I tried them on over some spandex bike shorts and the black ones are definitely more tight. I am 5'2 and 135 pounds. Also, for reference, I wasn't sure what size to order because I recently gained some weight and also normally wear thongs and those fit differently. I usually buy size small in thongs and medium in underwear with more coverage but sizing can vary so much with different brands. I decided to go with medium hoping they wouldn't be too snug. I would probably size up but I know I will be losing some weight soon so I am going to stick with the size I got for dusk and will probably size up for the black ones. I also ordered the briefs and the medium size is way more stretchy and will definitely be too big if I lose any weight... unless you like a loose fit. Long story short, if you have bigger thighs, maybe avoid the black color or definitely size up on these."
4.0,We bought these for my daughter’s school musical and they were adorable. We got lots of questions about where we got them. She still wants to wear them everywhere.
4.0,Good shades.  The dimensions are not quite those of raybans.
4.0,I thought they would be thicker.  However they are  good and warm sock
4.0,Pretty. Good price
4.0,Great swimsuit for the price.
4.0,It is a pretty dress but didn’t work for what I needed.
4.0,Great fun; great 'filler' for stockings and gift piles.  Product is new enough to catch interest and offer immediate fun.  It is inexpensive enough to allow for kids to get tired of it without guilt.
4.0,the girl power text is just a biiiitttt smaller than expected but overall i love the shirt
4.0,"I ordered this for my 8 year old daughter. She normally wears a size 8/10 or 10/12 so I got a small. It fits great. She loves it. Only complaint is that after only 1 wash, the color has faded a bit. Not terribly, but I can notice it. Removed 1 star because of that."
4.0,Fits and the kid loves the robots
4.0,Perfect for a Christmas present for my sister in law. Feels soft and looks awesome.
4.0,"I love this bracelet, but I lost it! The only reason I lost it is because of the band closure. The two holes slide over these brassy studs. Well, this is good for the first few times, but after a while, the holes can get loose. I've only worn this bracelet about four times. By the fifth, it was gone. And it's so comfortable, I didn't even feel it come off! I was so hurt because it is one of my favorites. Oh well, someone in Costco has a nice leather cuff bracelet from yours truly!"
4.0,"Great bracelet, good clasp. Good price. Good weight for the price. The only minus for me- the size of the circles is little too big to look real, but I guess it’s my fault for. Or realizing the size before buying it."
4.0,It is great just I did not like the quality<br />But overall was perfect and kids loved it
4.0,"Love these, so comfortable. I chose to take the padding out but they still fit perfectly. Only thing I would change is making the straps a bit thicker. Definitely will purchase more"
4.0,"I got this dress in black and was blown away by how nice it was. The fabric feel nice and it very light and flowy just as I wanted.  I got a size 6 Im 5,1 and 115 pounds so its way too long for me and the top is slightly big. However its nothing I cant fix myself. I highly recommend this dress to anyone. I cant wait to where it for a bridesmaid dress."
4.0,"Did not come in color shown, it works fine, you can fit lots of stuff."
4.0,"This dress looked good on me, and I am pretty picky about how things fit. There was a bit of a weird sow on the top but I was able to work around it. Over all for this price it was nice. Honestly, my only complaint is that the print just didnt look as nice as it does on the picture."
4.0,"I love this sweater! It fits great, the length is just what I was wanting. The only reason I didn’t give it a 5 star is because it doesn’t look exactly the way it does in the photo. Although it was different looking I still liked it and found the quality to be pretty good."
4.0,"I had to have a seamstress make several adjustments, but I got a lot of compliments. I loved the color. I was als disappointed the stones were not purple like on the picture."
4.0,"Dress is beautiful however the construction isn't that good..The fabric is nice, color is perfect have not pressed the dress but over all I'm pleased with my purchase. I have 2  more in this style being delivered tomorrow an Saturday . I just hope it fits. Love Amazon"
4.0,"This mask is as Good, if not Better than Masks being Sold in stores at a Much greater cost. A++"
4.0,My face was too big for the size of the sunglasses. So I gave them to my sister. She really likes it and I think they look good on her!
4.0,"I purchased this to use when I travel for my job, to reduce the bulk that I have to carry through airports and at my job site. It holds  my credit cards, cash, change, driver's license and is not bulky. I have a Galaxy S6 phone, which fit into the outside opening, but I was unable to get the magnetic closures to meet, so the phone was not secure. I was very disappointed,  because previous reviews indicated that the phone should fit. HOWEVER, with a lot of maneuvering, I was able to wiggle the magnetic strip up between the lining and  the outer leather on the wallet side, and though it is a very tight squeeze, I can fit my phone inside and secure it. The zipper on this wallet was difficult to slide when new, but it works better now. I would purchase again."
4.0,It is beautiful but it just didn’t fit me
4.0,I love Carters
4.0,I little higher on the waist than I like.
4.0,The hat was super cute and arrived as expected... was just too small for my giant head.
4.0,"And I love the color. They call it ginger, and it is gorgeous. It seems to run small, however. I couldn't shimmy my behind in it. So, I am going to hold on to it until I can. I love the look."
4.0,"Beautiful suit, I loved the look of it & it was great quality.  However, I ordered an XL and I usually fit M/L.  I'm slightly bigger chested & I assumed it would fit small so I ordered bigger suit hoping it would remedy this problem.  From the picture, I look like I could be the same chest size.  The bodice/ breast did not cover me at all on the top.  I ended up taking the cups out of the suit & snipped the elastic of bra on the side, and allowed it to ride up.  I pulled the suite way up so the middle starts to part open, was actually between my breasts, not my belly button.  HA.  I received a lot of compliments on it.  I ordered black crochet lace shorts to wear with it on the beach.  *  Also, this suite is not white . . .it's cream/ light pale yellow."
4.0,"It is cute, but it is thin."
4.0,Waist too big but fixes nice
4.0,Fits big. Material is very sheer.
4.0,"The sweat gets inside and makes the screen fog. Then when you get rained on, the water gets in, and somehow screws with the time so you have to reset it all the time. Then it stops working."
4.0,"This set of women's reading eyeglasses comes in a 5-pack of glasses with a variety of frame and lens colors with a similar frams shape. Each eyeglass has a fashionable design and pattern and is lightweight for wearing for a long time. The lens has a good quality and is clear with no major scratches. The frames have spring hinges which makes them stretchable and suitable for wider kinds of face types. However, I noticed that some of the screws of the frames are not very tight and need to be tightened and fixed. I also liked the idea in the Sun Readers style which helps a lot for reading under sunscreen.<br />Overall, the frames and lens of this set of reading glasses with their cat-eye design have good quality and the glasses are lightweight for wearing for longer times."
4.0,"Looking good, it is a 4 star"
4.0,"Love this top! Fit perfect in all the right places! Love that the zipper actually works, so you can show more or less as wanted!<br /> It does absorb rain quickly, and takes a while to dry. So I wouldn't recommend wearing it with rain in the forecast haha."
4.0,I love the way it hang on my wrist looking like I have on 2 bracelets on. Very pretty. I don’t like that that it hard to put on
4.0,The length is a bit longer than I expected but because they feel really good on and appear to be constructed so well I will keep them and figure out what Capri length i really want
4.0,It was not the color from the picture.
4.0,"Hat was too large for my head. Tried adjusting to make it fit my head, but the brim was to wide also.<br />Nice hat just not for me."
4.0,Really cute dress but did fit properly.
4.0,Wish a tad bigger and would love pockets
4.0,"I bought this watch a few weeks ago for my brother, and he has raved about it. He said that the wristband holds the watch in place comfortably, and the red face is just sexy. My dad loves it too so he might be getting one for his birthday!"
4.0,I gave these to my sister because they were way too big but they were extremely cute and comfort but too big for me
4.0,Smaller than the size provided.
4.0,Great for the price. It's elastic around the mat so it fits everything but I'm also afraid it might loose elasticity and wear out.<br /><br />Great for a cheap strap! A little on the shorter side if you're thinking about throwing it over your head but still possible.
4.0,"Cute, lenses solid, but wire frame a bit flimsy.  Iffy on spending the money for costume glasses."
4.0,I got this for my husband and while he told me he liked it he doesnt wear it much.  It looks good though.  Nice think material
4.0,great quality and good fit
4.0,I love the fit.  I would have given it 5 stars if the material had been a bit thicker.  I wanted to wear this in the winter.
4.0,"Nice, good materials but it is 2-3 inches short. Looks like mini dress"
4.0,"Nice blazer and especially for the money.  Good value.  6’3, 235: 46L"
4.0,"This is a pretty dress, it doesn't have any sort of lining tho, and the top half sits a little off, but overall pretty good for the price"
4.0,Daughter loved the simplicity and it was off the shoulder. We added a petticoat because it is pretty plain and flat without it.
4.0,"Good bag !!! Not great, not bad !!!  The material looks good quality. It helps to get organized. I like the hanger a lot. The things that could improve: 1) The bag was smaller that expected. Probably best to use with Travel size bottles. 2) It would be nice to have more colors options."
4.0,"The backs are plastic nobs so if that bothers you too, its a bit annoying.  But the studs themselves are exactly as expected"
4.0,I ordered it too small and gave it to my wife.
4.0,"They run kinda small i usually wear size 11 and i got the largest size possible. It fit with a little bit of room leftover. If i got the size suggested it would have been way too small. They are machine washable, I air dried it and I probably wouldn't use a dryer. Overall i am pleased."
4.0,Just a tad bigger than I thought
4.0,Very nice and easy to operate.
4.0,"I like this mask, but hospital will not allow it to be worn inside because of the vent.  I didn't mention the filter but I will tomorrow."
4.0,"I use these as sleep pants when camping. They’re very cute, comfortable, and regulate temperature well, but they do not stay up if you walk around in them like pants.<br /><br />They’d probably be fine as a base layer, I just find myself holding them up while I make coffee."
4.0,Fit as expected. Very cute leotard.
4.0,"I got these joggers since I work as a Massage Therapist and prefer to work in comfortable wear. I prefer them to be lighter and breathable material. They're great joggers however I prefer them to be a bit lighter and breathable since I tend to run hot myself. They seem to be good quality though I will happily update this review if it deteriorates quickly. I've purchased others that appeared to be good quality and within months I saw holes and seams were falling apart. Can't say I'm impressed with them but for the price I paid they're decent. I will have to see how they breathe when I'm at the gym, since it'll be a different story once I'm sweating."
4.0,Beautiful purse. Very functional.
4.0,"soft, comfortable and kept my hands warm. very satisfied"
4.0,"Such a cute outfit. Good quality. Only thing is, there was glitter everywhere."
4.0,"I'd read some reviews which said to size up in this dress; I needn't have. There is plenty of room in the bust area, and because I DID size up, there's a bit of gapping at the underarm. I think it would have fit better if I'd ordered true to my size. But it's still very wearable.<br /><br />It's cool and airy. The fabric feel is much more that of cotton than linen - a bit stiffer than expected, even after washing. Because of this , the lower part sort of hangs straighter out to the sides - isn't as drapey against one's hips and legs as I'd imagined. Perhaps this will soften up after additional washings.<br /><br />The (green) color is as pictured.<br /><br />Another reviewer wrote that they thought the fabric was kind of see-through - I didn't find that to be the case."
4.0,This was bought as a gift.  No information to share
4.0,very soft bag; lots of room... almost too much room.. lol; I pack it til it's too heavy for me!  Has lots of pockets and zipper compartments; nice color blue; goes with pretty much anything
4.0,Great suit for a great value! I am 5' 7&#34; and 165lbs with D cups. This is a fun sexy suit. Only reason I give 4 instead of 5 is because the top doesn't exactly stay in place. The beast pieces have no support - just thin layer and with that deep V neck it's a little risky. Don't do activities in this but it'll be great for laying out at the pool.
4.0,These are really nice sun glasses. They fit well without being overly tight. My husband really liked them before he tried on the pair from another brand I bought for myself. These were a tad bit smaller than the ones I bought and after he tried those on he felt like These were too small. They are well made and came with a pouch to store them and a cleaning cloth. Great glasses we just tend to lean towards larger sun glasses.
4.0,"I like this pj set. Material is nice and soft, but a little heavy. I wish the shorts were a couple of inches longer, but I may get a second pair in a different color."
4.0,"Beautiful material, monarch butterflies.  A little loose on top so low cut.  I have a Lacey shirt/bra that I can wear underneath that makes it fit perfectly."
4.0,I love this dress. I'm wearing this to work on my birthday
4.0,"I love these gloves! I wear them for driving all the time.<br />They are great for keeping your hands warm in cold weather, and protecting your hands from a hot wheel during the summer! The fit is comfortably snug, and the leather is quality. I will definitely be back eventually for my next pair."
4.0,"Nice material, not see through. However it is wide! I'd recommend ordering one size smaller. I kept it because I opened the dress after the return period :( I am using a pretty belt as an alternative to make the dress shape look pretty.."
4.0,"Fits well, works well, highly recommended. So nice I save for special occasions. Only 4 stars because the glasses are great, but would like other designs and plain colored. That is why i haven't bought more."
4.0,"I like it, seems like a good product but the cristals are very tiny... like 1/4 size of a l rice grain."
4.0,The item fit pretty good on my husband but I do recommend go one size bigger if you like a loose fit. Why did I return this item because the hood was purple. What the picture showed it looks like it was Navy blue color.
4.0,"I really wanted to like this dress, but it wasn’t flattering on me in the waistline and there was too much material on the top for me.  I still can’t figure out which side is the front of the dress, tag is on the leg.  The material is really nice and gives alittle but the bow is not like the photos as it is not a stiff material, the bow is the same material as the dress, light weight. So who knows how they got that perfect bow in the photos.  I’m 5’3 160# and got a large but will be returning. If your skinny with no curves you’ll probably like it."
4.0,"These leggings have a nice soft feel.  When looking at them before putting them on, they don't look that great, like they would be loose. But, when I put them on, they fit just right (I am a 4 or 6 usually).  And, they feel comfy.  I will probably purchase again in a different color."
4.0,love them but too short for me
4.0,I really like the material and the vibrant color of this set. I was a little disappointed in the scarf. It is not very wide in fact quite narrow; and it is a little too short to wrap around your neck and tie.
4.0,Love the shirt and how it feels but it fits bigger than expected. Fits more like a medium than a small. But I will still wear it
4.0,"I bought this for my 3 year old who wears size 3T. I was concerned when I opened the package because as my picture shows, the removable tag says size 2-3 years and the sewn-in tag says 4-5 years. Luckily, this fit her well, so I’d say it’s a pretty true 3T."
4.0,This is a really nice and simple dress. I love anything recycled so it’s nice to be kind to the planet and purchase this brand. I washed the dress before use and it held up well. It came out just as soft with no issues. I’m really short so it’s nice that this dress fell right at my feet without dragging. My only complaint is that it runs a little on the larger side so you really should size down or it won’t be flattering.
4.0,They look goodd
4.0,"for the price, it's a great kids shoe that you can beat up and not feel bad about."
4.0,"Great color, perfect fit."
4.0,The watch was nice but the catch on the watch will not hold what is a nice watch I wish it was in a leather band thank you for allowing me to give you my comment
4.0,I really like this band. It comfortable. the magnet is really strong and stays put. The only downside is if you have hairy arms it snags/pull my hair sometimes.
4.0,This is a very practical jacket that my husband will use. It's not the most stylish but it is very functional and does what it's made to do.
4.0,"ok, not that bad"
4.0,It took longer than expected to ship. A little big but very cute..
4.0,"Not very slouchy like the ones I see others wear, but I love it"
4.0,Love the way this fits and looks. I ordered a size bigger and it's perfect
4.0,"Looks just like Kendra Scott without the hefty price tag. My only complaint is I wish they came with a backing. You need a backing, they will fall out (learned from experience)!!"
4.0,Para abrigo bajo la ropa
4.0,"It's exactly what you expect, except that it's small on my wrist."
4.0,Great fit and comfortable except the logo is so heavy and plastic-y that it ends up sticking to you after sweating at all.
4.0,Great bargain.....
4.0,Wasn't able to adjust the links to make it smaller. Love the look of the band.
4.0,The dress was ok..just fit too big
4.0,Like the ring. But the lettering is small
4.0,fit great will order again.
4.0,"This glasses are pretty good the only problem I had was that they were just a lad small . They just barely reached the ears, besides that they are great and use them often."
4.0,"So far so good. I received two sets of three socks, not six individual ones pictured (i.e. three unique designs, not six). Could be random luck.Medium weight material. Good value for price point."
4.0,"Product is fine but size is a little bit smaller than expected, not only long but also width. If you wear 7.5 like me then you should buy a 8."
4.0,Very cute hats.  Fits my 8 month old granddaughter great.
4.0,I purchased it for my daughter. It fit true to size and looks like the photo. I'd buy again.
4.0,"I bought it for my wife because she wanted it and provided the information for it.  Looks kind of cheap, but if that's what she wants..."
4.0,Nice material but a little too snug.
4.0,"For the price, it's very nice.  It's adjustable and comes with matching earrings.  I bought the ivory since I had just read an article that chunky light colored jewelry flatters pale complexions .  So we shall see if I get any compliments when I wear it this Saturday!"
4.0,"Love the Barco One fit and contour. It has the perfect amount of stretch! The material is easy to layer with your fav under scrub AND vest.  No clinging or bunching. In the summer it’s light-weight, quick drying & aides in evaporative cooling. I also really like the angle-cut, deep pockets sewn on the back of the hip. It’s perfect for comm’s devices or bulky medical supplies that would impede hand/arm movements if placed in a front pocket. I HIGHLY recommend this product-line for any women with a build similar to mine. I wear a Medium: 5’9, slim, broad shoulder-base & 36D-36DD bust line.<br />This style/cut is my #1 go-to for function, beautiful stylish colors, prints & the perfect contoured fit."
4.0,The charm is very pretty but smaller than I expected.
4.0,I was looking the the Chris Trager from Parks and rec signature blue and red striped tie.  This was the closest to it that I could find online.  Good tie but maybe a bit too thick up top.
4.0,Great color!  Not fitted.  Buy a size down.  Wears and washes really well.
4.0,Okay not great.
4.0,It's a shirt I like the printing on the front of it. I do not dislike shirts they are nice.
4.0,Beautiful case ... but I'm afraid to use it for fear of breaking the front glass of the phone. I'm using a more protective case that supports the corners thoroughly.
4.0,Arrived in 2 days (thanks prime!). It was in a bag and smushed into my tiny mail box so I was worried it might be funky-shaped but I was able to bend the bill back to normal. It fit perfectly but has an adjustable strap just in case! I absolutely love the denim look and the embroidery is legit (not ironed on). It did smell a little plasticy/factoryish but after wearing it outside all day the smell has dimmed. I got lots of compliments today! The pin is also really cute (it's got his little pinkie raised!). All in all a killer purchase!
4.0,It's perfect I receive what I expected.
4.0,The sawing in the inside is uncomfortable.
4.0,"Love!! So cute and flattering. A little lightweight, but it’s not see-through so that’s important."
4.0,"Pros: Unlike other liner socks I've tried, these ones hide very well in my flats, don't squeeze my toes uncomfortably, and they stay on my feet pretty well. They also seem to wash well - I machine wash & dry mine, and haven't noticed any deterioration in the 1.5 months I've had them.<br /><br />Cons: The heel does slide down a little bit on occasion, but not usually all the way off. This could be because the heel silicone is not super grippy, or maybe also because I have smallish feet (womens size 6.5). The seams and edges are also a little bit bulky, so if you are wearing these in tight shoes, it may create some uncomfortable pressure in the areas where the seams and edges are. Also, the cushioning in the forefoot doesn't run all the way across the liner- instead, it's a D-shaped pad that is sewn into the center of the liner, and there is a seam that runs around the edge of the cushion, right under the ball of my foot. If you have any problems with the ball of your foot, this could be bothersome.<br /><br />Overall, I am satisfied with these liner socks. They are more comfortable and stay hidden better than the ones I had before, but I am hopeful that they will be improved further by the time I need to purchase them again."
4.0,"Decent quality, arrived quickly and came with a nice note."
4.0,Love this romper. Super cute! Only problem is I have fat arms so it is tight where the elastic part is at on the arms.
4.0,"Super cute swimsuit! Good material and looks good on! I would say that if you are debating between two sizes, you should probably size up."
4.0,The dress is good. But the color faded away after 1st wash.
4.0,"I have worn Bzees for 3 years now. My last 2 pairs were starting to fall apart, so I ordered these.  The design has changed slightly since the last purchase. Now there is a built in arch support which may not be for everyone.  It is actually a little high for me.  But I will adjust.  They've also added odor ban technology.  We'll have to see if this works.  Also, the sizing is a bit big. So I would recommend maybe going down a half size because the shoes do stretch out with wear.<br /><br />I love how comfortable Bzees are. I like that they are machine washable but do not place in dryer.  Also this Amazon price is the best that I could find online."
4.0,"Fit me well..I have 31&#34; waist,37&#34; hips.Length is also perfect..I am 32&#34; inseam.Material is nice and stretchy."
4.0,"I ordered the long robe to wear to the hospital for delivery and to wear at home after baby is born. The robe is soft, light fabric, just what I was looking for. I am 5’10”, usually size 12, and the length is great-comes to mid-calf. I ordered the extra large to fit bump (currently 39 wks pregnant), which I’m glad I did. A large would probably fit just fine without the bump. Only downside is there are no pockets on the long robe. I can deal with this for the price. I also washed this on delicate and dried on low heat (handwashing recommended) and it came out just fine."
4.0,I only wear these on occasion they are pretty cute but comfort isn’t the greatest
4.0,Good buy. works fine
4.0,Not super long. Very simple scarf.
4.0,Not good for someone who has large ankles.  Maybe they will stretch after wearing them for a while.  Otherwise sock help prevent slipping.  Good for the elderly.
4.0,"I like it, but the material makes it hard to get a good tie in the back."
4.0,"This trio of bras,comes attractively boxed. The bras are very pretty. They are padded and covered with lace. The fabric is soft, not scratchy.My set included pink, black and white. The hook and eye closure can accommodate different sizes. The straps are also adjustable. There is no wire so support is minimal. Nice for lounging or casual wear."
4.0,Made the watch look fancy. Dressed it up.
4.0,"I loved this romper for the price!<br />However , I wore pink underwear and you could kind of tell, so wear nude undergarments."
4.0,Fits perfect! great quality for the price.  I should have gotten 2.
4.0,Adorable. I ordered the size small but wish there was an extra small option. The bust area fit just fine but the waist was too big for me. My bust is 32c and my high waist is 27/28 inches. I just added a belt to help fix it. Price was good. Quality is good but not excellent- but expected at this price point. Material has some stretch but i wouldnt stretch it too far. Lovely pattern and color. Material is not thin but not thick either. I wore a slip underneath because i felt more comfortable that way. I tried adding a petticoat but it did not look good because this dress does not have a full circle skirt. This dress is very versatile. I can pair it with heels and wear it on easter or to a bridal shower and also wear it to a vintage inspired event.
4.0,It fits my daughter well thank you thank you
4.0,I received tons of compliments from women but mostly men on this green dress. I am curvy and it really accentuates your curves. It is long which I don't mind. I will wear a blazer the next time I wear it.
4.0,Very nice I got 125 was a little stronger then I thought . Will order the 1:00
4.0,Very nice case that fits my glasses with plenty of room.  Even has a cloth inside to clean your glasses.
4.0,"I have mixed feeling about this case. First it is very well built and my S8 plus would fit in very snuggly, the magnetic top case is a really nice touch. With that said, I do agree that it would be quite slippery, so the best remedy if you like this case you should get a popsocket back. The back itself is also a fingerprint galore also but that is a given when you have a glass back. Overall, if you handle your phone well and only care about hard protection, this case is good. If you're afraid of dropping it often, maybe this is not the best one."
4.0,Me gusto mucho! El como moldea el cuerpo y se mira muy bien.
4.0,Megusto mucho yo los recomindo que lo compre.
4.0,"As others have mentioned, due to the laws of gravity, this ""chest"" bag is going to slide down and become a hip bag or messenger bag.  To prevent that from happening, you'll have to clip it to your backpack shoulder straps. If you're not wearing a backpack, you can clip it to a belt loop. There are two rings at the bottom of the bag for the shoulder strap: one for the left and one for the right. Whichever one you're not using, clip a bungee cord or something there and hook it to your belt.<br /><br />The other negative is the water bottle pocket. No water bottle will fit in there. I put a C cell led flashlight in there. That's the most it will hold.<br /><br />Besides those two things, it's okay."
4.0,"Crazy print for tropical theme party. Fabric very thin and silky, causes clingy feel.  Runs really big"
4.0,"Super soft, but large!"
4.0,Material is a bit thin and see through but overall happy with dress.
4.0,It’s of good quality and comfortable to wear
4.0,"The main stones aren't so huge that they immediately scream ""fake"". They aren't quite extremely high quality cubic zirconia either, they lose the sparkle at some angles. The setting for the small stones in the halos is completely wrong, it is not an open back setting so that right there also helps lose a star, however it is not extremely obvious except upon inspection when not wearing the ring. As far as it actually being genuine silver, time will tell. I am one of those whose skin chemistry will not allow me to wear anything but gold, sterling silver, or platinum. Anything else will turn my skin under it green as can be. I've been wearing this often but not continuously, and so far it's still beautiful. The setting is extremely unique and I get many compliments on it."
4.0,"Out of the 7 watches I just ordered, it's by far my daily go to watch. Looks good and compliments my attire."
4.0,This is sturdy. It's got a nice chain and seems well put together. But IRS not the color pictured the blue is spot on but the eyes are a darker real. I would have like the color to be the same as shown but It's still lovely.
4.0,"The quality was good, but I would definitely recommend going up a size. My grandson is a size 12, I purchased the medium, and it was way too smug. If you are closer to a size 12, definitely go with the large.."
4.0,"I find these to be a little baggy in the legs but this does make them roomy enough for free movement; just not stylish by any means. A good pair of pants for hiking, camping, etc. Versatile enough and the material stretches comfortably. Lightweight enough for summer wear as long or as shorts."
4.0,"I loved this pants! The fit is perfect I ordered a size XL, I am 172lbs, 5.7. Fits perfect! My only concern is the amount of distress it has, it's to close to the crotch for my taste. I also ordered a size L just incase and I noticed the distress is different, so I am probably going to order it again hopefully the distress looks better."
4.0,very pretty.  metal is very thin though. hope closure holds up.  received item quickly.
4.0,These are beautiful. I ordered them to wear on my birthday (October 2017). They came in good time but there was a small crack on one of them. Very disappointed but all in all it will complete your look.
4.0,Nice looking purse! I am enjoying it!
4.0,Pretty good shoes a little small but workable. A bit slippery also
4.0,"Looks great, doesn't last long... it will break"
4.0,Very cute. Well made for the great price!
4.0,Very nice. Material is kind of stiff. Can be worn at the shoulders if desired. Slits go up the leg pretty far but it's not racy. Excellent dress for the price.
4.0,A little on small side. Love the fabric. Really soft. Was not expecting it being so nice.  So much so I ordered another pair and purchased a couple of the hoodies from this brand. Bought the traditional camo.
4.0,"Not heavy duty construction, but good enough for travel use.  I would not use for real outdoor gear (this aint no Gregory, but it is 1/10 the price too).  Kind of an ok imitation of a North Face pack, but its good enough for light travel, Disney, etc.  I actually bought another one for use on a DC tourist type vacation next year.  Pleased with the value for the price paid ($20 or so)"
4.0,Material is thin. Needed to wear a slip for modesty.
4.0,"Great for the money, but I tend to lose them in the shower every few months. They pop loose when I wash my hair. Comfortable to sleep in. Don't even realize they're in my ears."
4.0,"The item was cute, fabric good<br />but it ran s bit small for me<br />(I usually wear a XL)<br />Appreciate being able to<br />retirn for credit. !!!"
4.0,It's working in deep packets
4.0,This was a great buy. Fits and looks great. It is definitely a skimpy bikini. So if that's what you want that's what you'll get.
4.0,Great!!! Perfect!!! Every dress Wednesday my daughter wears them. Playground and on her toes.
4.0,It’s super accurate to the lockets in the show. Even the chain is the same. The chain rusts really easily and tarn-x doesn’t seem to work on it though.
4.0,"I love that you just continually wrap it around and just adjust the buckle.  It does slide around a bit, that is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5.  I do love it though."
4.0,"Ordered this swimsuit to wear in Aruba for my birthday. I’m very curvy. The fit was snug, but I didn’t have any issues. I liked that it covered me up good. My letters didn’t come off in the water. I was expecting to see them floating in the ocean, but they stayed in place thank goodness. I can tell they will eventually peel off, but I don’t really plan to wear it again if that happens. It served its purpose for me for the b-day."
4.0,"This skirt is so darn adorable! I love the print on it and it is a heavier weight material not in the least bit cheap in my opinion. It is unlined but definitely not see through. It has an elastic backed waist and a side zipper. Apparently, I miss judged my size  because it was a bit tight on me but that I a &#34;me&#34; problem and nothing that some shapewear cant assist with.<br /><br />I am uber excited to wear this lil number to work!"
4.0,"Very comfortable to wear and a bit revealing, just enough for him to think it's sexy!!!"
4.0,"I really love this. Well crafted, and dainty without being so small u can't notice it. Fit true to size, and sits very comfortably on the finger. The only thing keeping this from 5 stars for me is that the green color on the knotwork of the ring does not stand out in contrast to the rest of the ring quite so much as it appears on here. In fact in certain lighting the green looks pretty dull, almost a grayish-green and I would have been slightly happier with it if the green was a lil brighter and really ""popped"" a bit more. That said, I am still very pleased with it, it was an early birthday present to myself as a very Irish girl born on St.Patty's day :)"
4.0,A tad smaller than I wanted even though they stretch... I do like the material.
4.0,"Because I travel daily on the Metro, I am adding a few security measures... Snaps to keep the front flap closed and discourage thiefs who have sticky fingers...  I'm also looking into adding strap padding....<br /><br />Otherwise... GREAT product...worth the price...."
4.0,"Very nice jacket, super cute and arrived quickly, weeks before the estimated time. Careful when ordering, runs small.... I ordered a Medium (China-XL) with the size comparison to US measurements and I can't button up at all."
4.0,"I thought this would run small but it runs very large.  XL fit like 3XL and I returned it for a roomy large and will order medium if I order another color.<br /> I am 5 ft 8 and 175lb.  I returned for a large and could still go down a size. If it was expensive I would give less stars for the construction of it but this is really cheap and at or below the quality that Target carries if that gives you an idea.  I would put the quality squarely in the Walmart level.  My boyfriend found it sexy so I order another color, at this price, why not?  It shows skin and has lace.  That seems to be the ticket for men ;-)"
4.0,I feel comfortable and supported in this bra. It definitely would cost $45-50 in a store
4.0,"Nice bracelet, but I ordered the wrong side.  I will gift it to someone in my family with a larger wrist."
4.0,"Good quality and make, but runs way too small. Had to return it"
4.0,Muito Obrigado !
4.0,"the case is supposed to be for extra large sunglasses  but I have not been able to use it for my oversized, over prescription glasses sunglasses if I force the glasses I can squeeze them in the case but the top wont close, I will keep the case I think I can use it for another purpose or to keep an extra pair of glasses"
4.0,"Average one;<br /><br />Look is not that great, but worth for money."
4.0,I wish they came in all half sizes.  9 is a touch snug and 10 would be too big.  Hoping to wear them for shorter periods to break in and eventually they'll be more comfortable.  Love the style though and the price was great!
4.0,Love the dress.  It hangs nice and doesn't wrinkle.  I have had several complements on it which is always a PLUS!
4.0,"They fit my girls ok. I bought two, I wish they carried one size smaller. It fit my 5 yr old great but I’m going to have to adjust the hem for her as well as my 4 yr old."
4.0,"Its really nice quality shirt. The only problem is size. I read size chart and Large was my recommend it size, but reading other reviews i quickly discover Large will be way to big for me so i ordered Medium and its still very, very loose. Im not tiny person in any meaning i usually buy my shirts size 8-10 depending on chest space and that shirt is still hanging on me so i would say cut down at leas 2 sizes down looking at the chart and that's for a loose fit. But for what it costs its well worth it. its warm and cozy, perfect for snuggling on the couch."
4.0,I wear a 12 but ordered a 2XL and it fits perfect. Make sure you check the size chart before ordering.
4.0,"It's ok, nothing to lose your head"
4.0,I ordered this initially to wear to work as I like more conservative clothing. I ordered it thinking it was more of a blouse. When it arrived I realized it is more casual than it is dressy. I usually wear large and ordered it in x-large to have a looser fit. It ended up being perfect for leggings because it dips down in the middle so it is perfect to cover and still look good.
4.0,"I really like these belts.  The only reason that it didn't get 5 stars was that the buckle is heavy.  It would be a great defense in a street fight but way too heavy.  By the time I add my wallet (slim) and cell phone to the belt buckles weight, my pants want to fall down.  Come up with a lighter weight material.  Beyond that I love the belt.  Have purchased 3 of them."
4.0,"Tela suave y de algodón, tamaño exacto quizás un poquitito más grande que lo normal<br />Es una blusa corte A , la base es bastante amplia."
4.0,"bought these Mini Chocolaticas for my grand daughters 5th birthday, she loves them! good colors and look very comfortable for her!"
4.0,I love the style and fit of this dress; I just wish it flared out as pictured. I will have to order one of those skirt flares to tie in the whole look. Overall happy with my purchase.
4.0,Im 5'6&#34; 180lbs and ordered an CO.  Fits a little snug but o absolutely love this romper.
4.0,Cute product.  I have a wide calf and would not recommend these for that. I will keep because I wore them.
4.0,"These seem a little softer and thinner than the original loops on my Fossil watch thus a 4 rating but they work just fine. Only time will tell. For what they are, they could be considered a little pricey but it is certainly better than having to purchase a new band. So try them."
4.0,"Yo no soy alta asi que me quedo al tobillo y la manga 3/4 me quedo manga larga pero no es problema para mi, asi que me lo puse y recibi muchos elogios, soy talla 8 y justo me quedo, tuve que poner una blusa abajo por que en la cintura la cinta negra tiene ollitos y yo no enseño nada pero es cuestion de gustos."
4.0,Love the colors. I had to adjust to the clinging around the hips. Thought it was an &#34;A-Line&#34; top til I tried them on.
4.0,I love I love everything about this nightgown the weight of the material the feel of the material the color is saturated nice and deep the arm holes are not cut too wide the collar is not cut too low my only complaint is that it runs large
4.0,Bought this for another individual at work. His reply was it was bigger than it looked in the picture. Other than that he seems satisfied with it.
4.0,Super cute. It was a little smaller than what I thought it would be. Gift receiver was happy.
4.0,"Gift for my wife. She loves it.  The only downside that she has found is that there is no pocket for her cell phone. Other than that, she really enjoys it."
4.0,Very pretty. But not the one I ordered
4.0,I am always leery about ordering tanks online as I like them a bit loose and want it to heat below the hip. And you never know how the sizing is regardless of if you refer to the &#34;Sizing Chart&#34;.  This tank was perfect.  I ordered an XL and it fit's as expected and sits below the waist (hip area) as wanted.  I ordered 2 other ones with this one and then I just ordered 3 more in different colors.
4.0,My grandson loves this hat.
4.0,"comfy work pants or pajama pants, love these, very thin for summer time"
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:a62a04116fe0f026d6ef2f5d2e8c3197]] Bought this new from Amazon few months ago.  The off-white numbers are nicely placed and easy to read at a glance, and probably one of the nicest layouts I have seen, and syncs fine each night via radio signal.  Battery life is great, but does need direct sun every few weeks for 10 min or so.  One negative is the glass, its mineral and scratches easily.  I bought a screen protector that does need to be replaced every now and then."
4.0,They are nice. Size seems slightly odd compared to when I buy them at stores. Slightly bigger on top of foot area.<br />They will work for my needs unless this part stretches out. Then I'll be unhappy. Right now...good.
4.0,"This dress is gorgeous. Its perfect for a nice dinner or any formal event.  The color is spectacular and the sleeves are gorgeous. The length is about an inch above my knees ( Im 5”2”). The only con is that the dress runs small, so I had to return a medium for a large. (I weigh 140 lbs)."
4.0,"Cute top, runs just a hair big.  I'm 5'4'' 140lbs and ordered a medium and it's just a little bit big, but still very cute and comfortable."
4.0,"I like the beautiful embroiderie but it is way too short! I'm 5'9, size 6 and it doesn't cover my butt.  It's very pretty and doesn't hang like the model in the pic unless you are very very short."
4.0,Wasn’t sure if should have ordered the medium or large. I order the medium and fits but I would have liked it a little looser.  I’m 5’4” 140lbs. I feel like it will accidentally swing open below the waist. But I like the robe and probably will buy again but in a large.
4.0,Very stylish hat  and I got compliments whenever I wore it.  I did return it as it was a little small when I first bought it and I got caught in a downpour and it seemed like it shrunk when it dried out.<br />Contacted customer service at Coolibar and they were WONDERFUL to work with!
4.0,Looks good. On my narrow wrist fits much better than big watches since this designed along length. Friends and colleagues have shown interest. I have used it for a month with no problems.
4.0,"The headbands are cute and the print is whats shown in the picture, they are a soft stretchy material so they can fit on a toddlers head. Cute"
4.0,"True to Size, Large Clear 'rainbow' Gem, Shines Brightly but Mostly green, pinks and a yellowish orange, difficult to get it to shine blue. Skulls on either side of center stone are large & defined enough to be noticed while still maintaining a subtleness. Tall Profile at nearly .5 inch/13mm"
4.0,"This is a pretty top.  I purchased it specifically to wear with leggings, so for length as well as style.  Even after washing, it's a little looser fitting than I like, so I'm currently looking for a dress clip to give it the shape in the waist that I prefer...I think then it'll be just right!  I usually wear a size Large, or within the size 10-12 range in Misses sizes.  I hope that information will help others decide what size is right for them.<br /><br />The fabric is pretty lightweight, which is fine for the climate where I live; sort of a light t-shirt material."
4.0,"I was looking for some shorts for hanging around the house doing some chores or just chilling.  These are perfect.  I wear them like you'd wear ""grubs"" or ""scrubs"".  The only thing I don't like is the pocket isn't big enough for my phone.  It fall out of the pocket when walking or sitting."
4.0,"A little tight, when putting on, for medium size.  Once on, gloves fit good.  Very soft, supple leather."
4.0,"Very nice bathing suit. I bought an XL and it fits just right. Only issue is that if you have big hips, it may be difficult to get on since the neckline is small with a zipper and the only way to put it on is to pull it up. Otherwise I love it."
4.0,Waist rolls up
4.0,Cute dress that fits as expected.
4.0,"These were nice, but not amazing. They looked a little cheap- but hey they're only $8.99! Unfortunately amazon thought it was a good idea to ship them in a padded mailer so the posts were severely bent when they arrived but they remedied the problem."
4.0,"the effect is not really great but its there and it's minimal, bitter than nothing"
4.0,A good little pile of nice bracelets!!! Really worth the money.
4.0,"I love this dress! Super comfy and soft. I am 5'8"" about 160lb and ordered the medium, which actually is bigger than I expected. I would suggest ordering a size down. Over all I am happy with my order and have no problem with it being a little big. With my height I wasn't expecting it to be long enough but the length is perfect too!"
4.0,Pretty and nice material.  I needed a different size. So returned and ordered different size.
4.0,Love this hat.! Fits perfect and feels good.
4.0,"So far, really good. Living in Arizona is living in sunglasses. So needless to say cheap sunglasses do not last. In fact most don't last a month. These Carifa SG's seem to be built very stout. (that means really strong for you millennials). The fit is great, the comfort is fantastic. They look great. Not too small, not too large. Like a said, so far really good."
4.0,"It was in fact my fault they are. Too long. I ordered the biggest size out of fear they'd be to small.. they're even long on my boyfriend that's 6'2 haha. However they're super comfy, and I would buy from them again, even though it took weeks to get my package because they lost it"
4.0,"I'm trying to make the habit of taking one a day. This peals may be OK,  I have to take at least one bottle before I can recommend it."
4.0,"We used these as Advent gifts for my Granddaughter; they were individually wrapped, :so perfect as little gifts. The colors are very pretty, the only reason I didn't give it a &#34;5&#34; rating is how long the metal will last."
4.0,Fits perfect. My daughter wears a medium and it fit perfectly.
4.0,"This necklace is just as beautiful and grand and sparkly in person as it appears in the picture. As far as costume jewelry goes, this is fairly well made.  The base and chains are sturdy. The stones are arranged and set nicely, and the weight is evenly distributed so it's not heavy and hangs well.  However, the only con is the clasp of my particular necklace was defective. It looked big and strong enough - but in fact, the clasp was so flimsy, the latch portion immediately broke off when I attempted to wear it the first time. Ultimately, I decided to buy a replacement clasp since I really love the piece and don't want to be bothered with exchanging online.  That is why I gave it 4 out of 5 stars."
4.0,It’s beautiful. Have received so many compliments. Well made and looks just like the picture.
4.0,So cute! Everyone loved this on her!
4.0,"Very nice, comfortable, cool but see through"
4.0,Awesome gift idea. My best friend loved it
4.0,"Very cute, perfect gift for my sister in law"
4.0,"The bras were a nice material, seemed well made, the two fit completely differently though. 1 fit well, the other was too big and shaped different."
4.0,"Fit kind of small, but the little give in the material made it fit AMAZING! My husband loves it too! 😉"
4.0,These are cute. I found them a big snug.
4.0,I did not like the side zipper and the dress was very long on me.  I’m 5’1.  I returned the dress with no problems..I also did not like the way the front of the dress looked on me.....the material was very ice and the color was awesome...I wish I could have kept it!
4.0,I usually wear small but this one is a little bit bigger for me.  I was thinking to return the other 2 that I bought.  But overall rating the product was awesome..
4.0,I was looking for a front closure sports bra with good support while jogging.  I'm very happy with this bra.  It met all my expectations/hopes!
4.0,exactly as described except the size of the jewelry is much smaller than i imagined. Cute though
4.0,Love it but metal bends easy
4.0,"Great glasses and a great price, but they do scratch pretty easy"
4.0,"I really loved this skirt. A medium was just way too small. Usually wear a 10-12 but couldn't even pull it over my hips, or shoulder. Should have ordered XL at minimum. I keep checking back to see if it's ever available in that size. So far, not yet."
4.0,Wish it was on a different chain
4.0,"This top is loose through the midsection so the fit is pretty unflattering when I'm full, bending down, etc."
4.0,"I’m almost 5’7” and about 180lbs with like a 40-42” chest. My experience with the “econo” chest binder was this: I got a Large size NUDE color and it fit me weirdly loose a little but I purchased a Medium BLACK and it fit super small. For me, spending the extra money on the regular binder (997 model) in a LARGE size fits perfect. And in general, as advice, do not buy a size smaller with binders."
4.0,"Very dark, darker then any sun glasses that i bought for the price on your thing I don't like is that &#34;arms&#34; aren't that comfortable to ware for an extended period of time. They sit at on your ears at an awkward angle but others might have a different opinion."
4.0,"The pattern is a beautiful, thats why I had to have it, even though they didnt have the size i wanted. I had to go smaller, my chest was too big, so I wore it with a red dress underneath and wore it like a coat, it looked amazing. I love the fabric, It has a linen feel to it."
4.0,"The ties are a little short. Very lightweight fabric, will not stop heavy duty spills. Will work for light jobs."
4.0,Nice with a different look
4.0,"Product looks well-made. Will be testing it out today. HOWEVER, I paid for one-day shipping but received it later than scheduled."
4.0,I gave it 4 stars because the dress is really nice!...but my boob kept popping out. It isn’t something that’s going to stay in place. So I will be returning it.
4.0,This is for Christmas. It looks beautiful. I love stretch bracelets. The only downfall would be if the bracelet is not tied well. I have had other bracelets similar only to have the tie off point not tied well. This is well done.
4.0,"These are awesome! They are clear, not white but I love that look! Well made from what I can tell and I like having both blue and yellow tints :)"
4.0,This shirt is one of the best fitting ones I've gotten from Amazon.
4.0,Toms fit snuggly. They may seem &#34;tight&#34; when you first put them on but they are true to size and sort of strecth out / mold to your feet after a few wears.<br /><br />Love this particular design. Cool but goes with everything.<br />I wish it had a black sole but whatcha gonna do???!!
4.0,Look nice and feel great in my ears. Just wish they had better backings. Gift from my wonderful husband and I couldn't have been more pleased.
4.0,I really like the lightweight material. Unfortunately when it came up on my Vine queue it didn't post a size. So it's easy too small for. So I passed it on to a neighbor. I like it enough that I just may purchase one in the correct size come spring.
4.0,"It's smaller than I expected; a little tight in the bust. Otherwise, the cut and flare are very nice."
4.0,Nice clasp that looks well made. But pins of an odd design that makes compressing the spring to install/remove difficult.
4.0,"This is such a lovely dress. It's super loose and flowy, without being frumpy, and I love the pockets. I can't bear the top of it, though. It's tighter there, especially at the arm area. While it's not skin tight, it rubs uncomfortably, especially on the underside of my arms. The rest of the dress is so wonderful and comfortable, it's incredibly disappointing. Maybe if I'd went up one size, it would have worked better. (I went with my normal size.)"
4.0,"Good sunglasses, but the padding on the ends comes off easily"
4.0,"Really like it but feel they should be more transparent that the stones don't go all the way around. But kept and like, pretty and unique, cool design, detail."
4.0,"This watch is gorgeous, even nicer than the Dalvey Half-hunter it replaced. People ask about it when I pull it out.<br /><br />Only downside is,  with the busy gears and works visible behind the watch face, the main &#34;hands&#34; are difficult to see sometimes. They (hour and minute hands) are bright blue, but still can be almost invisible at certain angles, and in certain lights.<br /><br />Make no mistake, I would buy it again.  Note too that it is mailed from England somewhere, and delivery takes awhile by Amazon standards.<br /><br />S.J. Britt"
4.0,Definitely a warm sweater. Not the softest yarn but not as abrasive or irritating as wool. It's thick but not too heavy.
4.0,comfortable but too big
4.0,"The material is kind of a shiny stretchy nylon, a little too close to being like an undergarment... you'll definitely want to wear it under a tunic. But, that said, the ankle straps are super cute. My best friend says I need to wear these often. I think I might like them better in cotton."
4.0,"I BEYOND appreciate the concern that had for previous review,  they had an honest inquiry about me as a customer.<br />My happiness was a prime issue. I am more than happy to change my rating.<br />This was greatly deserved!!!!<br />Thank You, Thank You Again.<br />The new ones are lovely!!!"
4.0,Sizing could be more accurate
4.0,I love it!!! I need to order another one that's a bit smaller but for now I'm wearing this one.....I'm between sizes
4.0,Apart from the same small pieces in every package they are really cute! I placed them all in alcohol for 4 min and I put the earring part in the dangles in alcohol as well. They are stylish and they can be dressed down. I personally like them a lot apart from the same small pairs.
4.0,"no complaints, fits true to its size."
4.0,"Del Rossa boxers are great.  I have been wearing them for years now and they are not only comfortable, but durable.  My recent order was simply to replace a few pair that eventually wore out.  The size thing might be a bit tricky... I wear a size 32&#34; pant, but wear a large in the boxers.  After the online warning I never tried the mediums..... don't care... these shorts beat cotton any day."
4.0,"Nice color and comfortable but I bought a pair of new jeans for the first time in ages.  Usually buy in thrift stores.  I'm looking for something that won't bag on the back side of the legs and although I bought a size down - 10, I think I should have gone to an 8."
4.0,This is very beautiful but too small. so I have to return. good for small size girls
4.0,"Everything I expected, diamonds fall off the pretty ones but see through and regular ball very durable"
4.0,"Did not like the fact that the waist of the shorts did not stay up. It continually rolled down with walking, bending or just sitting.  Otherwise they are nice biker shorts.  Gave it 4 stars for the waist issue."
4.0,"Bought this for my 14yr old to be in her sisters wedding, I had to buy 2 different dresses so I could see which fit her best. So this one she love it the feel and comfort it was soft and stretchy and as you can see you would need a slip you can see her panty line. It looks so cute on her.  But the color was NOT the hunter green in the picture it is more of a blueish color that will not match the wedding.  So we will be returning it. If we had any place for her to wear it I would keep it but we have nothing else coming up that needs a dress that fancy."
4.0,"This dress is great!! The fabric is nice, not too thin and perfect for summer. It fits well, no issues with sizing, I just got what size I normally would wear. The only downside I see is the straps, I wish they were adjustable. But even though they aren't, they are a good length."
4.0,Arrived in time and fit as expected.
4.0,"This bag looks nice (keep in mind it is not made of real leather) and it is quite large. Ideal for carrying tablets, books and other bulky staff. As a mom, I appreciate the value of a bag that can fit all I need in one place. It comes in a neutral beige color with some grey and black details. The metals are golden and it a longer strap is included. It is a practical bag for everyday use."
4.0,Bought for my kids birthday parties. An okay assortment but too many black balloons in my opinion.
4.0,Besutiful for a girl!!!
4.0,The glasses are made of good quality and are not to expensive.
4.0,"This suit is great quality, however the leg holes fit really tight and made it uncomfortable. Top part fit great!"
4.0,"Cool, just what I wanted"
4.0,I like this bracelet and it fits me perfectly and is pretty!  I didn't give 5 stars because I am not sure about the magnetic therapy.
4.0,"You can definitely tell it's a cheap scarf/shawl. Very light, not much weight to it.<br />I bought them to put in these goodie baskets that I made for teacher gifts for Christmas. They were perfect for that."
4.0,"Love the dress' design elements, but much larger than I expected so had to return the medium for a small."
4.0,"Beautiful scarf, but took longer than expected to arrive. Very thin and lightweight."
4.0,This is pretty much exactly as shown in the photo. 5’6 132 lbs. medium for perfect. Great price on a trendy jacket you might not wear next season. Didn’t shed
4.0,Very pretty. Nice length. Makes a great gift.
4.0,"I needed something to connect to an Arduino to play a single specific sound effect so I checked this out. It didn't come with any instructions, aside from what's in the description that says what all the buttons do.<br /><br />There are no screw terminals or pins to be able to easily connect something (like an Arduino) to it to control it remotely, so I planned on soldering to the button pads directly but some reviews mentioned it would start playing on power up and I was able to confirm this was true. I ended up soldering onto the BAT (+/-) pads, grounding the (-) and just using an Arduino GPIO pin to trigger a relay to send 5V directly to BAT+. The BAT inputs aren't well documented either but I metered the pads while I powered the board with a micro USB cable and it read 5V across the BAT pads so I assumed it was safe to go with 5V.<br /><br />For the record, the description implies that you can drive the board with ~3-5V so I assume that implies the BAT input since USB is 5V. The description also states that the board should be powered by 5V if using a USB stick for the audio files as most USB sticks need 5V to be read and I can confirm this was my experience as well (powering board off of 3.7V turned the board on but didn't play off if USB stick until I changed it to 5.1V).<br /><br />Overall this board worked for what I needed--to play a single sound file with an action controlled by an Arduino, and the fact that it starts auto playing on power on made this relatively easy to achieve, but I do have a couple of notes:<br /><br />1. The single audio file loops by default--this wasn't a huge deal for me as I just set the Arduino output to keep the relay on just long enough for the audio file to play once+the power on delay from this sound board from power on->start playing.<br /><br />2. The board emits a POP at power on and power off. This one was a bigger deal for me as it's kind of annoying but otherwise the sound does play as expected. I get that it's from the internal amplifier circuit but I'm sure it could be avoided with better circuitry/programming. If it really ends up bugging me in the long run, I'll setup a relay to keep the speaker line open until just after power on where the pop would be and again after the audio ends but before powering the board off.<br /><br />3. Don't expect hi fidelity out of this thing, it was $7.<br /><br />This isn't the best sounding or most versatile option for this kind of job, but it's good enough and it's relatively inexpensive."
4.0,Great product for what you pay for (quality and everything)
4.0,Nice dress. Fits nicely. It's just a little more sheer than I had hoped. But I bought a slip and it works. Very light a flowy.
4.0,"I was happy with my purchase though I wish I would have bought a medium instead of a large. It's pretty, comfy, and flattering."
4.0,"Product was delivered but completely tarnished, already. I’m going to have to clean it before I can gift it. Cute packaging box though!"
4.0,"its very warm during the cold weather and the kids love wearing the pajamas, good fitting"
4.0,This is a knit like material that is soft. It looks great over a dress or pants and a cami. The material was a bit thinner than I anticipated but overall I am happy with the fit and style.
4.0,"Very comfortable sweatshirt.<br />Since the buttons come down fairly low, you do have to make sure you have something on underneath."
4.0,"wore this to help brighten the spirits of the neighborhood kids during the stay at home orders. the kids LOVED it and it was so much fun in this costume. i'd give it 5 stars except for you have to have someone else zip you in and out of the costume so you can't escape on your own. also my pink tutu in real life wasn't as fluffy and full as the picture and dumped so much glitter everywhere i went. otherwise, i would have given it a full 5. its easy to wear and the inside straps are super helpful to keep the costume secure to your body. great purchase!"
4.0,Bought to replace shoe laces for my 8 yr old. They're kind of small for his kwiss shoes. Size 2
4.0,Came before arrival. There soft shoes period. Pretty sure I can make them work with an outfit. But they don't look exactly like the picture just because there soft
4.0,My son is going to love these!
4.0,"the sweater on the model shows it at her hips, the sweater on me came to my ribs. I knew it was cropped, but the picture showed it longer than I thought it would be. Other than that, the sweater is very nice."
4.0,"These legging are buttery soft, perfect length for a capri and the colors are vivid and beautiful.<br />I genraly wear a size 12 pant and ordered an x-large and they fit beautifully. I may have been able to order a large but I didnt want them too tight."
4.0,Its very cute but looks a little rusty? Not sure almost like it was won before but still very cute.
4.0,"I like the wide brim and bright colors. Adjustable size, only wish the Velcro was a bit stronger."
4.0,This was a nice dress but was to big. The fabric is very thic material. Not a flowing summer dress. If kept I would wear it during the winter.
4.0,This dress is so comfy and stylish. Got lots of compliments on the colours and style. Great value for the price. Needs no ironing.
4.0,Really beautiful on! The dress flows well and is extremely comfortable. The way the fabric lays it does a great job of hiding any imperfections. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because you can see through it when the sun shines. I bought a slip to go with it and that did the trick.
4.0,Only thing I had an issue with was adjusting the band. But once I figured it out - piece of cake!
4.0,"I have an obsession with dias de los muertos, sugar skulls, and la catrina so this is the perfect wallet for me.  I've never had a wallet with this much storage before, there's pocket everywhere!!  I bought this about 2 years ago, and the only thing i'm a little disappointed about is the metallic pink strap and zipper pull are turning gray because the pink is cracking off of it.  The rest of the wallet is in good condition and it's definitely durable (except for the zipper pull and strap).  I still use the wallet today!"
4.0,Bought them as a gift.  She loved them but they are a bit thin (not see through) and had a small tear around the knee..
4.0,Good cup.prop sticks sometimes but not often
4.0,"I really like this bra, even though I am wide around the rib cage so its a bit snug there, but I am slowly losing weight and that will take care of it and is no fault of the bra.... A really good tee shirt bra."
4.0,"These are really cute statement earrings.  They don’t fan out in a perfect 180 degrees which is a good thing (to me) cuz that means they aren’t as big as look on the petite models.  The pink is a salmon pink.  I deducted 1 star cuz they don’t come with safety backs.  But they do come in a GORGEOUS high-end, unmarked gift box. Something you wouldn’t throw away."
4.0,"I got this from Burlington for $24.99. It is exactly as pictured and from the exact same company (Pink Platinum). My daughter is 4 and wears a size 4 so I bought the 4T which is the largest size I believe and it fits bigger than expected. She has more than enough space (especially in the legs). She says it's warm and it has a nice little weight to it. She hasn't worn it out yet because our weather hasn't been cold enough for it (Chicago), but I'll give an update."
4.0,Affordable. The cups don't block all the light. There's a very noticeable light leak around your nose.
4.0,"This sweatshirt is a nice soft material inside and smooth doesn't pill up on the outside, it's just a little thinner than I expected but that's fine it's still a great hoody."
4.0,I love these because they're so cute! They can get a little loose but stay in place for the most part. The only other problem I had is that the black pint chips pretty easily but you can fix with a sharpie
4.0,Size down. Got my normal band size and it’s a little loose. Nothing that stops me from wearing it but be aware:)
4.0,It's very nice but keeps slipping up on the shoulders.
4.0,They hold so when I bend down they stay in place
4.0,Doesn’t stay up very well
4.0,"This dress looked so much better than I expected. A little short, but really attractive styling."
4.0,"I'm 5&#34;4 size 18, and I ordered the XL after taking measurements, when it arrived and I tried it on, I realized I could have ordered a size smaller. It is very soft and comfortable! Great for the price"
4.0,Like the feel of the material. Seems all of these kind are extremely long. I am 5'4. Does not matter to me. It just gathers around the ankle. Not as tight as I would have liked.
4.0,These are cute and I’m using six right now for a piece. Disappointed that 50 didn’t come in my pack. I counted twice to make sure. At least I got 40.
4.0,Thick material is super soft but not as distressed as pictured.  I can’t complain because it looks really good and it’s super comfy.  They should probably just update the images so people aren’t disappointed.<br />The image is really cute.  I haven’t washed yet but I will be sure to be gentle with it.
4.0,"These run small, but it worked out. My daughter tried it on and it fit her perfectly, she wears a large.  (this was a XXL) So it wasn't a total loss."
4.0,I hoped that it would be a bit warmer. Love the color.
4.0,"Kind of big for my neck, as I was expecting to be able to wear it as a choker, but overall it is a cute necklace! I would definitely recommend for the price, but next time I'll either make my own or go on Etsy."
4.0,7 yo grandson loves them. He says they are the perfect material and supercomfy. They are slightly shorter than his other boxer briefs and don't hang out the bottom of his shorts when sitting.
4.0,This company dresses are too SHORT!!!!!
4.0,nice ring and light.
4.0,Sleeves a little long but otherwise great shirt
4.0,"Very comfortable, decent construction, flattering design and quite affordable. I wore this to my work Christmas party and it was great! The only small complaint I did have was the back of the skirt, where it attached to the body looked a bit puffed up when I tried it on at first, but wearing pantyhose under the dress it looked fine. I think the fabric just didn't cling to the pantyhose. But I got many compliments and cannot beat the price."
4.0,"I could see pretty early on that the fabric was going to be thin and cheapish. I still bought it anyway, because I loved the color and I knew it would be comfy. That being said, starching this baby really takes it up a notch in terms of appeal. The sleeves are definitely disproportionate, so I ended up thinning them out a bit as well."
4.0,I use it before I shampoo my hair.  Seem to aid in cleansing my scalp.
4.0,"This is a little bigger than I imagined it, but I like it. I bought it for my adult son because he enjoys Poker."
4.0,It was a little snug getting on even though I ordered a large. But once it was on it fit like a clothes and feels so good. It does shut in short on the armpits so that weird little chubby piece in between your armpit in your chest sticks out a lot. But it's not too bad. Overall super cute sports bra.
4.0,I like the texture and color. I have a bigger butt than belly so it fits nice in front and too short in back
4.0,The pants fit well. expect it is more of a cream color instead of white.
4.0,My head circumstance is 58cm and its very tight
4.0,[[VIDEOID:b4c17c5f70aac815422872b1a6d0e143]] Got this costume for my son’s 5th Birthday Party. He is in love with it!!! I ordered him a size medium and thought I got his measurements right. He measured at 43 inches so he was in between the small and medium size. I decided to go with the medium size just because the small was meant for 41 inches tall.  It’s a little on the bigger side but it’s okay because he can grow into it.<br /><br />The only thing I wish is for the mask to be made with the same material they used for the jumpsuit. The mask is made out of foam. My son also wish that the mask covered the whole head and not just the face. It also would had been cool if they had put a hole in the mouth area of the mask. This is the reason for 4 stars.<br /><br />I will do an update later on this weekend to see how this costume holds up during his party. Please let me know if this review help. As I like to read other reviews before I purchase items.
4.0,Got it as a gift from my girlfriend. Watch face and accuracy were on point. Wouldve given it 5 stars but the fixed ring that holds the slack band after adjustment in place broke within 3 weeks.
4.0,like the fit!
4.0,I liked the wallet but it was too small for my needs.
4.0,"Excellent value, sturdy construction. A little smaller than I expected.  Good price."
4.0,"It's a nice, sleek looking watch. I do like the color but I see it will begin to fade after a while. Primarily mine has been on the corners."
4.0,just like my bill-a-bongs 1/4 price
4.0,The headband was a little too small even while let out all the way but not that big an issue.
4.0,"This was purchased as a gift for a teenaged girl who is very into Doctor Who.  She loved the necklace!  It is a nice piece of jewelry given how incredible inexpensive the item was.  I am very pleased with the fact the item arrived prior to the estimated delivery date.  I did not contact the seller, there was no need to do so, as it was a smooth, fast and efficient transaction."
4.0,After wearing them a couple time one of the back tabs broke.
4.0,"Very nice, grandaughter loved it."
4.0,good value and don't need to worry about losing them
4.0,Keeps shirts nicely tucked.
4.0,"I was pleasantly surprised by these cute, easy to use earrings.  So much so that I searched for and bought a larger hoop pair.  They are quite small but still a great item for casual wear."
4.0,pretty dang good for the price. and helps keep a riggers belt in its place if using the correct side of hook and loop
4.0,Came in a nice carrier bag. Works fine.
4.0,"I received my bracelet.  It is beautiful and gemstones are of good quality.  The Labradorite beads have a nice &#34;Labradorescence&#34; effect, and the Variscite colors are excellent.  I only wish this seller could make similar bracelets where the beads are larger.  Overall, I am very satisfied with my order."
4.0,Beautiful dress.....it really is.  Very comfy but if you have a bit of a tummy that you aren't comfortable showing???  Pass this up or do more crunches....lol !!  It really is very pretty & well made.  It's not flimsy at all......so.....maybe the crunches will win out!  They are for me!
4.0,"I'm a 36D, and XL fit well.  I don't need the padding, so threw them away.  The bras provide the support I need for medium to hard impact workouts.  They keep me from bouncing all over the place, which is what I need in a sports bra.  The colors are vibrant, and they washed up well in the laundry, didn't fade or shrink.  The material is bit hot to wear, but they were a good buy for the money."
4.0,Sizes a little small
4.0,"The short reach just above mid thigh. They are not too short like I expected. They fit true to size. There is no zipper. The waistband is wide and stretchy. There are 2 side pockets and two back pockets. It's decently stitched. Some of the paste gems are glued and I can see glue bubble on the edges but only at a close look. When my daughter walks I can't see any defects in them. The faux pearls seem to be attached with small metal pins. I hope they hold under wash. Fabric is %100 cotton. They are a bit loose where the zipper is supposed to be, so they do not confine her movements. Perfect stylish shorts for summer months."
4.0,What do you want for twenty bucks for two pairs of glasses!
4.0,"Got this in XL. My husband is 6'1 and 180lbs and it fits perfect. He usually has trouble finding shirts where the sleeves are long enough and Coofandy's shirts do not disappoint. The shirt is thick and of good quality, awesome color too. Will be buying again."
4.0,"A little thick,  but works well."
4.0,"little smaller than expected, despite using the size chart"
4.0,"This is another nice charm from Gnoce, very detailed. Gave four stars because the actual color is more salmon pink and not the pink depicted in the ad. Also the CZs don’t sparkle like in the ad but I still like it. The legs of the flamingo do catch on things so must be careful when it’s sweater season."
4.0,Fits weird and snags easily but still looks great!
4.0,I purchased these ear rings for my 6 year old daughter.  She has lost many pairs in the pool and I wanted hoops that would lock closed and not break easily.  She loves them but they are a little big for her little head.  She hasn't taken them out since the day she got them and so far they've been great.
4.0,Take pressure off of tightness of glasses.
4.0,Works well but causes bacteria build up if not washed regularly
4.0,The costume is nice. Fits true to size. The only thing I didn't like is that the hat is all pushed in from the packaging. Othe than that every thing is good.
4.0,The charm is small but perfect for my 4 year old granddaughter. She loves it and hasn’t taken it off .
4.0,"Love this dress! It is great quality material! Very comfortable and stretchy. It hangs nicely and is faltering. I did deduct a star because the belt it came with is a bit tight. I am hoping it will stretch out with wear, but it is certainly not a 2X belt."
4.0,"I love this top, it ended up surprising me, it fits nicely and I wear it with a tank top underneath  b/c it is a bit sheer. Otherwise it is flattering and I am very happy with it."
4.0,Very delicate.  A lovely present for my 15 yr old granddaughter; she will be thrilled with it.
4.0,Mother in-law is a dog lover and she Frye’s when she got these.  Thank you so much for bringing her heart so much joy from a pair of socks but who doesn’t love their fur babies especially after their kids are all grown great stocking stuffer thanks again.
4.0,I've been wearing these for three or four days out of the work week for several weeks now. Pretty comfortable. The laces stay tied. At the price point it's a decent piece of Footwear. Not Timberlands but nowhere near the price.
4.0,Didn't realize was a halter top. Ordered a 3x and it runs small
4.0,"The head gloves are exactly as expected!<br />They each fit a bit different from each other, but this is a very minor issue.<br /><br />The glove looks nice, it fits nice, fells soft and comfortable and keeps you hands protected from the weather!<br /><br />These gloves look exactly as the photo shows. All 3 pairs were included and appear to be in nice quality condition. My daughter picked out these gloves and has been very pleased with her purchase.<br /><br />I would absolutely recommend these to anyone looking for a cute pair of fashion gloves!"
4.0,"Nice and warm, but leaves little gray fuzzies all over my shirt.  I tried washing the jacket to see if it would help, but it didn't.  Still a nice jacket to wear to work though.  Just be careful if you're wearing it with a black shirt.  It will show all the fuzzies."
4.0,Hecka see throught.
4.0,Good for going to and from pool.
4.0,Cute and fit well.I'm 5'4&#34; 100 lbs. and ordered small.
4.0,Though this looks nice my glasses rail will not slide all the way onto the loop and my glasses are very thin
4.0,This dress was super cute. It looked great on but the issue is the sleeves are too small.
4.0,"We bought this to give our teenage daughter, she loved it!"
4.0,Just what I want!
4.0,"They don't ride up, and help keep you dry."
4.0,I’m 5 foot 7 and 160 pounds and I bought a medium. The fit isn’t tight but it does show my curves. I love the length. It hit right above my knee. The fabric feels cheap & smells awful right out of the package but it’s not see-through and nothing a wash can’t fix. I just bought 2 more. Perfect for work.
4.0,I really enjoy these!
4.0,"This was a gift, but it was a bit large."
4.0,Very pretty. Small and dainty. Very elegant looking.
4.0,"Like the fact you could personalized your own, but cases are not firmed to provide protection for squeezing in order for  glasses or sunglasses not to break while in the case. I had to buy cases to fit inside to make it more firmer in order to protect glasses or sunglasses in order from squeezing  / smashing to withstand handling while hanging on belt loop or outer bags."
4.0,"La sudadera con capucha me quedó bien, esta de acuerdo a su talle y es muy cómodo. Lo único que me molesta y deberían mejorar es la mala calidad del cierre. Tiene los bordes o dientes ásperos y se enganchan con la tela cuando la prenda se lleva abierta."
4.0,"They run pretty big and may be sloppy for those with small feet, but are a really cool gift idea!"
4.0,"I'm giving 4 stars because I absolutely LOVE the color and the swiss dot material...but as other reviewers have said - it's poofy. I looove pockets, but I have to say, they don't work on this particular skirt. They sit right on the hip which causes the fabric to poof out and make you look much wider than reality. You can also see the pocket outline and anything you put in the pockets since the outer layer is slight sheer. Not a good fit for me personally, but I do think the quality of the lining and material is beautiful for the price. If you are very thin, this might work great for you. For reference, I'm 5'9"", 160 lbs, 34D, and my waist is about 30-31"" and I ordered the medium."
4.0,"Touch screen is not perfect, but not bad either."
4.0,I had to put a stitch in the plunging neckline because it is PLUNGING. it’s a little more sheer than I thought it’s be but I think it’s okay. It’s cute.
4.0,Nice quality...just a bit shorter than expected.
4.0,"I did not like the style after I put it on, so I returned it."
4.0,"pretty happy so far, should float, but have not tested that.  Overall the price is decent and they shipped fast"
4.0,Color is as pictured (purple).  Looks very nice.  The size is fine for the recipient (10 year old).  May be too small for someone with a larger head.
4.0,I never order dresses online.  I was pleased with the fit of this dress. I am 5ft 2 but ordered the medium
4.0,"Sizing was not quite as anticipated (despite reading the chart carefully), so I gave it to a friend. Other than that, it's apparently pretty comfy and wears well."
4.0,"For the price, does the trick.  Not Tilley but good!"
4.0,"Talk about bright, cheery hoodies! This Santa hoodie is the best! The colors are so cheerful, and the design is adorable! The quality is good, too.<br /><br />This is not a thick, cozy hoodie. It is a thinner material, which is perfect for my son who gets hot easily. I do think it runs a tad small. My son is 5' 8"" and about 130 pounds, and he usually wears a small. This medium fits him well.<br /><br />He has complained about the cuffs being a little too snug (and he has small arms and wrists). He likes to push up his sleeves, but he can't, because of this. But, overall, great hoodie!"
4.0,Work well!  Inexpensive but impressive!
4.0,This hat is pretty and protects well from the sun. But it also catches the wind and will fly off. It's adjustable in the back so be sure you have it tight enough. I do recommend it.
4.0,Not as dark as pictured but still a deep blue
4.0,Good price for 2. Leather is a little cheap
4.0,I love the design but it was too big I should have got a smaller size will be mailing back to exchange for a smaller size
4.0,"I really liked the fabric, soft and not too thin/not too heavy. The neckline and sleeves were also as pictured. It fit well all around, but it was a tad short for my liking. The length is really hard to gauge when all the pictures show the shirt tucked in. I have a relatively short torso and it hit just below where my belt is on my pants, which I'm sure for some is perfect for a t-shirt. I just like my shirts a little longer so that I'm still covered if I lift my arms up. Overall a good buy, just not the length I was looking for."
4.0,"These worked well for the most part - a few duds in the box.  Kids liked them at our holiday party, but they are a bit like having tiny colored flashlights on your fingers.  The other flashing jewelry was more popular."
4.0,A few reviews said to order a size up.  I don't agree.  I think they fit as they should.<br />I like these.  They aren't too thin.  They seem to keep their shape and wash well.
4.0,This top is very pretty! It does run a little large though. You can definitely order on size down. The color is just like in the picture and the quality is great. I do own several pieces from NINEXIS and I have never been disappointed with their quality.<br />I can definitely recommend this shirt!<br />I received it at a disocunted price for an honest and unbiased review.
4.0,It is a bit large for my D - but she wore it. Tied the top higher around the neckline.  Material is thin - so best for warm weather. Cute dress!
4.0,"Cute and soft, but a little tighter than expected."
4.0,The bag looks great. I can't complain about it. The only thing is that the one I got the zipper is not working good. But the bag is a very beautiful bag.
4.0,"These run true to size & support your breasts as you run or whatever you do. It is a warm material and makes me sweat more on my chest, but aren’t they all like that?  It has removable pads in the breasts, and these make it hotter to wear, but without the pads, you can see through it, so, these are good for sports or everyday support and stay in the right place when you move around."
4.0,Somewhat small around my calf area but I am still enjoying wearing them!!
4.0,"I really like this dress. I’m 5’8” and I weigh 176 pounds. I ordered an extra large but I could have gotten a large. The length is perfect, the colors are vibrant and the material is cool with me.  I didn’t realize that the dress had pockets when I ordered it so I was pleasantly surprised when I realized it has them. The dress is a little big on me but all and all it’s a very nice dress."
4.0,Very colorful assortment great investment for anyone who wears suits regularly.
4.0,hard to read
4.0,It took a little longer to get but it was worth it because it is a better quality face mask and a filter was even included !
4.0,"This is cute.  I bought it for my daughter to were to anime con.  We were glad to find something that would work for the look she was going for.  The only issue we had with it was tight in the shoulders and difficult to get on.  My daughter also said it was hot.  It is well made and like I said it's cute.  My daughter looked great in it, of course she looks good in everything, she is a pretty girl.  She plans on wearing it again and not as a costume."
4.0,"The waist fits as expected, but the pouch is too small."
4.0,Son muy lindas solo corren un poquito grande y no me gusto son muy largas
4.0,Home
4.0,"Color is a bit off, but nice."
4.0,"Too saggy for my liking, but still a real cute hat!"
4.0,"Good size, fit; functional...  Was expecting an embroidered logo, but it's printed on.  Was a reasonable price tho, and a good piece of memorabilia, so I'm keeping it."
4.0,Quality is okay for the price. The fabric has a decent amount of stretch. I ordered the small and I'm usually small - medium in these fit n flare style dresses. It is however VERY low cut. Aggressively low cut even. I'm not sure if I'll be able to wear it but if I do it will require a lot of tape or a cami underneath.
4.0,"Maintenance staff like using these gloves for all their work, swimming pools, plumbing etc.  AND they are washable!"
4.0,Nice wallet. Arrived one day late.
4.0,Real comfortable sweatshirt but arms are very baggy.
4.0,The seller was great in getting this product to me but the xl that I ordered barely gets around my wrist and the edges snag everything
4.0,I bought these for my two year old and they are great! Easy to slip on and seem to be comfortable for her and durable as well. I'm very satisfied and am considering buying the next size up as she grows.
4.0,I hope to use in the snow
4.0,"It is a beautiful dress made with heavy material. I love it! EXCEPT I had to get the chest altered. I ordered a medium and am a 36 D/5’3”/128. It was STILL to large at the top. Unless you are a DD+, you should get a small or plan on having it altered."
4.0,"This is very soft and made of high-quality materials.  The color is nice and very similar to the picture. The pads are very thick but they are removable.<br /><br />I think it is just like a medium impact sports bra but it looks good. The bra is too small. Size up if you want to buy this. I usually buy size small (I'm 34C cup) and it was too small for me. But other than size, it seems a good sports bra."
4.0,Because it's junior sized I expected it have shorter sleeves which was the case. If they could have been about 3 inches longer in the sleeves it would have been perfect. I may also have to wash it pre-use to get the awful chemical smell off it. I have to say I got a headache after trying it on maybe 3 times. I'm very sensitive to odors and they give me migraines. That would be my only complaint. It's very well made I love the color and the warmth it's long enough on my short frame. I'm 5' 4&#34; I wear size 18 clothes this fit me just fine with still quite a bit of room. I could have sized down but I prefer my coats a little loose.
4.0,I like this dress. It's pretty basic but that's what's I was looking for. The sewing is a bit mediocre but for the price it's good and it will do.
4.0,Very clear vision with these. The price is good for  the quality but they are a little tricky to get centered properly.
4.0,Just as shown- fast shipping and looks great. Came with a nice case.
4.0,"Nice surprise!  I was a little skeptical about buying this after so many previous items ordered from other sellers proved to be too good to be true.  However, the quality was great, as was the color and sizing.  The blue color combo is as it was pictured, which was another plus tto this purchase.  I am typically a women’s medium, and this fit as I had hoped.  I’m looking forward to the next occasion when I can wear this."
4.0,Not very comfort runs small
4.0,"It took one week to deliver, but the quality is good."
4.0,"I'd recommend purchasing 1 size larger for length purposes, other than that love the shirt!!!"
4.0,The inseam was about an inch larger than I'd like. Overall quality is great.
4.0,These socks are great at keeping your feet warm but not hot! There are just the right thickness BUT they are too short! Your feet stay warm but your lower leg gets cold-would love to have them a bit longer!
4.0,"In my opinion they are not satisfactorily insulated to keep your hands comfortably warm below 55ºF, The &#34;large size&#34; runs somewhat small, but I liked the overall quality so well, I ordered a second pair in XL, and passed the L on to my son-in-law. I would suggest that if your hand measures even CLOSE to the next size up, GO FOR THE NEXT SIZE UP! This is the sizing chart, which can be found at the bottom of &#34;Product Description:<br />SIZE:<br />M:7.5 - 8.3Inch (19CM -21CM)<br />L: 8.3 - 9.5 Inch (21CM -24CM)<br />XL: 9.5 -10.3 Inch (24 CM -26 CM<br />Due to manual measurement, allows 1-3(cm) discrepancy. (3cm=1.2&#34;)"
4.0,This product was great for the price. Fit perfectly.
4.0,Real nice watch for the price  we'll see how it last.
4.0,Beautiful pendant. Love it. Arrived just as ordered. Chain had a kink in two places but I loved the pendant so much that I will find a chain.
4.0,"Neat visor. The velcro bands make it adjustable. The wide brim does keep the sun out but it takes some getting used to  if like me, you wear vision correction glasses. The fact that it's not a full head hat means you're not sweating under a hat but you still need to stay out of direct sunlight. Quality wise, it's above average but I'm not sure how lasting it might be. Will take wearing it through a complete season to know for sure. Also I have a smaller head than typical, so that meant it had to be angled upwards so I could see through my glasses and also keep it in place."
4.0,Very pretty. Got them as a gift for my daughter. She really likes them.
4.0,"It's a little heavy for long-term use, but it is pretty to wear for a few hours at a time"
4.0,Very nice! Really dressed up my outfit for a special party. The perfect finishing touch.
4.0,It is small and flat
4.0,"Very effective as an inner layer for lighter coats in winter.  It fits tightly, so buying a large size will only make the waist and arms longer."
4.0,"I was hoping for a cute, boho-type thing to throw on over a tank since I'm not a beach-goer, but this is just way to big for me. I'm five feet nothing, neither skinny nor chubby, but I've tried and just can't make this thing work. The lace on the hem is okay, but I really don't know how well it'll wear. The material has a nice feel to it and it is cute, but I do feel it's overpriced as well. Overall, if you're on the smaller side, I'd pass."
4.0,"Way bigger than expected, but absolutely beautiful! Will have to get better fitting backs before wearing these heavy earrings to be sure they don’t fall out."
4.0,The ponytail hole!  Awesome!!!!
4.0,It looks thick in the picture but it's not. It's see through and it's like petite. I gave it four star because of the price.
4.0,"These were purchased as a bday gift for a nephew who is an avid gamer.  They are very sporty looking, have nosepads (which is a plus), and you can see that they've definitely got the AR coating on the lenses which will help with the glare from the tv/computer screen/telephone screen.  They lenses also have a slight grey tint which I believe is the bluelight blocker that is built into the lens.  They came with a hard case plus a cleaning cloth (which will be great to maintain the AR coating).  The quality seems to be good for the price, and they did arrive 1 day ahead of schedule."
4.0,It has a pony tail hole :)
4.0,This shirt is made of very thin material and therefore quite clingy once on.  Not going to be for me.
4.0,"I like everything about this bag, tons of pockets, I can fit two iPad Pro 11s. I would like an all black model w/o a logo."
4.0,"My girlfriend loves extra large shirts to sleep in at night. She loves Disney and I love the giants, couldn’t resist getting her this shirt"
4.0,They were a little smaller than I expected but they were very beautiful!
4.0,"I needed something to wear with my Orthoheels flipflops. These fit well. I have a &#34;Morton&#34; foot, so the toes are almost too short."
4.0,"The product is good, arrived in good time and the person who it was purchased for loves it!"
4.0,Looks amazing and fits great. Having a problem with the zipper in back. It’s stuck half way others would give 5 stars!!!
4.0,"I don't like the stripe print as much, it's not a bold stripe at all."
4.0,"I lost the crown on my good watch and had to send it in for repairs. The batteries were dead on every single one of my old watches. I hate being watchless, so I bought this self-winding watch. The style is so ugly! Large dial and thin, thin band. The inside gold immediately sweated off. I got my good watch back now and I have to say this watch kept very good time, and I expect it to be ready again for use as a back-up if needed."
4.0,"Much like the actual RBG, this mask is awesome! The mask is small and covers only what it needs to most protect, much like RBG! The only issue with the mask is that it’s hotter than most, not ideal for the hot-header preservationist of human rights..."
4.0,"Bought this for my boyfriend,  I really like it.  Great wallet"
4.0,I liked them ok. The. weintree I bought  I liked a lot better
4.0,I have been looking for the perfect Girls night out dress and I think I've found the one. It fits perfect just a tad loose in the bust area on the sides. I am in love with the wine color and how it falls into the split in the front. Can't wait till my girls night out adventure in it next month!
4.0,I absolutely loved my costume but the only problem I had was that the dress was way too large. I’m normally a size medium but saw that measurements are different in China so I did my exact measurements. I was apparently an XL in China so I ordered that size. The dress came in right in time for Halloween but it was very large & fell off of my shoulders. I still love the dress though
4.0,"I bought the small size. They're snug in the foot, but not too much. They're also too long in the shaft for my rain boots, but not enough to be a problem. Seem warm and cozy."
4.0,As with any grommet belt you can't bend the fabric where the hardware is. These grommets have a thin borders making them prone to releasing from the canvas they are on. No wardrobe malfunction yet after 4 weeks but I can see they are not going to last without treating them with a lot of care. I will consider a different buckling system next time.
4.0,"I normally order a large for shirts, so I ordered large. Im a C36, I should have ordered a medium for a more firm and tight fit. Over all its a nice top though; material and looks."
4.0,Nice color and feel.
4.0,"Keeps shirt in place!  But, you have to look for the sweet spot in terms of how loose or tight the holder should be for your body type.  I was frustrated at first because the holder would move up and will be seen after sitting and standing up a few times.  I loosened the garter and now it stays at a level where I want it to be."
4.0,Good price - looks horrible on me
4.0,"Neat watch! I can't review on the actual function of the product because I bought this as a gift, but I can say that the colors (for me at least) were not rainbow and only consisted of neon green and pink. Either way, it's pretty and I'd personally wear it."
4.0,These area great! They really do keep your feet from sliding around.
4.0,They do what I expected and seem a little more sturdy than the original.  I don't think you will be disappointed.
4.0,I love the shirt but I should have gotten a 2x instead of a 3x. But I wanted to make sure the shirt fit alittle of the reviews said the shirt ran small but it doesnt.
4.0,"They are a little bulky and fit my son a little big, but I think it's because of how bulky they are. They are really cute and he likes them. They keep his feet warm. They do look just like the picture which is nice."
4.0,"I love this dress!  My only issue is that the &#34;white&#34; is not a true white, it's an off-white or vanilla color.  For this reason, it will go back.  I love how it fit but it is not the color I wanted... It's very stretchy, kind of thick, but comfortable. Sad that it will be returned."
4.0,"Very nice dress , size was right on got the Large, for reference im 5 '3 and falls at ankle, happy with this purchase."
4.0,Cute and fit well. Arrived quickly and was packaged well.
4.0,"This cap doesn't have any adjustment on it. The heat is stretchy so that is a plus. This is a thin hat to wear in the fall, summer or spring are probly the best months. Seems to thin to wear in winter."
4.0,Doesn't last long but it's comfortable
4.0,"Gorgeous and unique design but Ill-tailored with a too-high empire waist that accommodates for no bust, and sleeves that are tight yet breathable."
4.0,"Shipping took a bit of patience, but once the product arrived I was very pleased. The charm is actually a bit bigger than the picture, but it doesn't bother me at all."
4.0,got the three flags that are awesome but I didn't get the hand of the king brooch
4.0,"Wounderful shoes, however the soles are a little more tough and firm than we expected. Otherwise great."
4.0,This shirt runs small.  It is very soft and comfortable
4.0,"Delicate and pretty.  This necklace is refined, yet trendy. A good purchase for the price."
4.0,Color alittle off from picture
4.0,The inside panels are white not clear like the picture. Feels weird but does what it's suppose to. Get what you pay for
4.0,These are perfect! Exactly what I ordered and the glossy finish is done well. Can't wait to rock these!
4.0,Order a size smaller
4.0,Did not want to buy new bras for an inch. These extenders worked well
4.0,Nice shaping
4.0,I gave them as a gift to one of my  classmates. She loves them!
4.0,Bought for my 23yr old son. Fit nicely.
4.0,FotL boxer briefs are good underwear and last even through the treatment I give them.
4.0,I like the fabric and also they are longer and stay tucked in.  One of the plastic loops on the straps broke.  Easy fix but annoying and the reason they aren't 5 stars
4.0,"These are a great set although they use hard fealt fabric for the masks which can be very uncomfortable and felt scratchy on faces, would have been much better of they used the same fabric as the capes themselves for the masks"
4.0,this glass is truly light weight<br />designer glass look<br />i love the case<br />Big enough to give protection
4.0,Great price and was the only bowtie I could find to match the very specific bridesmaid dress I need to pair with.
4.0,Sunglasses are a great style and quality. My son is currently 3 months and he will not fit into them until he is 1.
4.0,Too small but my sister loves them!
4.0,Very comfortable! Size is as expected. I like that it has a specific left and right foot.
4.0,"Bought this for travel, since I can't pack my regular body pillow.  Worked generally well, once we figured out how to inflate it.  There were no instructions for inflating included in the package.  It definitely helped, although next time I use it, I'll add a pillow case.  Glad to have it when I fly to visit family next week!"
4.0,I liked the assorted colors.
4.0,"This is my second one,  the first time i ordered  M  and it was so small looks like S but in tag says M, I decide to order the M again ,in this  second one arrived perfect , I’m 5.5 tall 1.65  33 waist"
4.0,"This fits fairly well, and has some good support, as well as being cute with the straps at the back."
4.0,"It's a nice purse and holds a lot of stuff. I had to buy a purse organizer, though because it doesn't have separate pockets."
4.0,"Purchased these for a monster truck rally. You can still hear everything happening around you, but it certainly cuts the sound significantly."
4.0,These boots are super stylish and can go great with most of my outfits. My one complaint would probably be that I wish this were real leather and not Pleather ;P
4.0,Love the color and it serves its purpose.  No quite long enough in the back for what I was hoping to use it for but until I find one that will work for my needs it works like a charm.  A waterproof charm.
4.0,"This is my second pair of this brand of PJ's.  The first pair I ordered was so silky soft and comfy that I decided to order this pair.  Unfortunately these are not quite as comfortable as the first and are bit more snug.  Both pairs of PJ's are the same size but for some reason (maybe the material) these are a tad smaller feeling.  I really do like these but would have loved them if they fit and felt like the first pair.  Oh well, live and learn!"
4.0,"A thicker material and a bit heavy. They seem to have ran small and the elastic is tight. The waistband on the pants, the elastic just flips in there and always needs straightening. Smelled like pickles when it arrived, after washing there was no smell. Washed well."
4.0,Look just like the picture.  Nice size and quality.  Totally love these!
4.0,Will get more just Larger size!
4.0,Nothing yet to long
4.0,"Super cute skirt, it's pretty snug on me, though. Wish it came on XL"
4.0,Nice basic sock. Runs a little big but soft and comfy.
4.0,"Cute and casual. Great for lounging or running errands. My daughter wears a small, so that’s what I ordered. The waist doesn’t have a lot of stretch, and they just fit her. No room to grow really, but fit well for now. For reference, She’s 5’2”, 110lbs."
4.0,I like this product. I don’t use it often only when The silicone band would not be appropriate. I would recommend this
4.0,"Works great for rubber-to-rubber bonding, not very well for rubber-to-canvas bonding.  Still trying to find a glue that will do that."
4.0,Emma loved these my four year old they do get messed up fast if used at school often
4.0,Nice but run a little larger
4.0,Hermosa. Es justo cómo se ve en la foto.
4.0,I ORDERED THIS FOR MY GRANDAUGHTER AND IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN A LITTLE TOO BIG BUT IF FITTED PERFECTLY AND SHE WILL PROBABLE BE OUT OF IT PRETTY SOON.  THE QUALITY OF THE MATERIALS LOOKS GOOD THOUGH AND WILL SEE WHAT HAPPENS WHEN IT GETS WASHED FOR THE FIRST TIME
4.0,The mask is very comfortable but I wish it was more snug. The large size is too big. Great design.
4.0,"Nice slippers, but had to return them as they ran very small"
4.0,"I really love this watch it's very beautiful it's clear to see what time it is now but when I was running it happened to hop out of my pocket and the chain broke when the length ended due to the momentum, my point being I wish the chain was tougher"
4.0,"Absolutely beautiful set, but they run very small.  I wish I had ordered next larger size.  Will probably order again, in higher size.  Love the color and texture"
4.0,"It ran small for me. I’m a true medium and the medium I purchased was a snug shoulder-span across my back. My span is 16” and it was tight if I crossed my arms in front. As you can see, I have a sweater on underneath but it’s even tight on with just a tee on. In any event...<br /><br />My intention was to return the medium and get the large. Well, I put in for the return ($24.99 plus free shipping) and then when I went to purchase the Large, it’s $50 inclusive of the shipping. What the what???<br />Seller really disappointed me with this one. Booooo!<br />For reference, I’m 5’8”"
4.0,So soft but leaves lint all over everything I wear.
4.0,"I love the colors, the material, and Value for your money. However, what I dislike is the ankles, they’re so small and difficult to get off."
4.0,"I would totally give this five stars because the product is AWESOME, however I was shorted one. I only received 9 instead of 10."
4.0,"Plugs look great and have a good finish( i.e. no green ears!!), have been able to wear all day with only very slight discomfort.  Only complaint I would have is the set I received had a very weak magnetic field,  a day in my freezer with some Lab magnets I had fixed that though."
4.0,Had a slight dent. It's a darker silver. Not bad. Chain a bit long though.
4.0,A little uncomfortable without socks but overall better than the sliders sold in stores.
4.0,Cute one!!
4.0,"A little small in the bust area. i wear a little stretch under it, and leave a couple of buttons open. I still love it though. Great for round the house and running errands. I just wash and hang dry. I don't put it in the dryer. i don't put many clothes in dryer."
4.0,"The fabric is fairly sheer. The white was placed over my light blue dress and you could clearly see the hemline, but viewers across the room stated that it still protects people from seeing your underwear if wearing a skirt that doesn't cover your knees! We're alright with this one. It passes the church test!"
4.0,"The seller customer service is wonderful! I received prompt, polite, and very helpful communications. This got lost in the USPS for a few months and when the seller was unable to locate it they refunded me. It finally arrived about 3 months after my purchase so I notified the seller so I could make payment. They gave it to me for free instead.<br /><br />Quality is fine. I wish the fit was looser. The fabric is what I'd call a jersey knit, which is not my favorite. The pocket openings don't lie flat but that could just be on my body. 5 stars for sheerness means not sheer but mine is in black so that's as expected. It is a thin fabric - nice and cool in summer."
4.0,Quality isn't great but it's cute enough I wear it under v neck t shirts and get a lot of compliments
4.0,I originally bought them for my 9 year old but they were too big so I gave them to my very slender 13 year old and they fit him.
4.0,"My husband and I both love this Balaclava!  It is made of very soft fleece and is surprisingly thicker than I thought it would be.  It's actually thicker than the store bought one my husband had been using.  It fits my husband well with room to spare and, because of the pull strings that make it adjustable, it fits me as well.  It covers your entire face and neck, but I do wish the forehead flap would come down a little bit further because it seems to inch its way up sometimes leaving my forehead a bit exposed. But I just pull it back down again to adjust it.  I also like that the mouth flap can be pulled down if needed.  This will be perfect for the snowy New Jersey winter they are calling for, especially for my husband who plows for extra money. It arrived to us quickly with Prime shipping (oh how I love Prime shipping!)  All-in-all, this is a product I would definitely recommend.<br /><br />I received this item at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review."
4.0,Actually pretty easy to do the size and nice band for the price.
4.0,"Cute, but a little short for an older woman"
4.0,"This works well and does keep you warm.  The battery could last longer, but it still works great.  Something that is not mentioned is the battery has a built in safety so if it is shut off for more than 30 seconds, the battery has to be powered on before the vest will turn on."
4.0,"In general, I like it. The quality is as expected. Size is true."
4.0,A little bit bigger than our says so you gotta buy it 1 size less than you used to Wear
4.0,I bought it for my granddaughter. She love it and wear it most of time. I'm wondering if more colors selections should be better. It's easy to get very dirty.
4.0,I think it's 100% perfect. I saw on the reviews that people weren't happy with how it looks after wash but I haven't gotten that far yet. I like that the tie is long enough to bring to the front and make a bow. It's very long.
4.0,Bunny ears and bow tie and cuffs were great and lasted through 2 parties. Tail was too small for Bunny girl 1950s style I was going for and ended up ordering another bunny tail.
4.0,"Very cute, fits great- runs a bit large"
4.0,It's comfortable and shapely. I like the way it looks but cup size could be bigger . I think cup Sizes run smaller than they used to. Ive worn  a 32-34DD for 30 years and All of a sudden I need to buy 32-34FFF-H??? I haven't gained weight and my boobs are not any bigger so go figure
4.0,Its a little thin so need to wear a tank underneath.  The fit and color were true.  I think it would look better with silver buttons instead of gold.  this a perfect summer tank for casual that you can wear with shorts and can be made to look dressy and wear with a skirt.  I want to get them in all colors!
4.0,"Fits pretty well. Unfortunately the design on the side pocket (in the picture provided) was broken before it arrived to me, I'll just remove it.. The leg holes are a little tight. The zipper isn't all that great, may replace it."
4.0,Love the cool and the structure but I just wish they took better care to send it so nothing has a crease or slight dent in it. It's obviously no Michael Kors but I'm happy with it anyway.
4.0,I did like this item. Just not the color I was hoping for.
4.0,This was a gift for our son who graduated from Georgia Tech. He love the hat
4.0,"Pros:<br />Flattering design; looser than leggings or tights, soft; pockets (only in front), looks like material that will resist pilling; nice dark black; true to size; great for knocking around or wearing over workout clothes (as long as you don't mind being chilly to/from gym in the winter..  if you live where it gets cold)<br /><br />Cons:<br />-Thin, slick material (just a personal preference, I prefer thicker, more cottony/spandex material)<br />-b/c of thin material, maybe not ideal for working out<br />-As to wearing jogging..  The thin material = too cold to wear jogging in winter (assuming you live where it gets cold), and don't need long pants to jog in summer..<br />(As an aside, if you prefer long hiking pants/hike in nice weather, these would be fine.  If you hike in wooded areas, it remains to be seen if the material is durable enough to withstand what could be snagging from branches, etc.)<br />-Definitely a misuse of the word sweatpants, in the ad, that are typically thicker cottony material, often fleece-lined<br />-Could be a bit longer in length (I'm only 5' 6 1/2"" and the cuffs are above my ankles)<br />-The ""seam"" of the waistband shows under thinner tops (needs to be flatter/smoother to not show)<br /><br />If you want a comfortable, flattering, thin, knock-around, everyday pant, this is a great choice.  Highly recommend.<br /><br />If you're looking for something that is squat-proof, and thick enough to be comfy wearing in colder weather, you may want to ""try"" to find something thicker.  (I ordered several 'joggers' hoping to find thicker material but they were ALL made of the same thin, slick material.)"
4.0,I have a very small foot (5) so they are a little big.
4.0,I was pleased with this product. You have to try a couple times to get correct placement but it does its job. It does not lift but does give cleavage. I wore mine on our vacation at the beach and it stayed in place the whole night.
4.0,"My skin got really irritated from wearing this watch but I feel it was probably my fault however if your skin gets irritated from wearing it then I know it wasn’t my fault however, the watch itself was actually pretty good. I liked it."
4.0,"Awesome I use it to walk, while work, or when I clean the house and its comfortable"
4.0,The color and fit is perfect. The buttons are sewn on a little loose so I’m anticipating they’re going to fall off. They keep my hands warm. Wish they were softer.
4.0,If your child is in between sizes go up a size. This dress fits small/true to size. My daughter is very slim so it worked for her. This dress is beautiful.
4.0,nice quality and came in a really nice hard case to protect them when not in use. the detachable head strap is a great feature. they are very bulky and stick out away from your face a lot. they almost don't fit under my ski helmet.
4.0,The hole where you are supposed to put a chain is very small. It was very difficult to find a chain to fit this locket.
4.0,It was very big on me so didn’t see the beauty of the dress
4.0,good set
4.0,I am using this hat mainly for out fishing! I love it’s lightweight and it does its job well!
4.0,"I didn't realize how long it was going to be. Thought it would be shorter around my neck, but it hangs below t-shirt neck level about 2 inches. Don't know the exact length because I didn't measure it. But I will still be wearing this. Very beautiful. :)"
4.0,Cute Earrings
4.0,"Great shirt, dry clean only so it the cool looking cami pattern doesn’t fade, but unless you have a toothpick thin body completely devoid of any muscle mass whatsoever, order a size bigger than you normally wear. I’m 5’6, 150 and physically fit but definitely not bulky. I initially ordered my usual medium… I looked like a stuffed sausage; had to return it for a large then have the length shortened by a tailor…. worth it though, it’s one of my favorite shirts."
4.0,It’s a pretty dress for the price. I had to work with it a little to get a flatting look for my round figure. I’m 4’11” about 175. I can wear this out or to work. It looks cute with leggings too. I got it in 2X because of my mid section. If I had a flat tummy I would have gotten 1x.
4.0,Just a bit tight in the under arm and chest area.  Best for 32” bust and under.  A larger size for me would be too long.  Did not return will wear around the house.  Price is right
4.0,Served its purpose for my Toga attire. Cute.
4.0,fabric is light weight and comfortable. generous fit worth the money
4.0,good cap
4.0,I think they run a bit too big but I do like them
4.0,"Harry Potter gift, hope they like it.."
4.0,Nice cross earrings
4.0,Great and beautiful skirt I love it . The material is good quality. Can't wait for my photo shoot with this skirt on spring time.
4.0,"Lovely silver Hi-tops, and the LED lights are spot on...but there were NO instructions on how to charge them up or how to use the lights"
4.0,Good protection from the sun however a little hard to attach. May get easier with more use.
4.0,Socks work great for my sister to use during her yoga classes
4.0,Nice but wished it where a bit larger.
4.0,happy with this!
4.0,The material and design of this dress is great! Perfect for the office!
4.0,Ordered a small and the top fit great but I have a butt and thighs so the bottoms were tight. But overall I great bathing suit!
4.0,I'm 5'7&#34; and about 145lbs and a size large fit me very well. I had to get a backless/strapless bra and a pair of spanx to wear it but for the price that's worth it. The material is a bit heavy but not so much that you feel like it is weighing you down. I probably couldn't wear heels with it because then the front would look too short but flats should look good.
4.0,That it fits but I though it wouldn't be so thin
4.0,"Definitely fits as expected so don’t be afraid to get your size. (Size small, 5’4’’ for reference) The ruffles throughout are super cute as well.<br />It has pockets so that’s always a plus!<br />The material is on the light, see-through side just so you know.<br />Be sure to keep it ironed as it did wrinkle easily after sitting for a while before taking these pictures.<br /><br />For a $30 dress, I was expecting a bit more thickness. but overall, It’ll be a part of my wardrobe.<br />I give it 4 stars!"
4.0,"The color and fit were as expected!  The fabric was thinner than I thought it would be, so I returned it.  I have too many lumps and bumps for material this thin and don’t want to wear many layers under to smooth everything out in hot south Florida.  Will look back and see if there are patterns I like in this dress - patterns hide lots of body “flaws”."
4.0,"the top one did not fit, but the bottom one fit very well and i love it. also very easy to form to your mouth."
4.0,"I bought this for a wedding and it looks great! The material is a little thicker than expected but that's ok. It will definitely need some ironing or tossed in the dryer but I really like it! The top does fit a little snug but it keeps everything in place. Also, it doesn't show too much cleavage so that was a plus for me."
4.0,bought it for my wife.  the flowers are a little bigger than expected but overall great for the price
4.0,Bought for a friend & looks really pretty on her.  Slightly darker pink than expected.  The lace is kind of more like embroidered.  Fit as expected.
4.0,"great looking cap.  fits a little tightly - there's elastic band in the back, which also makes wearing the hat backwards look awkward"
4.0,"Good product, sized small"
4.0,"Inexpensive, get what you pay for. But my grand daughter was happy with it"
4.0,Had issues with the umbrella able to get it fixed due to great customer service! Nicely built and well made umbrella!
4.0,"This is a beautiful little organizer for a backpack with lots of pockets and zippers, but.....this does not fit your standard Loungefly mini-backpack."
4.0,"Wore this to a Renaissance Faire and dressed it up like a high elf.  Material is not great, but it was light enough on a VERY hot day, and looked super cute.  I saw 2 others in the same dress."
4.0,"This is the third Lily Bloom handbag I have purchased.  I loved my Landopn handbag but wish it had been a crossbody bag as I have a hard time with bags that are not.  I love my Libby crossbody bag, but wish  it had as many pockets as the Landon!  I still have my Landon bag and will use it again.  So far, I am pleased with my Libby handbag.  Thank you, Lily Bloom for making such fun and versatile bags!"
4.0,"This swimsuit fit correctly, but isn't super comfortable. The material is thicker than I thought. Keeping it because it fits well. Looks nice on, and since its a Speedo it should hold up to multiple washings."
4.0,"I am 5ft 11 inches tall and a size 12-14. I usually wear size L in women's and size XL in juniors. I bought the size 5x of this hoodie based on the reviews and it fits wonderfully. I  have broad shoulders and a wide rib cage w/ 34D bra size. This sweatshirt fit around me without issue and has a little extra room when zipped up. The white lining is a very thin soft material, but still pretty. Overall, I would say the quality is on par with Forever 21 or H&M."
4.0,"I like the wallet but it is a little stiff and because of that, it is difficult to get the credit cards out.  I would like it just a little larger so it is not so tight a space for credit cards.  It snaps closed nicely.  And I love the color.  It arrived with a big black mark on it, but I used leather cleaner and with a few rubs, the mark came off.  I would give this 5 stars if it was a little softer and easier to get the cards in and out."
4.0,"Have been wearing these for several months and they've held up wonderfully thru countless washes and tumble dries! I live in AZ, so in 110 degree heat any mask is hot! But these are far cooler than the disposable masks. The negative is they're made in China."
4.0,"It's ok<br />I live red white and blue I do hair and use it daily with in 3 weeks the white is ""egg shell"" off white but whatever it's good for the $"
4.0,"This shirt is cute and has the style of sleeves that I love. As other reviewers have pointed out, there is a random crystal on the front. It doesn't detract anyway and looks like it will be easy to take off"
4.0,"I ordered the pink stripe pattern in medium.  I am 5' 10"" and about 137 lbs.  I used the measurements on the size chart so I knew the top would be a little blousy on me and the waist would be a little snug.  It was just as expected and actually fit pretty good.  I used a petticoat with it to increase the volume of the skirt and make it even cuter.  My boyfriend loved it and I got a few compliments from other ladies I've never met during our night out.  I would give it 5 stars if it had pockets.  Also, even though it says polyester the fabric will wrinkle.  Easy to get out with a steam iron, though."
4.0,the sleeves are a bit tight around the arms. I'm a size 14 with DD bra size and everything else fits great.
4.0,La tela es de buena calidad y el diseño es muy bueno.
4.0,"it's good and I like it but disappointed that the lower part didn't have plastic holder, still can be tightened but not as good as with plastic holder"
4.0,"The pants and hat are adorable.  The bodysuit looked cheaply made, but I bought it for the pants anyway."
4.0,"This bra is interesting with the elastic on the back and seems to be well made. Sometimes lulu bras are too compressing and cause pain, but I like this one a lot. Not got running or high impact but perfect for Pilates or yoga or quarantine"
4.0,"I have not had a chance to wear this yet because it won't stop snowing, but it is so cute on and I cannot wait to wear it. It fit me true to size and since I'm only 5'4&#34; it is a little long as all maxis always are. A little knot or quick hem will fix it. The colors are what I expected as well. Very bright. The material does have a little shine to it but it isn't too bad. I may need to order more."
4.0,"At the time i purchased these (several of the one strap model and two of the two handle model) they were $12-14 each. For this price they are a great bargain.  They are well built with acceptable sewing, but i wouldn't overfill the single shoulder strap model as the strap can only take so much weight at the attachment point. The shoulder strap model is considerably smaller than the two handle model. I have placed a scrap cardboard rectangle cut to the size of the bottom of bag to help it maintain it's shape. Overall, they are very durable waxed(more oil than wax for sure) cotton canvas bags.  With this in mind you probably don't want to leave it on any surface you don't want oil stained.  Leave them in the trunk, truck bed, tile floor."
4.0,These are not 1.3 inches as stated
4.0,"strange material, but it fits nice and is flattering. Perfect for casual night out on summer eve. with cute sandals."
4.0,They fit great just to short! Long Leggings can always be pulled up but ones that are to short look dumb and can only be worn as capi style. Not a fan of these only due to the length. Disappointed.
4.0,"looks good feels good, no restrictions."
4.0,"inexpensive for bigger sizes. I ordered for a friend because I personally do not like tapers for stretching, but my friend seemed to like them"
4.0,"Watch arrived extremely fast and in good shape.  Instructions could have been a little clearer but they did the job.  The watch is unique and of good quality.  I get lots of attention wearing it. People are very curious.  For the quality and style the price was unbelievably low.  Fantatastic, I love it!!"
4.0,i have long les so it was short on me i had to cut the elastic in the pants off so it goes all the way down
4.0,This dress is supper comfy and fits perfect lots of complements today at work.....
4.0,"Good value for the money, but I thought that the medal portion would be a little bit smaller.  They were probably made that size so that they could be read easily."
4.0,"I was first upset that it was late, but I love the colors so that's why I bought it. The front seems a bit high from maybe it being bent while it was being shipped."
4.0,A bit thinner of a material than expected. But good overall.
4.0,I wore this dress to a wedding and received lots compliments. Would recommend
4.0,The person i gave it to was very happy. Looked nice and had good color.
4.0,"This necklace was smaller than I thought it would be but I still love it! It's very petite, lightweight  and has a nice sparkle."
4.0,Was broken upon arrival. Returned for refund. Was open at the seam
4.0,"These fit great around the waist.  A bit big, but that's why I sized up as I like it to be a little loose.  These are more to wear around the house than to work out in though as they are very short.  Even the built in under wear come to a little higher than mid thigh."
4.0,"It's a beautiful watch. More for larger wrists though. Face is very large, size of my wrist. Still fashionable and pretty!"
4.0,"The sandal came as expected they just did not fit and came a bit late after my husband already purchased another pair.  I was not favorable to having both a restocking and tax fee; quite frankly I have never paid for that from any other purchases. So, needless to say, I will not be making any future purchases from this seller."
4.0,This product is good for the price. Thank you
4.0,"I was very pleased with these. They arrived early & as described by seller. You get one of each color, black, gold, silver, blue & rainbow. Fit perfect in my 18g nose piercing. My only complaint about these is that they aren't captive (in other words don't sleep in them cause it WILL fall out) but this is obvious by the pictures & knew this before purchasing. They are a little short, but this isn't noticeable while wearing it. Easy to get in & out. I would order them again."
4.0,The color wasn’t as dark as in the photo and wasn’t consistent.  It was kind of faded looking but this was the only one available
4.0,Requires an undershirt but is very cute on
4.0,"Cute, snuggly but a bit long."
4.0,"Good styling, fab fabric. Very soft, and warm. Four stars for having narrow tapered sleeves! They're hard to push up."
4.0,"Really nice for the price.  I got a lot of compliments on these.  You can also wear the smaller one alone.  They are fairly lightweight for the size, but they did bother my ears when wearing for a long day.  Remember to buy two if you want a pair!"
4.0,"I love how it feels and looks. I ordered the silver, but it's not like the pic, it's dark, kind of a dark smoke or charcoal. It works, but I wanted a lighter color.."
4.0,"Beautiful. But a little tight on my head, so I can only wear it for a few hours before I start getting a headache."
4.0,The dress is really nice and is very comfortable. It also fits just right
4.0,these are super warm on cold days. i have been out on 25F days and they kept me nice and toasty. they are a bit thick and &#34;restrictive&#34; as they are fleece lined and got windstopper fabric but beyond that; you are probably as comfy as you can be on those cold days. (in SF Bay area)
4.0,"These hats are good. I like the double thickness on the ears. I just wish they were a little looser. They are stretchy, just not enough for my comfort. I prefer my hats to have a looser fit. But that’s just me. If you like a snug hat these would be great. I’m going to keep them and see if I can stretch them out a little bit."
4.0,"When I got the shirt I was very mad! I looked at those shirts and said I thought these were to be long. They looked about 2&#34; longer then my other tops! I m a very big girl and could not see these shirts covering much,. I put it on and it fit almost like a tight dress. I was shocked ! I love them. My daughter saw them and said mom they look nice on you. I want some!? I smiled and I'm getting her some too. , they even support my back and waist. Color's are nice. Straps are adjustable not sure if it said that but they are. I ordered xlarge. Which I wasn't so sure about because my shirts are a 2x. It fits and it stretch over all the curves lol I'm happy I even want to exercise now! Update the Rayon  blue is not like the teal somewhat shorter and the straps keep rubbing again my chest and not comfortable at all. Spend all day pulling down to Coverify butt."
4.0,"although it is warm and comfortable to wear, I feel the top is pricey. The picture shows the girl wearing top& bottom. So I thought the price was for both. Shame on me for not looking closer. It was for the top.I kept it, but next top I go for a less pricey top. I know some are not as expensive."
4.0,They were a bit scratchy at first. I found after a few washes that they softened. I got these to wear with my boots and they have held up pretty well.
4.0,"Order a XL Mens the arms are about 4"" to long and it was Snug in the chest My other XL Jackets fit fine"
4.0,"looks great, a little tight around the arms, but otherwise a good addition to my wardrobe."
4.0,"My 4 year old grandson loved this birthday gift.  He got to use it the same day that he got it.  I like the easy open and close feature and the balls on the ends, so he does't poke himself or another person in the eye.  I would have preferred it to collapse in half.  He also likes using it like a sword and a baseball bat."
4.0,"This is an updated review. I ordered a couple of these rings a few months ago.  When they came, it looked as though someone had pressed pink chewing gum in place of the rose. I returned them, but I still had another order coming.  When they came, they look just like the ones pictured (the rose is touched with gold). They are kind of bulky but actually nice looking, unique rings. The most recent ones have gold around the rose edge which makes the ring prettier."
4.0,"It’s an attractive, light weight mask that’s easier than some to breathe through.  I wish it was a little larger, top to bottom."
4.0,the pants fit great the top was kinda small.  I usually wear a large top.
4.0,"Add me to the list of those who love this dress!<br />Light weight, perfect for summer and flattering!<br />As a “mature” (over 60) woman, I worry about bust, length and waistline.<br />This is a great length, a L fits my 38C perfect and the cut hides all my added inches."
4.0,These boots are great. Good for snow and rain. Enough grip to climb around at the park. They are easily a size too big. My daughter still reaches for them over any other shoe.
4.0,"My son loved the sweater. Hes kind of husky though and i measured him every which way to make sure i got the right size, its still a little tight though. Its definitely a spring sweater cause its really thin almost see thru so make sure for winter to add a jacket to it."
4.0,"I’m trying to decide if this jacket is too long.  I felt like I was swimming in it but then I kind of like how it looks in pictures. Anyway, I’m posting a picture because I wish I saw it on some one before I bought it.  I’m 5’10 155 and have broad shoulders.  Medium felt fine except I maybe wish the sleeves were like a half an inch longer.<br />You can tell it’s quality made with quality material."
4.0,Does not close with the otter box case
4.0,"The product arrived quickly; however, when I finally checked all the pieces to create a gift for someone, the large January garnet pieces were missing, which of course, is what I needed at that particular time.  Everything else was there including an extra pair of the large stones for June.  Otherwise, the pieces are nice."
4.0,Dress is cute but you can see through it.
4.0,Fits well. Love the pockets
4.0,"This set is really beautiful and great quality. I love that the flare is 11mm instead of the normal 12mm on a 00g double flare. The fit is good, they stay in place and haven't fallen out when sleeping. (So far, anyway lol)<br />3 pairs do have defects. One of each of the brown and black wooden pairs each have a piece chipped off. The amethyst pair has a crack the length of the plug with a chip in the middle and the other one has bubbles. (See pics)<br /> I would have given 5 stars, but the day they were supposed to be delivered, I received an email saying that they weren't available and asked if I still wanted them. I've been waiting for over 6 months for my size to be available. So, I had to approve a ""reorder"" on them, then had to wait on another email to find out when they would be delivered. I received them 3 weeks after the reorder. I also had to pay $3 more than the original price. Overall, I'm very happy with the product, even with 3 damaged pairs.<br />I've written this long and detailed review because it's hard for me to find plugs that don't bother my extremely sensitive skin. Let alone double flared ones that fit so great like these do. P.S. REAL STONES Thanks!"
4.0,These pieces are very attractive. However the clicker ones are definitely not the most comfortable for daily wear. I wouldn’t use these until you are 100% certain you are fully healed as one of them did pop off unexpectedly and that is not a risk you want to take while you are still healing. However I love the opal accent. And the 13 mm length is best suited for me as opposed to the traditional 14 mm length so if you feel that you need a little bit smaller these definitely will have a better chance of suiting your needs.
4.0,Fabric is of a thin material. Could be better
4.0,Seller delivered in a timely manner and communication was good.
4.0,Love the shirt! Brought a size up due to reviews but the shirt was way to big.
4.0,Easier for my granddaughter to put on and take off
4.0,A little snug fit. Also more light weight than I thought
4.0,"Overall nice set with a unique look and very versatile with both the onyx and MOP. Really complemented the look of the modern navy tux I wore them with. They look more expensive than they are. If you look at these extremely closely you can see that the tolerances aren't very tight - there are little gaps between the stone and the metal - you can even see this in the product photos. This was a bit disappointing but in practice the gaps aren't noticeable from any normal viewing distance so ended up being a non-issue for me. Overall a good looking, decent quality stud set, and a great value."
4.0,"Great lightweight glasses. They suit my big head well without having huge lenses, and are very comfortable. Note, however, that the lenses are mirrored, which wasn't specified in the product page."
4.0,Be sure to read the description for each top. Same cut but some are 95% cotton and some 93% polyester.
4.0,It runs a little small.  I was hoping it would be baggier like the picture.  I would buy one size bigger.
4.0,They're a little smaller than I expected and they're very thin but all in all they're very cute and will keep me cool.
4.0,exactly what I wanted. great style quality and price.  too small even though I sized up so I'm returning them.
4.0,"I loved this owl! its big (the size of my palm and my hands are huge!) and totally adorable. no problems, just the chain as i got it, the chain had no clasp, by this, i mean it was just one full chain, so i had to put it over my head to put the necklace on unlike the picture, that had a clasp and the thing that you put the clasp onto. my neclace DIDNT have it, if it werent for that, this would be 5 stars. the chain is long, im 5'8 so the necklace is indeed very long, owl is EXACTLY like the picture. and yes, i do recommend this to a friend, or person."
4.0,"Only 3 of the masks had filter pockets, but you can still fit a filter under the ones that don't and they stay put pretty well. Comfortable and well made, a little big on my face but most mask are anyways."
4.0,It dose a good job. It's just not quite what I expected
4.0,"Very pretty, inexpensive and got here quickly. The only thing I would've liked to see is a picture with the earrings next to a ruler or measuring tape to see how big they were before purchasing. But overall the product and seller are good. I wear them all of the time. I will purchase from this seller again."
4.0,"Love that it has multiple pockets, good quality though has a plastic-y feel which might be good if it rains. Some may not find it super stylish, but it is convenient and hard to find bags with so many pockets."
4.0,It arrived earlier than expected. The size was perfect. Was a little expensive for the quality of fabric but overall a satisfying purchase.
4.0,It was pretty bathing suit & made with good quality of material.
4.0,"Stitches on some of the hold downs are week, but over all it worked out fine"
4.0,Had a small scratch on side/arm.
4.0,It was a good product. It came according to schedule. Looks beautiful.
4.0,These are stainless steel and very light weight. Love the color and the fit.
4.0,"I was worried this would not fit on a larger head, but it does. However, I'm not crazy about the look this gives and getting it on was not a smooth transition. I think going forward I will stick with a more basic design."
4.0,"This shirt is very pretty, it would have gotten 5 stars if the fabric were a bit less clingy.  It doesn't hide the lumps well enough."
4.0,Big great watch!!
4.0,Shirt is super cute. Fits slightly smaller than expected but still works for me as I generally order slightly larger than my actual size in cool weather shirts. I do this for the most comfort and the ability to layer. I will not be able to layer with this one but it's still nice. Works as a casual and a slightly up dressed addition to my closet.
4.0,material not as soft as expected
4.0,Got the small and medium for my 2 year old son... both fit him well. I prefer the medium but both fit him. I recommend them for compression purposes
4.0,"Dress arrived yesterday, fits good and love the texture."
4.0,"Fit my daughter perfectly, she wore it to her 5th grade graduation."
4.0,ordered the wrong size
4.0,They seem to be of decent quality. I haven't worn them yet
4.0,Fast shipping necklace as advertized.  Very satisfied
4.0,"It is well made but shorter than I expected.  It will actually work for us though, as it will be prefect for &#34;Tall Alice&#34; in Alice in Wonderland Jr."
4.0,"I really was hoping to get this set of Silver Black Blue Gold Stainless Steel Stud Hoop huggie Earrings ( 4 Pairs ) by MOWOM for myself as well as my 3 year old. However upon receiving them I realize how very small of hoops they are, and unfortunately they do not fit on my ears. My earring holes are somewhat high on my ears and I have larger lobes so these do not fit me at all, which would be one of my biggest complaints. They do fit nicely on my 3 ear old who has much lower holes and thinner lobes. They are a bit thick, but not so thick that they look strange on her, which is nice. A thing I have found with my 3 year old is that she loses backs off her normal stud earrings, so a very nice thing about these hoops are they are one solid piece that clips together and is not pulled apart easily. This makes it almost impossible for her to lose an earring, which is great. The colors are very bright and beautiful, and she has been wearing the blue set for a week without any noticeable wear to the patina of the earring. Also the fact that they are stainless steel is great, any professional piercing parlor will encourage you, and normally starts their customers off wearing stainless steel jewelry. The stainless steel does not cause any reaction or irritation and is easy to keep clean. Make sure these will fit your lobes, and other than that its a pretty good product. I received this product at a discounted rate"
4.0,This is a great pair of warm thick socks.  The socks are well made.  The inside of the socks are very fuzzy and warm.  Good elastic at the top.  The heel and toes are thick and should last for some time.  Wonderful pair of socks for any cold weather.  The reason for me taking 1 star away from these wonderful socks is these socks are NOT heated.  There are no heating wires or pockets for heat pouches. They should not be advertised this way.  These are wonderful WARM socks.
4.0,This anklet is so cute it does last a while then starts to change colors after a few weeks.
4.0,It's pretty decent and the price is right.
4.0,"I ordered a large which is my normal size and it fits but it’s snug. An XL would be better but I’m keeping it. I’m glad I recently dropped a few pounds or this would definitely be going back. I’m 5’6”, 157.<br />The fabric is soft and very lightweight, a little sheer. I’ll wear nude under it, not white (or dark). The fit is flattering and the skirt hits my knee so it’s not as short as some sundresses are. Overall I love it and can’t wait to wear it!"
4.0,"I agree with the June 10 review same thing happened to me. I ordered a Large way to large kept it away, then ordered the medium, kept it, still to large and yes the elastic waist band is way to loose, if they could tighten that up, it would be perfect. I am 5'3 135 lbs chest is 38 no bra on."
4.0,Only reason it's 4 stars vs 5 stars is that the earrings are kind of hefty... Still beautiful so I've kept them!
4.0,very reasonably priced and I like it
4.0,No reaction to stainless steel and I like the selection
4.0,"Price alone is not a good measure of value for glasses but I don't plan to wear these often or for long periods. I notice that it takes a few minutes for my vision to adjust to either the distortion, polarization or both. But after a while it settles in and I don't notice either. My cars display screens don't tend to darken when I tilt my head, which makes me wonder how strong the polarization actually is. I'll need to evaluate this further with glare off water or other reflective surfaces, but suffice it to say that I have no complaints about it even if it is weakly polarized. I haven't had them long enough to evaluate the lens scratch resistance. The case is nice and it comes with a soft cleaning cloth."
4.0,"(disclaimer: currently i cannot post any media. as soon as this issue is resolved I will try to update the review with photos)<br />This fit to the size chart listed, so get the size you are comfortable wearing. We all have the recommended size to wear then we have the size we like to we whatever that might be. Some like the security of feeling things snug against the body, some feel trapped, so they like it looser fitting. All I am saying is the measurements were accurate so get the size you are comfortable in whatever that is.<br /><br />As far as the function of the period lining, these I would say are for your light to med light days. I would not use these for overnight or heavy days. If you are one with a heavy flow you may need to use another product and wear these as a backup.  I got these for my daughter for just that reason. On her heaviest days, when she's working, she often cannot get to use the facilities for hygiene care. These give her the peace of mind that No overflow will happen.<br /><br />But as for sleeping they do not come up high enough in the back nor are they thick enough to wear alone unless it is for the light days.<br /><br />You could use it for nighttime sweating for those of us getting older. One less area of the bed soaked through. Or if you have had children, coughing and sneezing can be dangerous no matter how many Kegel exercises you have done. You could wear these for those unexpected events.<br /><br />Just don't think that these are going to get you through the heaviest days alone and I think you will be pleased with these.<br /><br />{If this is helpful, please let me know so I know what to continue putting in written reviews. Thanks, I appreciate the help. Cheers!}"
4.0,"I purchased this as a gift for my fancy, well dressed aunt. She loved it!"
4.0,"Fun and funky looking pillow shoes, but way too big. Order 2 sizes down."
4.0,This bag was not what I expected.  It looks different in person than in the picture.  I like the color and material but it sits slouchy which I guess its supposed to but then the canvas is kind of stiff so it doesn't really work.  So I decided  to use it more as regular bag and its too small to fit much in it the way its designed.  Now I am using it to hold my crotchet work and it works perfect for that.  It just wasn't quite what I expected.
4.0,Super cute but gets tangled easily
4.0,Perfect for two friends.
4.0,"This hat runs a little small, but is very smart looking and basically what I expected. It was packaged well, not dented or damaged, and arrived promptly. Good purchase."
4.0,"Good fit, good quality.  The only thing I would change is the liner piece at the top of the zipper is quite heavy, and sometimes I prefer to keep the top unzipped a few inches (above cleavage but unzipped to create nice V neck).  The liner - which keeps the zipper off your skin when it’s zipped to the top - is rather heavy and thick and not attractive when I want to wear as v neck.  WHen zipped to the top you don’t see the liner and it’s not an issue.  Outdoors I keep it zipped all the way up - but inside I like to unzip a few inches and generally don’t because of the “clunky” liner"
4.0,Fits as expected. Bought my normal size. Very soft fabric and light weight. Only wish that it was a tad bit longer in the back. Came with a cute hair tie too.
4.0,It’s pretty nice. The only thing is one of the hoops keeps sliding of my ear so I have to push the earrings ends closer to each other sometimes...if that makes any sense. But they do give you a pink bag with it and I think that’s awesome and thoughtful
4.0,Little longer than expected
4.0,"It came exactly as described and actually works like a real watch... I just can't, for the life of me, figure out how to adjust the time. ah well. Still a great cosplay item for an Ed costume"
4.0,B is like an A
4.0,"Really nice if you need to hide your piercing or if you don't want to take it out during surgery, only thing is that this is not 5/8 cause it's shorter than my current 5/8 piercing I would say this is closer to 3/8"
4.0,"Nice, a little large"
4.0,"Good product, however with the insert,a little low in the heel area."
4.0,"I am almost 5'5&quot; and weight between 125 and 130. I read the reviews and bought a large size. The bottoms that great. The top is actually a little bit tight around the bust area, and I'm not even that large busted (34B). The main problem I have, is the bottom part of the top. It flares out and looks really funky. I am not going to return the product as I love everything else about it, and I don't think it will take too much effort to bring in the seams on the side. The material and color some really high-quality, and as pictured as on Amazon."
4.0,"band is good band..., but colors are WAAAAAAAAYYYYY off from pictured... pictures are MUCH darker..."
4.0,I did receive both items for my daughter and they look great!
4.0,Beautiful earings. Took forever to get delivered.
4.0,"I thought I ordered a plain black hat,plus it is somewhat small."
4.0,"I love this jacket. It is VERY small, though. I normally wear a small or medium and after reading the reviews I went with a large. The large is still a little snug... wish I would have went with an XL. Other than that it's really nice."
4.0,Wonderful earrings for the price.
4.0,This works exactly as intended. I thought because of the picture that it might be a little larger. But also I kind of have a big head.
4.0,Cheaply made but they work well and my 8 year old son loves them.
4.0,Not as long as hoped - love the color
4.0,I like this design. It is good for the cheap price. My only complaint is that it runs a bit small so I had issues putting it on my neck. I wore this to an event and got compliments on it. It was a costume event though so I wouldn't suggest these for a &#34;high class&#34; kind of event. They would work great for costumes and casual use though.
4.0,"I bought this as a gift and I was pleasantly surprised.  The only thing I did not like was I did not notice when purchasing but the fabric has a pink and tiny white butterfly design. I really wish it were solid pink. Aside from that, it fits perfect, perfect length (person in the photo is 5'2. No fraying tearing or discoloration after washes and it is not see through. The cuffs are great for people even with small wrists and it does not fall. Great detail. Person I bought it for raves about it and absolutely loves it. Also it is lightweight so it doesnt get too hot which is great. Last thing to note is the fabric is not stretchy so be aware of that if you prefer your dresses with stretch."
4.0,Cute boots but one boot was a lot wider than the other. Had to add a thick insole to try to even them out. and. they were still too big. I wear an 8 and ordered an 8. Gave that pair away and ordered a 7. Still had to add an insole. Great looking  boot for the price and came earlier than expected.
4.0,"Love the fit and the soft fabric, size up it does run small, I'm a 36C usually get M size I ordered L fits ok. The peddling is not that great had to remove the pads, looks better without it."
4.0,Brim is very large. Had to wear it for a while so my toddler could could get use to wearing it.
4.0,Nice shoe. Good material. Seems like not real nike product though.
4.0,"This item arrived pretty quickly.<br />Overall good quality and color.<br />I was a little disappointed in the fabric. I didn’t read clearly, thought it would be at least 45% cotton.<br />Doesn’t really breathe…"
4.0,"I bought this for my 10 year old grand daughter.  It runs slightly small, so I would recommend ordering one size up.  It washes up well, and didn't shrink but just a little.  If you order up one size, you will be fine after washing and drying the outfit.  Nice fabric, well made."
4.0,Looks good but the chain is cheap and needs to be replaced
4.0,"Overall I'm pleased with the necklace. It looks nice and has a decent weight. No one would ever mistake them for real pearls, but they're pretty and fun (especially for the price). I'll see how they hold up over time."
4.0,"I love the feminine quality of this dress. The lace neckline is darling, and the blue color totally pops! The material that the dress is made from is nice and sturdy - no full dress slip necessary. Although cute by itself, it has a more finished look with a petticoat underneath. This dress is perfect for both wearing to work or going out."
4.0,"Very stylish, my friend loves it."
4.0,"Husband loved the jacket though it was slightly large on him. I should have bought his normal size but sized up due to the Asian sizing. Fabric was nice, lining is soft and warm according to him."
4.0,My daughter loves these and they are very cute.
4.0,"Nice teeshirts but run small, i normally wear a XL but ordered this in a 3X because of the reviews an it fits perfectly."
4.0,"Beautiful shoes, but unfortunately there is some extra glue that was dropped in a couple of different spots on both shoes. I wish quality control was more diligent."
4.0,"I loved the looks of the shoe...as did my granddaughter, who I bought the boots for. Alas they were too small so they were resold to a friend at work and she said they are very comfortable!"
4.0,"The white is a cream white, not pure white. Semi see thru, and not thick. Definitely not &#34;sweater&#34;. You need to wear a tank top underneath. Otherwise, ordering one size up should make it fit like the model. Lots of tummy room. Can be bunched up to sit on your hips or pulled down to cover your behind. Can be worn off the shoulder or not, dressed up or down. Quite versatile."
4.0,Very comfortable.  Fit as expected. Very pretty shoe
4.0,The dress is lovely.  I would love it more if it were lined.<br /><br />It is priced reasonably and love that you can machine wash...
4.0,"The overall quality of these tights is amazing! However, they are not true to size and run very small."
4.0,The dress is not the fabric I expected. The fit is very tight for a curvy woman. Have to wear a jacket over it.
4.0,"Great product, fits well for larger faces, well designed."
4.0,"I just received these boots today, exactly on time when they were supposed to come in!  They are super cute!  They fit perfectly around the calf, which was what I was really worried about.  Unfortunately they are HUGE around the ankle making the boot slump.  There was no support there at all which is why I gave it a four out of five stars.  Also, I got these boots for just under $40 with shipping.  I was expecting a decent looking shoe, nothing too fancy or anything and I got what I thought I was getting.  From up close you can definitely tell they are not true leather, but then again I wasn't expecting real leather so whatever.  From a distance they look super real though.  Also, the heel is just right, not too big or too little.  The bottom part of them boots don't look like they have a decent tread for walking around in snow so just beware of that.  I'm not keeping them long enough to find out. Tomorrow I will be returning these beauties and looking for others."
4.0,"Great dress, good material."
4.0,Strap feels small like for a kids watch.
4.0,"Beautiful patriotic bracelet made up of glass not plastic beads so it does sparkle and shine with vibrant colors.  I am giving it only four stars because although it is 7.5"" it is a torsade style and should be twisted which shortens the bracelet.  It needs to be another 1/2"" longer for more flexibility.  I can usually wear a 7.25” bracelet without any problem but a little extra room to have it drape would be perfect."
4.0,"Great fabric weight. Nice and warm. Washes well but be prepared for some shrinkage as it definitely shrinks. The only complaint I have is that the neck hole is quite small so it may not be a great choice for adults. I bought a medium for my 12 year old daughter. It fits a bit big, but she is very small for her age and likes the oversized look so it's fine. Colors stay vibrant after washing. No noticable fading."
4.0,A bit thin for the price.
4.0,The orange in the picture is definitely not the same as what I received!  I should of known though since it did say NEON orange!  Be prepared for
4.0,Loved the hoops. They were a little too tight on my earlobes so used on them on my upper ear piercing. They look cute. Can't complain.
4.0,"I wish I could give it a 5 star review but cant. Its big on me, but I still love it, its beautiful. I am a 26 waist and it feels loose."
4.0,"Very nice dress! I’m 5’1 it hit at my calf, the material is soft and stretchy runs to size maybe could have sized down one. The lace on the arms does not stretch much my upper arm was snug. If you have larger upper arms I wouldn’t recommend it."
4.0,Nice color. The material is rather thin. It looks really pretty when I use scarf around my neck or tie one around my waist.
4.0,"Good product. Not as high quality as I expected. The inside of the wallet isn't leather and the two sides of the wallet don't align correctly, but good enough."
4.0,"Very cute and comfy, however they are a little small.  Fit's me fine because I have small narrow feet."
4.0,"PROS<br />- Cute design<br />- Very lightweight and comfortable to wear<br /><br />CONS<br />- Wood material may not do well if it gets wet<br />- The back is blank so you have to worry about these flipping around<br /><br />NOTES<br />- They are very medium-sized, about as big as my palm, which may be a pro or con depending on your preferences"
4.0,"Nice looking hat, very light and comfortable."
4.0,"Very pretty - love the design, but it runs small - just fits my wrist with no extra room and so is a little uncomfortable - measurement with the product would be helpful."
4.0,I like the length of it. Love the hoodie
4.0,"This is very thin, very loose, and wrinkles pretty bad. It’s 100% rayon and says to lay flat to dry. I washed it in the washer and dried it on low heat and it shrank some, making it look better. I will wear it but I would not purchase it again. I’m 5’3” and about 115, I have a small frame but huge boobs. The small fits, but an extra small would have been way better if that was an option. Not a huge fan."
4.0,"This is a nice little trinket, but the decorations do fade pretty fast. It is good for large or small wrists because you can wrap it either 2 or 3 times around."
4.0,"A very nice pendant...the charm is a good size and weight and should not discolor over time.  The necklace is not my favorite style, but I did receive compliments when I wore it."
4.0,"Too, a while, but I do like them."
4.0,"I got these slippers for my wife so these were her impressions of them. She said the house slippers are extremely comfortable. They have a good amount of cushion on the bottom. The material is not dense like memory foam but more squishy like foam. They also have a more durable surface on the sole of the shoe. There is texture to help  prevent slipping and they are more rugged for indoor/outdoor use. The slippers have a bit of detail with the plaid and solid gray. They are attractive and match most things. They are easy to slip on. In terms of size she said that if you are between a size to go up a size. I did get size 9 and they fit her exactly like they should. There is absolutely no wiggle room for even a 9 1/2. They will most definitely not fit a size 10 comfortably. She said an 8 1/2 could probably fit in these though. Her toes go all the way to the top and the heel is all the way at the back. So summarizing, maybe half a size down to true size would fit. I personally feel like the price feels a little steep for the quality."
4.0,"My 3 year old loves this umbrella but definitely made for toddlers, small and quality lacking, the metal spindles detach easy but I just pop them back in the plastic tips, maybe super glue would help"
4.0,Good product. Kept my sunglasses in place.
4.0,"I recommend that anyone with a 1377 or 1322 purchase and install this upgrade. It makes it a snap to upgrade your sights to a scope or red dot. Be advised, however, that the upgrade may not be as simple as it appears. The slot for the breech I received was not machined properly. As a result, the assembled bolt and bolt handle would not move in the slot. Individually, the parts appeared to fit, however once the handle was fitted to the bolt body, the handle bound in the slot. Upon close examination, I discovered that the slot was milled unevenly and there was insufficient clearance on the inner edge of the slot. I considered returning the unit, but as I was eager to try my new pistol, I elected to correct the problem. Using a Dremel tool with diamond cutters and needle files, I recut the bevel on the slot. It was a simple, if somewhat tedious procedure. I have the tools and experience, but someone lacking either might be better off returning the unit for a new one. Gunsmiths charge $60 or $70 an hour, at least, so that's not a cost effective option.<br /><br />When you receive your breech, before beginning the upgrade, place the bolt body in the breech, screw in the handle, and check that the bolt will slide freely from front to back and turn down into the locked position. If it does, you are good to go.<br /><br />Other than this one glitch, I am very pleased with this product. None of the videos I viewed prior to my purchase mentioned the problem I experienced, so it's possible I was just &#34;lucky&#34;."
4.0,"i was super surprised by this. the quality is better than expected for the price, and it actually fit really really well! take a chance on this dress. i have a pear shaped body and dont think body-con dresses look very good on me, but this looked like a dream! im so happy with it. my C cups fit in it too!! for reference i am 5' and 130 lbs."
4.0,"This suit is cute, but it was tight on my lower half and then loose on the top.  I have DDs too.  Otherwise it was really cute"
4.0,Good fit.  Fun to wear.  Got compliments when I wore it.
4.0,Cute top.  I bought a small and it’s baggy.  I still wear it w leggings and it’s cute.
4.0,I think these really need to be more clear on  the size they run small so be sure to get 2 sizes up. And bring spare shoes they get uncomfy after a while and the pinky pops out of the shoe often.
4.0,"Love the ease of use but wish the speakers themselves could be adjusted within the beanie.. VERY loud which is a plus and most say they cannot hear what I'm listening to. Only real ""negative"" would be you cannot lie in bed with these if you're a side sleeper. Speaker will dig into your ear. Otherwise they're a great headphone beanie."
4.0,"Well made, comfortable and durable."
4.0,I thought these were gonna be more like terry cloth or softer material. It's more like the material you'd see on a bathing suit. But they are comfortable and I still use them at the gym.
4.0,"Took a long time to get, very thin, good for spring"
4.0,Nice Fit.  Cry comfortable
4.0,"Great idea. The key loops come with a real small normal loop I suppose for keys with small holes that will not work with the Bang Ti. The tall squared off shape does not work for all keys and the edges are a little sharp. This sharpness can scratch things it comes in contact with.<br /><br />Overall, it’s a good idea but it is not perfect."
4.0,"Great gift for girl.,"
4.0,It’s beautiful and elegant at the same time! Makes mommies cool...<br />I’m so in love with this watch that I’ve started wearing it everyday! I love the sounds of the charms!<br />The only problem is that one charm fell off so I connected it and then another one fell off and I can’t find it. I wonder if I can buy it separately
4.0,"This peach dress is cute, but very thin material. I believe a slip will remedy the problem. The size medium was a correct fit. I also purchased the green wrap dress, which is not flattering on."
4.0,"very good replacement. Good fit, easy to replace. 4 versus 5 stars because it has developed a crack at the hole where the buckle goes in, so definitely is not going to last as long as the OEM band. BUT at least you can find this unique replacement. And I can't believe how many people still recognize the SWATCH watch."
4.0,Dress was very long. Wanted to wear with flat sandals but I end up stepping on the dress. Will need to wear heels or tie st the bottom. Everything else was great. Very comfortable.
4.0,I purchased the 06-7581 black version of this handbag for my elderly mother.  She is fairly happy with it.  Her 10”x 4.5” disabled parking placard fits nicely in it.  She also likes the organization of the purse.  There is one section with a 6.5” x 4” pocket.  A zipped section in the center of wallet and other valuables.  A second section with two 3.5” x 5” pockets.  My iPhone XR fits nicely in them.  These sections are secured with a 2.5” flap with a magnetic button.  Finally there a narrow section which is secured with a bar fastener.  The 6” x 5” handles fit nicely on your wrist.  Mom also likes the red lining as it makes it easier to where everything is.  I like that the lining’s fabric is a heavier weight so hopefully it won’t tear easily.<br /><br />Some of the bag’s negatives have been noted in other reviews.  The handbag is heavy.  I’m guessing it weights about 3lbs empty.  It doesn’t sound like a lot but it is definitely noticeable.  The cardboard(?) is apparent when the bag’s sides are flexed and you hear the cardboard moved.  The magnetic button could be stronger.  The shoulder strap is hard to adjust.  Finally mom wishes the bag was a little wider and shorter.
4.0,This sweater is not vanilla cream as advertised.<br />It’s a light heather grey.<br />The sweatshirt is very comfortable and fits true to size. I ordered a medium - my usual size.<br />It’s more a fitted sweatshirt - it’s not baggy.<br />Well made and soft. Color is completely misleading.
4.0,"4 stars, packaging sucked.  was squashed, but I can steam it, and it will be just fine, nice hat."
4.0,"It's cute enough, I had just hoped for a bit more structure/shape from the chest down. I suppose that can make it more flattering though...?"
4.0,"Good price, nice material, nice fitting."
4.0,"I love this necklace. It came very quickly. I would offer a word of caution on two things, though. It is definitely made for narrower necks. The way it curves does not look quite as nice on a larger neck. Also, the earrings are clip-ons, as pictured, not posts, as described."
4.0,"These stones are very nice. Out of the three I got one stone that did not have the &#34;snowflake&#34; design on it, but the other two are gorgeous."
4.0,"I only gave 4 out of 5 stars because the material is thinner than I expected it to be. Do not get me wrong though. I LOVE this bag! I do not think that it would be a great makeup bag because the inside is a type of cotton material. I bought it to hold my pens. It is well made, quite spacious and larger than I expected! :)"
4.0,"these are cute. It fits well on my baby (8m), and even my 3 y\o likes to &#34;steal&#34; it occasionally. It is not tide or loose (not sure how long will it stay that way.. will update if needed).<br />I do like the set, however, if the variety of colors matters to you, note that I got two white bows and no light pink."
4.0,The sleeves are a little tight and also the next but will still wear it no problem
4.0,I liked it very much however the sizing is not meant for the U.S.
4.0,Use the around the house for cold hands associated the Raynauds syndrome
4.0,The lace gives any outfit a sultry vibe without being vulgar. I definitely recommend wearing a regular strapless bra underneath since the lace is very sheer and doesn't offer any support. Nice layering accesory without the bulk. Got one in white as well!
4.0,soft - perfect color
4.0,It is really cute and covers my tummy great. The only thing I didn't like is the support on top. There is next to none and I feel like I'm going to fall out.
4.0,I’m a huge Harry Potter fan but there are some of these I can’t possibly tell who is who. Please post of name photo
4.0,I use these for my yoga class mostly. they are super comfy and I appreciate the high waist option. the only thing I didn't like was the instructions for how to wash these. I just wash on a delicate cycle by themselves then line dry and no colors have bled through yet.
4.0,They look very cute. One trip so far and they're still holding.
4.0,"Arrived early. Heavy duty, worth the money but one of the bottom pieces was slightly warped. Fits comfortably despite the warped part."
4.0,"While I wish they were a bit narrower, these bracelets add a fun bit of color to casual wear! They are comfortable to wear, and the colors are bright and eye catching. More for summer wear than winter, they will be really nice when the weather gets warmer!"
4.0,"Really disappointed that these didn't fit right. They're super cute and the colors are so fun. They just ran small, and it's been a challenge trying to get them returned and reordered."
4.0,this fit well enough. Sometimes they slip off my foot. Not all the time which is weird but whatever. The price is great and on the days it doesn't slip off they work great.
4.0,"Super cute top, however I am a 36 DDD and the medium was just a little to snug at the chest so it didn't lay right. SO CLOSE! I am defintley keeping and giving to a girlfriend as a gift because it is that cute!"
4.0,It’s pretty. But much bigger than I expected. It’s kind of bulky. I’m petite so not really my style.
4.0,"The model definitely wears it best. I would wear these around the house but not out in public. They fit good and the fabric is soft and lightweight. The stripe on the top sits awkwardly on the chest, when worn it just seems out of place. I’m thinking of maybe adding something to mine maybe. This is just ok. Moderately comfortable."
4.0,It's cute has a really good material and I've gotten a lot of compliments  how ever the back is a goes down a bit too far for me
4.0,Fit is good except they are a little long on me and I'm 6 foot talk
4.0,It's just what I wanted. Not too heavy nor too light.
4.0,"A nice necklace for the price, but in the picture the copper one in my opinion and in the opinion of 3 of my bridesmaids I asked looked nicer than the silver aspen leaves sold by the same company, but in life, at least in my opinion, don't know what the others would say yet, the copper ones look somewhat cheesy or fake, especially when compared with the silver ones.  Also, I expected them to be bigger than 1&#34; x 1&#34;.  I think the ad said they varied in size and were around 1&#34; x 1 1/2&#34; , which was close, but I would have liked to have had that little extra size as I santed them to be more easily visible when my bridesmaids wore them."
4.0,"I really loved this suit, just not for me. I am a 34 DDD and there was no way this L was going to fit my top. It was great material though and I loved the colors. Wish it would have worked!"
4.0,This scarf works well.  The zipper is a little hard to find (the point of it) and a little challenging to zip/ unzip.  But does what is advertises.
4.0,"Useful, great for price. Def serves the purpose. Nice velcro in the back,  the colors are ok too. Smells a bitbwhen you take them out but it goes away."
4.0,Colors are vibrant and beautiful. Nice chest/top support.
4.0,"Unfortunately, received the wrong item, returned."
4.0,Good fabric stretchy sweaterlike and it fits well.
4.0,If i ordered my normal size they would be definitely to small. I ordered a size UP from my normal waist size because I don’t know the brand name but other than a slight snugness they fit well and seem nicely made.
4.0,It kept the mosquitoes out of our faces. Comfortable to wear. Did the job. I like the vents at the top of the hat. Good value.
4.0,"Wonderful collection pieces, but the pin needle are not long enough for thick clothing. If the pen needle was long enough then I would give it a 5 stars."
4.0,"this dress is not as flattering as it seems with the scrunch along the side, doesn’t show off much curves & the strings at the bottom are so long it’s hard to style them to go out. But it’s great material super thick and super stretchy."
4.0,"These Pom poms are very cute when you see them in person. I used them as accent pieces in my scrapbook. The colors are very bright and the quality is great and the feather puffs don't fall apart.  I can also see these being used for little girls headband due to there durability! Some of the feathers did come off, but that didn't leave any of them bare and wasn't enough to make a big different. They are all still nice and full.<br /><br />I cannot find any negative reasons why you shouldn't get this product.  I am very happy with them.  Thank you.<br /><br /> I received this item for free  for an honest review."
4.0,"I was very pleased. Very cute and stylish. The only problem I had is the silver on the back of the tassels started to rust. I usually don't take out my piercing to shower so it got wet. Pure silver doesn't rust and I would've appreciated a warning. It looks very nice and I get complemented on it often, just don't shower or swim with it. Other than that, I love it."
4.0,The beanie itself is nice and stretchy and soft! I understand it’s a fisherman style but I was hoping it would go down low enough to cover my ears during my work time. (I work late at night). I liked this beanie because I usually have my hair up in a bun and I wanted the beanie to go over my bun and possibly cover my ears but it was too short. Still a nice beanie though!
4.0,"The gi is excellent. Good quality, accurate sizing. I removed a star because I did not receive a belt as the description stated."
4.0,"I had to let anyone thinking about this shock alarm clock wrist device that it is changing my life. I would sleep all day and be up all night and sometimes slept so late it made more sense to stay up than go to bed. My sleep was ruining my life. I did sleep studies, started using a cpap machine, I even had an operation on my sinuses, and I still couldn't regulate my sleep. I quit my last job because I was going to work on 3 or 4 hours of sleep a night. I'm not kidding, and I'm not a stooge for the company or free product reviewer.<br /><br />I shocked myself once when I got it to see how strong it was and it isn't all that bad even at 75% (which is as high as I went) but I sure did know it had shocked me, so I set my alarm for 7:59am and the watch for 8am and set it for no snoozing and deactivate with the code then stuck the QR code to the wall in another room. I have got up every morning for about 3 months and only been shocked again a few times when I was moving too slowly. I'm usually up and into the other room before it gets me.<br /><br />You do have to exert some willpower. You could take it off (the company sells little locking devices for the strap, I haven't tried them but it's a good idea). You could go to the other room, deactivate it, then go back to bed. You need to go to bed at a time when you will get enough sleep before the alarm. You have to actually set it in the first place, lol. But it REALLY helps get me out of the bed to start with.<br /><br />My wife and family are all amazed. I've been doing university online, but in January I will be back in the workplace and I was really concerned about being able to manage sleep, but not anymore. I get up, I have a day, I see my friends and family, and I get some sunlight and even leave the house! It's incredible!<br /><br />Couple of other points - it is a big chunky item to have strapped to your wrist. After the first few days I was waking up with a bruise where it had been pushed down by me sleeping on it. I fixed this by wearing the 'watch' part on the inside of my wrist and it has improved, it still isn't great, but it works. The 3rd version looks slimmer but it also costs quite a lot more. Idk if it's slimmer enough for a $100 price increase. Also, this model (2nd) seems to be a lot more robust than people were reporting the 1st one to be, so I recommend it for that, obviously I can't say how it will last longer term, but it seems solid. I only wear it at night and put on a real watch during the day, so it shouldn't take so much wear that way. Idk how the battery will last over time either, but it lasts a little less than a week at the moment. I'm hoping to establish enough of a habit that I won't need the shocker later, but even if I need to buy a new one every year or so I will do it because it has made such a difference for me. I didn't buy the 3rd edition because of the price and it might not last judging from some of the other reviews, so I went for an in between cost, but they seem to be improving each new model. One last complaint, the app is awful. They say they are improving it, but it is like 1990s apple Mac, you can make it work, but it is glitchy as anything. Hopefully that will get better and it isn't a deal breaker for the alarm clock function because I can set it, pair it, and the QR works for turning it off, which is all I need.<br /><br />There you go, I say buy it if you are a hardcore sleeper and have trouble snoozing your alarm while fully still asleep. Buy it if you think you will work with it to get up and stay up. It helps like nothing else I tried. 😊😴"
4.0,Just a little narrow on the toes
4.0,"Helped as soon as I put it on, slept in it and it worked wonders! No shoulder pain in the morning!"
4.0,very happy with this purchas.
4.0,It is nice a little small but works great
4.0,Lace on pic seems to be better than actual one and the sleeves shorter than pic. I will probably change the lace later. But the dress looks really nice and good material. I purchased the green.
4.0,I loved this dress so much but the slit comes up too high for me to be able to wear it confidently. My crotch could be glimpsed as I walked
4.0,Love the shirt wish I did size up
4.0,I'm pleased with this purchase. A little blingy as it's kinda shiny.
4.0,Would have gotten 5 stars if it had not been for the sizing being a little off.
4.0,"I liked this bathing suit and it fit as I expected it too. I ordered a size up from my regular size and boy am I glad it did because this fit perfect, my normal size would have been too small. The top comes with little cups in them but doesn't have any support what so ever. It is not see through when it is wet either which is a plus. I use this bathing suit when I am laying outside to tan because the top doesn't really stay up when it is wet but it is perfect to tan in."
4.0,"Light weight, good material"
4.0,This jacket is a great buy..it keeps my daughter very warm. Even in cold and chilly weather. .it's not very thick but the material it's made from sure holds up and provides a great layer of comfort and protection. Highly recommend.
4.0,Pretty blouse. I bought xxl and I weigh 140 and typically wear sm. The xxl fits is a little loose fitting.  If I had gotten a sm I believe it would have been too sm
4.0,Unhemed leg cuff seems long very good quality.
4.0,For the price how could you go wrong. The removable pads are sort of odd but overall very comfortable. I ordered one in every color after my first purchase.
4.0,"Size 6/8 actually refers to Size Small, not Medium. Overall the design looks good, as expected from the picture."
4.0,It was a bit snug even thou I ordered a size up
4.0,"Love it, its a bit wide for the size of shoe, i would know as i usually need a wide shoe, could probably fit much better with thicker socks. Make sure you wear ankle or knee socks as the faux velvet inside will rub your raw! Also noticed if your clumsy like me and you often trip on your own feet the sold of one shoe will mark the velvet on the outside of the other leaving a grey rubber skid mark... So far it wipes off with water and light scrubbing but it really should have a protective spray over it... Or just dont be clumsy i guess. But i love them anyway"
4.0,"These leggings are the cutest!  Any little girl would love the mermaid scallop detail, not to say, the sparkle! They are sure to be a hit! The price is also very reasonable."
4.0,"I ordered a XL based on the reviews to order one size down.  Love this blouse.  Good quality lace.  I'm smaller at the top with fuller hips, so it's not loose in that area.  I would recommend to purchase"
4.0,Order up a size or two. The sleeves are snug and fabric is thicker than the solid color version I've ordered.
4.0,"Lovely, fabric drapes soft & lovely. It is so very pretty too."
4.0,"Cute shirt. I was surprised that the material thicker than I expected. The shirt is a little too loose fitting for the size, though."
4.0,"Great looking glasses. Not as good in the bright sun as I hoped for, but worth the purchase price regardless."
4.0,"I am having brachioplasty in two months and am stocking up ahead of my surgery.  This is a great unit, however the sleeves are slightly too short and would no doubt cut into my incisions.  No worries, until then this makes a great piece for layering under sleeveless items."
4.0,Wish it had a second little strap not just one
4.0,Very cute but smaller than expected fit.
4.0,Cute but ran a little sm
4.0,I wear an 14 pant and bout the 2x.  When I bought the 3x they were way too large
4.0,I paid special attention to all the reviews saying to size up from your normal size and I received my sweater and I'm so glad I sized up because it's the perfect fit.  Quality is great but I haven't washed my sweater so i don't know what would happen if I did.  But I plan on ordering more colors in this style.
4.0,"It's as solid and sturdy as it looks. I need to send it to an engraver to have my medical info engraved, but feels weighty and solid."
4.0,Comfy but looks a bit cheap. Bra straps will show.
4.0,"Beautiful sweater. Very soft! I hoped this sweater would be a bit more oversized like the picture, but it is smaller than expected. It doesn't quite drape how I would of liked it, but still a great sweater"
4.0,"Stretchy top seems comfy, but rather thin fabric. This would be a decent dress for casual wear, or over leggings like a tunic. Not too great if you have broad shoulders and large biceps, though."
4.0,Their awesome
4.0,I gave my GD a choice between the mermaid and the unicorn pillow.  She chose the unicorn and it was just the right size for a young child.  She's 5 and in pre-k.  The quality was very good and the covering can be removed for light cleaning.
4.0,A lot bigger than I expected and it was really thick. So it will be good for winter for sure.
4.0,Suprising nice. Definately only indoor flip flops around the house. They are really sturdy and appear well made. My feet do feel better.
4.0,"Pretty sun dress, kinds of transparent. Odd fitting in the chest area. Buy a size up."
4.0,VERY CUTE BUT WASN'T THE BEST QUALITY
4.0,"I really am enjoying this ""knock-around"" dress.  It is light, airy and cool for our intense heat/humidity"
4.0,"They're cute, just like the picture. Just wish I would have ordered an X-Large instead of a Large. I'm a C36 so bra sizing gets tricky sometime.<br />They squeeze my breast too tight if I wear them all day but overall they fit pretty good."
4.0,"It came very quickly, I think it's beautiful, and I love the packaging. I would have given it 5 stars but my one issue is, I do not like the stretchy cord. I prefer a non-stretch string as I feel they are stronger, but overall I am very happy with my purchase. I love that I can wear it as a bracelet or as a necklace."
4.0,Nice looking blouse but a little tight in the middle.
4.0,"This was a gift for my teen daughter. She really liked the rotating feature. The ring is a good value for the price. The metal is a little bit ""iffy."" I don't know yet how sturdy it is or how long it will last...only time will tell. That's my only concern. O ther than that thebring is very nice."
4.0,Cute. Made me look like a pumpkin but a cute one!!!
4.0,Love these.. very pretty and good quality. I only give 4 stars because nose piece does get caught in your hair when placed on top of head.. still a great purchase.
4.0,"Fits as expected though because its about 45% polyester, it'll make ironing it interesting. Pretty pleased with the item."
4.0,Very beautiful ring! Shiny and elegant--but too small!  Make sure to order a bigger size! Had to return mine!
4.0,Nice belt!  I like it just fine except that the width of the faux leather tip is a bit wider than some of my belt loops making it hard to take off at airport security when I'm in a hurry.  I guess on those days I'll try to remember to wear a different belt!
4.0,I like the look n protects my watch
4.0,Cute purchased for granddaughter for playing dress up. Not the most easy or comfortable shoe.
4.0,"I got these for me. I like eeyore. These are huge, even for me! I am going to have to alter them for them to fit but they are really cute."
4.0,"Great compression. One size fits all. I have big calves and feel they run a little small on me, however I can still wear them.  I have other socks from nursemates and they fit well."
4.0,Got this pair of shoes for a very active 7 year old boy.  He is accustomed to ruining his shoes within a couple of weeks.  Its been 3 weeks and they are still in decent shape.  Lets hope this goes on.<br />My only concern so far is that the soles already look worn out.  I am not sure if its purely cosmetic or if they are in fact wearing out fast.  TI should find out in the next couple of weeks if holes appear...
4.0,"Very pretty and I get a lot of compliments on it, but the stones are jagged and snag on my clothes so I am always having to reposition it."
4.0,"The sunglasses have a nice dark polarized lens, and the frame is a very flexible almost rubberized type of plastic. Unfortunately, these did not fit my 2 year old daughter and I did have to return, so I cannot comment on the longevity of the product.<br /><br />Even although we did not use these, I am writing a review because of fit. My daughter is 2, and has a head circumference of 90% for her age, so I thought these would fit her without a problem. As stated above, the frame is very very flexible, but unfortunately that affected fit quite a bit. We have used frames that are the same size from Walmart of Target (the character ones that are hard plastic) and they fit fine, and I think it is because of the rigidity of the frame. Unfortunately, as soon as we put these on her, they fall right off, and because of the flexibility of the frame, there is nothing that can be bent, molded or tightened to fit to her face/head better. The shape of her nose is also more flat, which may contribute; the nose piece sticks very far up from her nose and didn't even make contact.<br /><br />I wanted these to work, but unfortunately they didn't. Hope the above helps anyone else looking to purchase. They seem great for the right kid. Our search continues...."
4.0,I bought the medium and it is true to size.  It lands just below my hips at the bottom. I wore it with a pair of jeans and it worked just fine.
4.0,"These are super cute, detailed and unique but I just wish the birds oval were ceramic or just not plastic. I know that would likely increase the cost and weight A LOT but maybe sell both versions? I’ve had several pairs of pearl earring from this brand and Love them but these look lux but just don’t have the lux weight."
4.0,The band is very comfortable and as most bands easy to attach to the watch.  The band kept the watch in place on my arm perfectly at first but after only a month or so it stretched to the point it did not.  I ordered the medium band and I may try the small to see if after it stretches it will fit like the medium did when new.
4.0,It'd be perfect if the top part of the heel is made of wood.  Fit as expected!
4.0,"It fits good to me the first item that arrived, the only thing I dislike, it was delivered to 1651 pentecost way not on 1623, i just track & find the door on the picture."
4.0,They are big for me but still very comfotable and i wear them every where.
4.0,It is more of a red than burgundy. I still wore it and it fits well
4.0,Really like it just wish it were smaller runs big
4.0,"It fit as expected, I got the medium size and my waistline is 32. It was very comfortable. The fabric was of good quality and it did not shrink nor did the color bleed when washed. It was also thick enough to keep you warm when worn outside. I got the navy blue with the two toned color but didn't quite like how it looked when worn. The single colored designs would have probably looked better on me. Over all the sweatpants was a fairly good and was nice to wear and of good quality and is worth its value.<br /><br />I received this product in exchange for an honest review."
4.0,"{update, wrong review on wrong product}<br />The quality seems to be good."
4.0,"I have to confess: I never saw a need for packing cubes. I mean, isn't my suitcase one big packing cube? However, after my boss talked about how much she loves them, I decided to give them a try. I'm now packing for the second trip I'm taking since getting them and I could not love them more. The cubes allow me to pack for each stop on my journey, and to separate my clothes by item and type. They allow me to roll clothes tighter, to pull things out of the suitcase only as I need them, and to stay organized throughout the journey. I also print labels that tell me what's in each cube at the beginning and the end of each trip. The beginning label tells me what's in each cube. The ending label tells me if the clothes in that cube are clean or dirty.<br /><br />My one complaint about these cubes is that, when they arrived, they were a bit dirty. It was as if they had been sitting in a warehouse unprotected. I had to clean them before I used them. Other than that, I love them."
4.0,great findings exactly as advertised.
4.0,"The ones I received are definitely not as nice/deep blue but I really like them! The swirls look 3D when you move. The 2gs *are* longer than necessary, at least for my ears, so they stick out a bit in the back but it's not terrible. You can even see how long they are in the advertised picture, so I shouldn't have been surprised."
4.0,Portable cushion - just what I needed for the low chair I have to sit in.
4.0,Very cute. Glad I ordered larger because it runs very small.
4.0,"Gives you the additional piece of mind, when you don't want to trust the zippers"
4.0,It was ok the only thing was too large.
4.0,"I like them, Good job!"
4.0,(Reviewed by my wife): This dress is mad of lightweight fabric that is comfortable and slightly stretchy.  The A-line shape is feminine and flattering (and forgiving in general).  The dress is loose fitting and flowy.  I like the pockets but they do make the hips stick out a little.  The uneven hemline is awesome and gives the dress a unique look.
4.0,"Nice bag, amazing shape - so many compartments! But, I have 2 reservations:<br /><br />1. The hardware is not silver as in the picture, but rather a brass color...<br />And<br />2. The smell. The bag smells like leather, treated leather. After the bag had a chance to air out a little the smell dissipated somewhat, but it is still partly there..."
4.0,"This is a VERY difficult item to find. Across the Internet, Amazon, & eBay there are many Gloria Vanderbilt & other competitive manufacturers who make variations of this style usually with at least one confusing, but important variation. This includes fabrics with different ratios of components and lack stretch qualities, slim leg versions passed off as straight leg models, zipper fronts, belt loops & below the waist fits. This Avery style (Not. Amanda) is the real thing!  It has all the virtues of the authentic original except one; NO BLACK COLOR!  This ink wash (the only one available) color just isn’t Black. Alas, it’s a salt & pepper insipid variation."
4.0,This is a really soft and comfy house slipper for a great price and I definitely recommend it!
4.0,The only reason why I knocked a str off it’s because of the white you can see on the sides of the band.<br />For the price it’s not too bad!
4.0,The first one broke the first week I had it. The second one broke when I accidently dropped it on the ground. I have had similar products in the past and they have last long periods of time. Not sure if I got a bad batch or if these are made SUPER cheap.
4.0,I gave two of these as gifts.  They were nicer looking in the picture than in person but the price wasn't bad.
4.0,Pleasantly surprised at the quality for the price.  It isn't as full and puffy as the picture but it feels like real fur.  Hardware  and leather is ok.
4.0,"The lei is very scratchy, could not wear it for very long."
4.0,"I like the style. Would buy another one , different color.  Comfortable"
4.0,"A bit on the heavy side so it wears hot when working in high temperature weather.  I am 6 ft tall 200lbs and the Large Long fit me well.  Overall, i am happy with the product."
4.0,"Nice material, good for the beach or play;"
4.0,Happy with the belt.
4.0,Very comfortable on the wrist. Felt tight at first but two fingers easily fits under the band. Need to be careful when putting the device in the brace. It looked too big but does fit in frame. Only suggestion would be a softer material
4.0,Muy bonito el estilo
4.0,I love the colors and design on the shirt. It fits tight though. I normally wear and medium and would have gotten a large on this.
4.0,Very nice quality and prompt shipping
4.0,"Comfy, stretchy, love the feel of the fabric and the packaging was very nice as well. Just wish it didn't smell like chemicals when it arrived I had to hang it up and febreeze over night before I could even get near it. Definitely recommend washing before wearing."
4.0,Happy well made
4.0,Super cute and light weight though smaller than I thought they'd be. That said I dont recall if the measurements are in the listing. If they hold through a night of dancing/drinking I'll order them in other colors!
4.0,"Love the hat, but material is not my favorite, wish it was cotton"
4.0,"I wish it had ""feet"" on the bottom to protect the bag underneath...other than that, I love it!"
4.0,Very flattering dress. But it is form fitting with material that's not super thick (which is good for hot weather but bad for hiding imperfections). A little long. I'm 5'2&#34; and it definitely lands right past my knees. Might get it hemmed but otherwise a really nice dress!
4.0,"Love this ring! Very simple, but elegant! Not over dressy & priced just right. Will B ordering the gold, it took longer 2 arrive than anticipated, but it was worth the wait! Highly recommend."
4.0,Great wallet for a guy who doesn't carry that many cards and only cash. Only problem is there's nonplace for change
4.0,"Super cute, looks as expected—-but really thin, not really a “sweater”…."
4.0,Seems to be as advertised.
4.0,My arms are average size  and this was a little tight in the arm area. I’m 5”7  & 190lbs with 38DD bust. I also would have preferred it be a little longer. I ordered a large but maybe an XL would’ve given me the look I was looking for.
4.0,Love the dress - nice satin material however tight on chest otherwise would fit good. A little tight in my shoulders.
4.0,"Cute, inexpensive, and fun!"
4.0,"I am 5'8"" and 150lbs, 36DD and this is large and frumpy on me, I really should have gotten a medium but I am going to wash it and try to shrink it. I thought it would be super soft but it really isn't. Maybe it will be softer after the wash."
4.0,"I wear size 11, and these are def snug. I am hoping they stretch a bit more to fit better. quite snug currently. but i do like the extra stability i get while on my mat!"
4.0,"Didn't care for the material or the tie in the front, returned."
4.0,I really do adore this ring... wished it would have been a tad bigger though. It feels and looks wonderful!
4.0,"Beautiful but broken can't wear it. The clap ,on the back does not work"
4.0,"marvellous fit, great color balance, shades my eyes above and to the side from direct sunlight"
4.0,Nice and good price. satisfied
4.0,"I really like this top. I bought white for a specific outfit, but I would like to buy one in another color (I tend to spill)."
4.0,"It’s comfortable, but a little weird and didn’t fit quite right. It is hard to move my arms"
4.0,Love this dress and price is crazy cheap. Fits well and I have large breasts. Looked very fitted and classy and sexy. First time ever prime was delayed for me so it arrived the day of my function and I had to go through a lot to get it and hem it in my hotel room.<br /><br />Has a train that needed to be cut off. I have this dress in red already.  I knew it would fit so I ordered the black. Prime was delayed so I had to leave the fancy hotel I was staying in and go back to get the dress off my doorstep the day of my event.
4.0,"Wanted these pretty tea party hats for my daughter to use in her photo sessions.<br />In the picture...ruffled brim.Not what i got,""flat all around""and colors were not mixed as in picture.They are cute but not what i was expecting.[[ASIN:B003ZAH4YM Girls Tea Party Hat Mix (4 pc)]]"
4.0,"Too small for 'one size fits all'.  Liked and wanted to ware, but was too small and gave as a gift. I don't have chubby fingers, the size is for skinny teenagers"
4.0,"This wig fit my almost 8 year old perfectly!  Shipping was quick, and the quality and price was great!  The only reason I didn’t give it 5 stars is because I would have liked it to be more of a bright blonde color like Tinker Bell’s, but is more of a yellow color."
4.0,"Nice earrings, a little bigger than what I was looking for, but they are nice"
4.0,"Bought these for my son. One broke in two days and the other is still holding up nicely. Nothing special, just a leather rope wrap."
4.0,"The picture is a little misleading, in person it looks more like costume jewelry or something a younger kid would wear. They are cute but not quite what I was expecting. They aren't as delicate looking in person"
4.0,"When I first opened the package I tried one on and it was a little small but after wearing the first pair for a day, my feet were molded into the slipper and is still very comfortable so I'm still satisfied with my purchase. I think I was expecting more fur and a little more space from the back of the slipper to my heel."
4.0,"This product basically served its purpose, which was for an 80's party."
4.0,the red dye came off on my neck
4.0,"Less a key chain and more a dagger with how big it is. Nicely made for how cheap it is, but It'd probably be better as a little dodad hanging from your backpack then a key chain."
4.0,Great material and price. Fit good on myself and my husband.
4.0,"Hey girls! I ordered this dress for my graduation ceremony. The dress is really beautiful and elegant and fit perfect. The fabric is comfy and high quality! Looked just like the pictures!<br />My only complaints would be that the neckline is a little higher than I wanted, fabric hugs your neck. And the back is see through, nothing spandex can’t fix though!<br /> I am 5’5” I weight 145lbs and I ordered a small. I do have a smaller chest.<br />I definitely recommend!"
4.0,"The necklace is beautiful! Unfortunately, a pearl was broken off the clasp so I returned it."
4.0,"Not as rose as it is gold - fits larger than I expected. Still, very pretty."
4.0,"they are what they say, compression socks. I wish they were a bit taller though they don't come all the way to the bottom of my knee"
4.0,Bought these for a concert. They were great. Got alot of compliments.
4.0,"Loved the color, but it fit a little tighter than I would have liked it to fit."
4.0,"The quality of the band is great, and the leather is nice. I can’t speak on the durability yet because I haven’t had it long enough. The gold matches my gold stainless steel series 4 watch perfectly—you can barely tell a difference in the colors. I would have liked the brown color to be a little deeper, but other than that it’s a great band. Just placed an order for a black one."
4.0,"I love this dress, but it was enormous on me! I sent it back and plan to re-order a smaller size. Overall the material is sturdy and comfy and it is just as cute in person."
4.0,"Sunew Non Slip Grip Yoga Socks are made in China of 76% cotton, 21% polyester and 3% spandex.  They are thin and moisture absorbent.<br /><br />The style is very cute with foldover elastic on the edges opened to full length for crisscross straps.  The stretchy sock material is glittery which I thought would be annoying against skin but the inside is softer so they are comfortable.<br /><br />Sunew Yoga Socks are neatly sewn and the non-slip bottoms work as expected to grip the floor.  They are attractive socks."
4.0,It doesn't catch and lays flat nicely.
4.0,It works. However you can not pull it down far because it is made tight around the band area.  It is cutie and warm
4.0,"cute, not fantastic quality."
4.0,It is too tight
4.0,"Cheap quality, but I like the look a lot. There's a zipper that goes across the stomach so you can wear them as shorts, which is cool I guess, but the zipper opens every time I walk or make any movements. Fixed it with a safety pin. I popped a button off the second time I wore them.  Ships from China."
4.0,"My glasses came with UV protection, however, they did not come polarized as advertised. Well, for the money they are very good."
4.0,Nice shirt but description said short sleeve and I received long sleeve...
4.0,"Beautiful- looks just like the photo and overall happy with the purchase. Wish the ribbon were longer though. Im not at all overweight and at 8 months pregnant, theres hardly any slack left over after its tied."
4.0,Very nice sweater but next time i will order a medium. The material very soft and nice though very good buy.
4.0,Used to wear this type of sock with my military boots when I was in the Air Force. Bought 4 pair of these to wear as boot socks in the Timberland Wellington 12W boots I bought on Ebay last spring. I have large wide feet so this kind of sock is the only kind that I can wear and still slide a pair of boots on. Washed all 4 pair in cold water with Tide detergent pods. Did not notice any shrinkage. Will wear these socks when the weather gets colder.
4.0,"I ended up returning it, but if it had fit in the sleeves I would have kept it. Very cute shape and I love the pattern. The fabric is pretty light, I would wear a cami and some shorts or a slip under it. It's short but fine for a day out... I probably wouldn't have worn it to work without leggings."
4.0,Easy to remove links and size to fit. The tool that it comes with to remove the links is a huge time saver and works for other similar watch bands too. The instructions to put it on can be found on youtube and is easy to follow. Would recommend.
4.0,"As you can see, there is a thread of my sweater on the band. That’s the only think that irks me. Price is okay and the magnetic capability of the band is good."
4.0,These look as good on my kids'ears as they do in the web display. Was surprized by how big the stones were and that the earrings were still balanced from end to end in weight. My two kids were fighting over them wanting to be the first to wear them to school. Cute little earring tote and packaged well for protection. Kudos to how fast they arrived at my home.
4.0,"Nice fabric, well made. A bargain for sure."
4.0,Smaller than i expected.  The back light only illuminates half the watch.  Inexpensive watch.  Should do what i need it to do.
4.0,I love the material  I bought dark red It's lighter than dark red in the don't try it in the dryer  Or it will get a lot of statics Not  Easy to get the statics out your bully a from aside the static start from other side other than that I love you I like the material as I said
4.0,Watch was a bit big
4.0,"I mainly got these shirts for running or wearing in the sun or as a baselayer. They are fine. They are not particularly flattering and I will probably feel self conscious wearing them as a solo layer. Something about where the seems hit. They are warm, if that is what you are looking for. Not sure how I would feel about them in the hot sun, as I wore one as a baselayer for snowshoeing and got super sweaty. They are fine for running.<br /><br />They are not itchy. They are not particularly soft, either. The colors are good. Okay for the price, so overall I am satisfied."
4.0,I really do love this dress. The material was so much nicer than expected. Very soft and not at all see through. I’m 5”4 135lbs. The length was perfect. My only negatives were the arms. They are a bit tighter than I like and come about 3 inches from my wrist.
4.0,So it's a super cute product but I didn't read the sizes correctly so it was way too big for my little girl. That said we still used it for a trip to the Outer Banks and it kept her head covered and she was still cool so it worked out.
4.0,"beautiful piece. the chain is not dainty as in would like my chains to be, but still beautiful."
4.0,Like theses but the queen was too big for me.
4.0,My first pair of compression stockings and so far so good! I may be on my feet anywhere from 2 to 8 hours a day on a concrete floor and as I have gotten older this has taken its toll. I have been wearing the stockings for about a week and I can really feel the difference at the end of the day. My legs are not as tired or achy. I would recommend the stockings.
4.0,"I requested these boot waders for a fly fishing trip in Colorado.<br />The waders themselves were constructed very well and held up to multiple days of fishing in various river and lake conditions. All of the seams were tight, there were zero leaks, the suspenders provided sufficient support and showed no signs of future wear.<br />I requested the size 14 since this was a trip for wounded warriors and I wanted it to be able to fit various men and women. I’m glad I did because we had no issues with anyone wearing it, even people with smaller shoe sizes.<br />These are a great value as well for the quality craftsmanship and materials.<br />I am however going to give this four stars instead of five, because it doesn’t have any decent pockets. The pocket on the front provides no type of flap or closure to prevent items from falling into water if you were to slip, plus it’s convenient to have several pockets on waders when you are out on the water to carry extra items like a lure  box or a hook removal tool etc.<br />In conclusion,<br />I want to emphasize that this particular item was provided to me at no cost through Amazon’s Vine program.<br />Vine reviewers aren’t actually employed by Amazon, as such we don’t receive monetary compensation for reviewing the items provided to us and we are responsible for any applicable taxes.<br />As an incentive for us providing its customers with TRUE and AUTHENTIC feedback good or bad based on our experiences using the products Amazon does allow us to keep the items after Reviewing.<br />This is Amazon’s way of helping its customers make better informed decisions about the products in which they are about to pcurchase.<br />I would also like to make it clear wthat I’m not employed by any other sellers, manufacturer’s or advertisers.<br />So I sincerely hope this gives you peace of mind that all of my ratings are credible, having not been influenced in any way by outside sources and based solely on my personal opinions.<br />Thank You!"
4.0,Little bit short above the ankle it is maxi dress should be below ankles
4.0,Nice Socks!  Better quality than I expected.
4.0,I like the comfort and the size in covering your face. Seems a bit thin for true safety. I like that it does not have thin ties to attach around your ears. They are washable so you get longer useful life.
4.0,Quality comfort
4.0,"I was happy it was well made - not cheap.  It is too tight in the bust for me, but I'm a bit bigger due to the Covid Spread so it should be fine once I lose a few pounds.  I hand wash and it comes out looking very nice.  Love that it was shipped from US so I did not have to wait for 4 or 5 weeks to receive it."
4.0,"This dress is super comfortable.  The material is a little bit thin.  I bought it in black, but it is more of an olive green - which I actually really like.  I wish I had gotten one size smaller (I bought a medium - should have gotten a small), but it still fits fine."
4.0,"The shirt fits as expected (for my boyfriend) and the material is very comfortable. But the print is not as shown as the picture (brightness of colors). The picture I took myself even looks better than looking at it in person. It's not bad at all, the colors could simply be a lot more vibrant."
4.0,I ordered a large as I always do. The shoulders slide off all day and constantly showing bra strap .
4.0,Material is easy to be ruin
4.0,"I love the variety and color mix.  I wish they were a little bigger and a little softer. But overall, great buy!"
4.0,"They’re pretty good for the price. Don’t think they will last long, but will keep baby from getting bruised knees."
4.0,This is a great towels for kids up to 7. It's a decent size but not as big as I though it was going to be. Decent material for the price.
4.0,"The shape and size of these glasses are great! They're comfy and not too tight around the temples, but they also won't slide down your nose. They are clearly polarized, but I'm returning them because they just aren't dark enough. I get migraines and have a love/hate relationship with the sun and these don't cut it for me. If you don't mind them being a little lighter then these would probably be an excellent choice for you."
4.0,The socks were smaller that expected
4.0,"These fit really well, pretty true to size.  They're comfortable and dry quickly.  You can see through them a bit when they're wet, so if you're very modest or there's strict decency laws in your area, wear something under them in public.  Otherwise, I have no complaints.  Love them."
4.0,Love these took awhile to recv but worth it
4.0,Little long but fit nicely. They look really good in person and the velcro is strong.
4.0,"BEAUTIFUL!! So comfy. I had to hem it because I am so short, but for someone taller than my 4’9 frame it would be better. Lol I still love it and it’s my favorite maxi dress. Great quality but still lightweight and airy."
4.0,It does run small so order one or two sizes up. I'm 6ft 175lbs and in American sizes I normally wear a size 12. I ordered a 2x Navy Blue  i because I wanted a baggy look and it was perfect fitting just like the picture. Yes it is thin but perfect for warm weather and a casual fit.
4.0,Ordered this for my mom and she loves it! Pretty!
4.0,"I called the manufacturer prior to purchase, and received measurements in inches. Unfortunately, the measurement was an outside measurement and the slippers did not fit. The sales material did not state a shoe size."
4.0,"it's long, but it's nice."
4.0,"I ordered a 3X, my measurements are 20 pant size, 40 bust, 5'9 and typically an 18 in a dress. I really like this dress; it's comfortable, nothing feels tight, it feels like it fits well. For me personally, if I wear the right shapewear, it would look a little better fitting in me.<br /> I also love the length; I have a booty, so skirts and dresses always lift up more in the back for my liking (plus I have longer legs too) This dress is long enough to where I don't feel like I have to pull at the hem to make sure it's not coming up too short in the back.<br /><br />The lace is not as soft as I would like, so I do have a little bit of concern about my arms getting a little irritated from running against the lace.<br /><br />Overall, happy with purchase."
4.0,"I bought a larger size, thinking dresses are usually too small when they arrive. This one was actually too big. Order your right size and it will fit great. I wore a shirt underneath and it was a great summer work dress."
4.0,Great eperience
4.0,dont like that the brand logo is heavily put on the back of the glasses but still great sunglasses
4.0,"I  purchased this dress for my daughter.  It fits her well, but she said she will need to wear white Nike pro shorts or something similar under it"
4.0,"i'm not going to say it runs small - i just don't think it's really meant for the curvy, probably prefers a bit more of a narrow or less 'figure 8' - but whatever size is the best for you - it is gorgeous!!!  it'll be late fall or winter before i wear this one out but i look forward to it.  a couple things ... 1) the lace around the waist/middle section, there's nothing behind it.  it's not revealing at all but should be noted that it's an open lace.  2) zipper stops around the waist.  this isn't a huge thing but because it runs a bit narrow bust to waist, i actually had to pull this one from above and down vs stepping into it.  really just kind of dictates when i do my hair and make-up during the get ready process.  i think just start with your regular size - via the vine process i was offered the 12, and really know i should have gotten a 14.  i can get into it - but it's equivalent to having to jump into a pair of jeans but there's no stretch.  who knows - maybe i'll keep losing weight and look amazing by fall and be able to wear this with comfort and ease ... that's the plan."
4.0,"Solid product for the price. I was mainly looking for something to block my eyes from the wind, and they're great at that. Don't get fogged up on rides, but do smudge easily."
4.0,"These are comfy, warm, pretty....but today as I wore them for maybe the 4th or 5th time, I noticed a hole at the base of one of the fingers which I will need to mend. Way too soon for that to be okay...<br /><br />I am adding this a few weeks later to say how happy I am that the seller replaced the gloves quickly. I am hoping these will stay in better shape, and will update this review as I find out."
4.0,"This is a super cute little bracelet.  It is very simple, just a little rope for the bracelet part and a little charm but the card included and the nice box makes it giftable"
4.0,"This is a perfect ugly sweater, and surprisingly warm. The mink texture, also makes it quite novel from knit Christmas sweaters.<br /><br />Only criticism is that the sleeves could be slightly longer, I don't have long arms, but I imagine this would run short on people who do."
4.0,Is good quality
4.0,Could have been better
4.0,Just what I needed but I paid extra to overnight this item and it didn't come on time. Paid extra money for nothing and didn't have it for the event that I purchased it for. Product is just as described and I'm excited to use it for future shoots.
4.0,"Very cute dress, I love the length. You can comfortably wear it with heels or flats. I'm 5'5 and got the XL for my baby shower because of the style, but if an XL normally fits you then it's still completely fine. My only complaint is that the fabric isn't as soft as you'd hope and wrinkles easily. So just make sure to hang it when its fresh out of the dryer and you will be fine."
4.0,Top grade material...fits perfect.
4.0,"Easy to switch out, and I'm sure they would scratch just like the original lenses. Especially when they have an extremely thin reflective coating. Optically they are correct with no distortion. So far I've been pleased with them. Plus, I am a little more careful about using the case or where I set them down."
4.0,Works fine. No leak issues so far. Though we have used other better Aegend goggles before. Color from the edges of glass is also coming off..
4.0,"The colors are nice as well as the material but the cut is definitely not for a curve women.  I return my order because of the size .  However, the outfit is nice."
4.0,I like the colors and the quality seems to be good. They are shinier than I expected but will work fine.
4.0,The mediums ran a bit too long. Nothing a hem wont fix. The Fit is great everywhere else and these are super comfy!
4.0,GOOD cheap rain coats.
4.0,Fit like a glove... the description said it wouldn't fit my serial number. After watching a YouTube video I decided to try anyway and I didn't have to do the modifications taught in the video. Just removed the old and installed the new. A bit cheaper made but it looks nice and fit well.
4.0,"cute dress, not the greatest quality but did the job. my 4 year old loved it for Valentine's day"
4.0,"This is a generously sized bag made of high quality leather. The muted gold finish is tasteful. Two complaints:  the liner is awkward- it would be much more useful if it was permanently attached inside the bag. And the straps are stiffer that the body of the purse and stand at attention!! Other than that, I'm very pleased with this purchase- enough that I bought a second for my daughter."
4.0,I love the look of the purse. The middle compartment doesn't extend all the way to the bottom but it is very classy looking and well built.
4.0,I love it. Only issue I had was I ordered the footless one and got the one with the feet. I'm still happy with the product though.
4.0,"battery last around 2 weeks on average.  tracks everything my wife wants.  It's been on many runs, workouts, painting sessions with her.  the battery life is the best thing."
4.0,"Fit as expected,  just unsure how to wash them. Nice feel and they look great,  very comfortable and very fashionable"
4.0,Good fitting shirt
4.0,"This dress was better than i expected! Good quality material, as pictured, very pretty.<br />The only issue i has was it was too long for myself, and i needed some double sided tape but with a little heming it will be perfect."
4.0,Not as comfortable as I initially expected it to be but does it's job well. Minor issues with the seat shifting mid ride.
4.0,"I like quality , color.  was very disappointed because it was too small for me"
4.0,It is a one size fits all and so on me it is a little large. Typically I wear medium shirts sometimes large .  It is a coverup though and can be oversized :)
4.0,Great for dance class! Simple & comfortable
4.0,I’m very impressed by this product
4.0,"Seems fine for the price, the band is pretty stiff, more plastic like then flexible rubber, hopefully it losesn up w time."
4.0,Keychaon is very cute
4.0,my daughter ordered this its just a cheap necklace shipped within a reasonable time
4.0,"This umbrella is good to cover a lot of space to keep you dry, and Is fairly lightweight.  I recommend it for rain showers that don’t include wind.<br />My wrist gets fatigued when it’s windy bc the wind moves the umbrella to and fro. I have to hold on farther up the spine of the umbrella Just to keep from being tossed about if a big wind comes in winter.<br />Other umbrellas architecture are built to deal specifically with winds, this one is not.  I still use it I’m just attentive to the type of weather to know which umbrella to use.  I have a few different types.<br />Again, it’s very wide and you’ll stay dry if it’s just raining, so I’d recommend for that.<br />For more wintery weather probably look elsewhere.<br />It comes in a nylon case that has a nylon handle you can put over your shoulder to carry around.  For those who’d carry the umbrella around this can be a perk."
4.0,My wife likes it :)
4.0,Nice glasses for a great price.
4.0,"Great value and the product is quality standard.  1 of the straps broke right away,, but put a stitch in and all has been well.  Color tones nice!"
4.0,"Soft, cozy, and great fit."
4.0,the arms on this dress were tight like they weren't made to go with the rest of the dress so I did alter it and now the dress has short sleeves. but other than that I like it.
4.0,This is a very nice shirt but it runs large. It's made in Bangladesh and I received it around the time of the clothing factory collapse there. I hope there new unions will put an end to all the deaths.
4.0,Its a nice shirt - color isn't as bright as shown on the screen
4.0,"Hers and her watch , very nice"
4.0,Were great when received but 1 plug in for charging the lights broke off within 2 weeks.
4.0,I like it and very comfortable. Color was nice and bright.
4.0,"Great fit, wash well.  A really good buy."
4.0,"I’ve had mine two years so far.  I like the bright yellow color, easy auto open and it’s held up well."
4.0,"Love the look, fit of this tee.  I would have given it 5 stars but FIR is spelled wrong!  Still cute!"
4.0,Bought it for my wife she loved it. Very nice and it did fit her pandora bracelet
4.0,"I usually wear a large, I got this in Medium and it was still a little large. So, buy smaller."
4.0,"Ordered earrimgs for a certain outfit, and they are just as they appear in line. Pleased with  how they fit on ear, and visual appearance is as lovely as I expected."
4.0,"I am 5'8&#34; and 118 lbs.  I ordered a size small and it fits perfectly.  It's not baggy but not tight.  The peplum hem falls at just the right place on my waist and is quite flattering.  The material is almost like a light sweater, which is different than what I expected but I like it.  I ordered the beige floral print, and I just ordered the navy floral also since I like this one so much."
4.0,"Not sure, but they all seem to have extra long sleeves. Love everything about them."
4.0,"I got this for our choir's first in-person performance since the pandemic  It's soft & lightweight, so while the cloth does move in when you inhale, the seamed design keeps it from getting into your mouth. Since I'm fully vaccinated and it was a hot sunny day, the light material was very comfortable and adequate for the occasion."
4.0,"All in all, good necklace!!! Just the chain it very cheaply... Like plastic."
4.0,I’m usually a large but I ordered a medium and it was a teeny bit snug but it hugged my curves perfectly. I probably could’ve done a large but I did like the way the dress fit over all.
4.0,"This robe is very warm and very comfortable.  I like the way it feels, it looks nice when you roll up the cuffs to reveal the black lining.  The grey and black contrast itself is very nice.  However, as much as I like it, rolling up the sleeves is part of the problem I have with this robe.  The sleeves are a little, just a little short as it is.  That's not good.  A slightly longer sleeve would probably make me love this robe.  Again, rolling up the sleeves does make it look better and if the sleeves were longer it would also feel better.  But they're not.  Bottom line is the sleeves are too short for my liking.  If they were longer I would probably really, REALLY love this robe: but they're not.  So I don't even love the robe that much.  I do like it though.  Too bad about the sleeves.  The guy modeling the robe in the picture either has short arms, or he's really tall, takes a larger size and the larger size has longer sleeves, maybe I got a defective robe, I don't know.  but the sleeves are too short on mine.  (If the sleeves were longer, 5 stars would understate my rating of it.)<br /><br />In another review here, someone says that it is a cat hair magnet.  I don't have a cat.  I do have a dog that sheds though and the hair I find on it is negligible.  I'm talking one or two hairs here and there, maybe three at most.  So, cat hair, I don't know, kinda doubt the guy just made that up:  excessive static electricity problem in his home?  I don't know, but my dog's hair doesn't stick to it that much.  (I could tell you about some cotton sheets I own that attract the dog's hair like crazy, and another set, also 100% cotton that doesn't attract it at all, so go figure.)  I hope this review has been helpful in your arriving at a decision.  Again, great robe to a good extent.  I think I mentioned the problem I have with it once or twice though already."
4.0,"I am 5’4, 27” waist, 37” hips and I bought a small. I’m usually a medium in leggings you might buy from Target, but I’m glad I took everyone’s advice and sized down. They aren’t restrictive or too constrictive. I have short legs and I don’t have to roll them up! They aren’t even fully past my ankle either which I looooove.<br />Docked one star bc the color is not what I ordered. I wanted the berry colored one. I was sent something similar, but it’s def not what is shown."
4.0,Fits a tad small.
4.0,Maybe it's my fault but i always fit in 3x and sometimes 2x so I figured a 3x in this would fit perfectly. Unfortunately for me I have to alter it for it to fit. Also the belt is not thick enough to properly define my waist/bust I reccomend a 4 in ribbon I believe this is a 2 in. Again could be my fault for being bigger. I do reccomend this dress to anyone who can normally fit into 1x - 2x and smaller. If you're normally a 3x unfortunately it might be too small without alterations.
4.0,"I bought these to use as part of a cosplay, and they were great!  The length is exactly as pictured. They did a fair job of staying up on my thin arms, though I had them layered over sleeves, so I can't really say how the gloves would perform on bare skin.  If I were shopping for formal wear, I'd skip these only because the finger tips are a little boxy from how the seams are sewn, but they were great for costume wear.<br /><br />I knocked off a star because when I got home and removed the gloves, a good amount of black fabric dye had transferred to my skin on my hands and especially my fingertips.  I wore them for about 2.5 hours, they did not get wet, my hands did not sweat so far as I noticed; so I'm not sure why I had an issue with dye.  However---for the price, I would definitely buy them again for cosplay use."
4.0,"Much thinner than I would have liked unfortunately. Defeats the purpose of a cough / face mask. I wear it over top my N95, more of an aesthetic thing I guess, so the N95 isn't seen. (I work in health care, that's why I wear a N95)"
4.0,"Comfortable, loved the pockets. The colors were brighter than I expected. I am 5’5” 180 pounds I bought a size large, it fit loosely."
4.0,"So the baby booties are just as pictured and seem to be good quality. My only issue is that they are not newborn sized. More like 3-6 month sized. They are super cute though, so I’ll just have to wait until my daughter is bigger to have her wear them. They did hold up going thru the washer and dryer just fine though (I washed them when I first received them)."
4.0,"These sunglasses sit comfortably on my face. They aren’t heavy. They come with a storage bag, and even a warranty.  I love the look of them. There is only one thing I’m not crazy about, the word sunglasses being on my sunglasses."
4.0,"The XXL fit like an XL so now my husband can’t wear it. Guess we’ll save it in case he loses weight. Buy one size larger if you can. It looked nice, otherwise."
4.0,"I ordered 6 swimsuits and this was my favorite. It looks nice and holds up well. Great find and reasonably priced!<br /><br />Update: I downgraded to 4 stars. While I still think it's a worth-while purchase, I will say that as I've worn it maybe a dozen times it's starting to be see-through at the top. I bought the white top black bottom so the white part is becoming more transparent. It comes with inserts (which are white) for the bra area but they are very cheap and easy to see through the top now. It's not so bad that I don't ever wear it, but it's enough that it's now a back-up suit compared to my regulars. I have a pool so it's good to have it but I won't be wearing it to any parties anytime soon."
4.0,"A very attractive rose gold finish chronograph with a sweep center seconds chronograph hand.  The center chronograph seconds hand appears to step at about 5 steps per second so I am calling this a 1/5 second resolution chronograph.  4 stars due to the included ""universal manual"" not including this chronograph dial configuration and no specifications for any of the watches it supposedly covers.  The watch seconds hand is the small bottom sub dial hand which steps at the usual quartz watch 1 second intervals.  Actual case diameter is just over 42mm and the claimed diameter in the listing includes the crown setting knob thickness so a fairly large, but not ridiculously so, watch. A domed crystal without anti reflection coating.  The band is substantial leather but I will be replacing it with a rose gold metal band.  The back is circular and held on by 4 mini Philips screws rather than being screw-on which makes me wonder about the claimed 100 meter water resistance."
4.0,Love the fabric and lettering. This is a very comfortable and breathable material. I would go a size up if you want it to look like the girl in the photo as it does room a little small and gets a little smaller after first washing.
4.0,I like that it has a slot for bills. It gets a little bulky when all slots are filled but overall it is very functional.
4.0,"I ordered a large based on the reviews. I am personally very happy with my decision though I wish this was a little bit longer. I’m 5’2 and it’s a little short on me, but not unwearable. The color is great and the fabric is breathable. Not a bad buy!"
4.0,Good price but runs a little big in the waist.
4.0,Beautiful!!! Fits as expected. I ordered the wrong size and had a replacement size in 2 days and on a Sunday! I highly recommend
4.0,Only thing I have a problem with is the martini glass on one pair as they are for little girls.
4.0,Grandson would have to tell you about how wonderful it is as was bought as gift for him.
4.0,This fit perfectly everywhere except the elastic across the back; that was a bit too big so I just tightened it a little bit myself. Some of the sewing seems to not be of the highest quality but it's not falling apart or anything. It looks super cute on.
4.0,"I ordered two of these in two different colors and sizes. I recommend sizing one up and belting it or passing altogether because the actual fit on these is really loose and billowy, but they're VERY short--as in I'm 5'2&#34; and have to wear something under them or I'll show the universe my shanaynay. The colors are also slightly more muted than I was expecting, but they're ridiculously comfortable. And most importantly, they have pockets. I adore pockets."
4.0,Cute and fit my curvy figure
4.0,Very good my wife loved it it was a birthday present
4.0,The fabric was as expected. Polyester and rough to the touch but we were going for a look and didn't put stock ink the feel of it.<br />We got an xlarge thinking we needed to order a size up just in case and we could alter it if it were too big but it was still a little too small with no extra fabric tho let it out some. Over all it was decent for the price.<br />I also found that steaming it with my iron worked better than straight out ironing it and I would recommend ironing it inside out so you don't melt the sheen on the outside.
4.0,"I liked this sweater but it is very boxy, I like to push up the arms of my sweaters and it is pretty Loose which I know means they won’t stay up. Fabric is heavier, but I really like the colors and it falls off my shoulder. I bought the burgundy/ animal print. It was great for the price."
4.0,"I'm a 5'8&#34; athletic built female and I was swimming in the size medium. My 6'3&#34; 200 lb husband could have worn it, but the body was a touch too small. That said the quality is great. It was a nice thick substantial sweatshirt."
4.0,"Like the look of this necklace once I get it on. I would have preferred a different type of clasp though. It isn’t easy to hook at all. Perhaps a bit larger one would have been easier to secure and remove…,"
4.0,"I love these!  So unique, i think you can put prescription lenses in...."
4.0,"I finally, after much deliberation, bought this dress. As I pushed the purchase button, terror set in because as a curvy beauty, not fat, but curvy, I was afraid of it not fitting. I waited a few days, still terrified, and it came. I  took it out if the package, and left it draped across the bed for at least a hour, until I mustered up the courage to put it on. Its beautiful! The arms are a smidge too tight but I'll deal, I'm sure. I ordered 3x because I'm amply designed in the boobs and hip department, and it was very fitted. 42 bust, 36 waist, and 47 hip. Don't know if this review will help other curvy beauties decide, but I love this dress...apart from the small arm holes 😏"
4.0,Nice for dress up
4.0,Good to normal quality as far as reef sandels go. The size was slightly smaller however they weren't drastically to the point that I couldn't wear them. They also did not have the best comfort but were still fine for an occasional wear
4.0,"Looks great, cheap. 4 stars cuz it is hard to adjust the band. The inside pins in the band are sometimes rusted. I have bought 2 of these. No one can tell its cheap."
4.0,Fits better than expected. Soft material
4.0,I love that it has pockets.
4.0,Got this for my 2 yrs old daughter...material is okay...not great...it fit her a little too big but I also got it 1 size bigger...overall...its okay and it's what I expected for the amount paid.
4.0,Wife loved them for Christman
4.0,Overall very happy with purchase! Fits nicely. Product as described. Timely shipping.
4.0,"Very cute style, but runs oversized in both size and length."
4.0,Smaller than I had hoped but it still worked out.
4.0,"The hat is exactly what is pictured and fits well, it just took several weeks before it got here. I emailed the seller after a couple of weeks and they did respond which was nice. As long as you do not need this hat soon, its fine."
4.0,Hi guys<br />I want to share my experience with you about this item.<br />Good points:<br />1.it’s beautiful cateye sunglasses<br />2.well designed<br />3.fits good<br />4.comfortable<br />Bad points:<br />1.quality is medium<br />2.it doesn’t have any case
4.0,The sizing was complicated with converting cm to inches. But it will be fine since its for a costume. Nice quality
4.0,Extent for the buck  thanks
4.0,small fitting but it is a beautiful blouse
4.0,being on my feet all day this really helped
4.0,The product was really nice.
4.0,Really nice pair of earrings for every day wear
4.0,"This is a wonderful bag, and I really wanted to love it. My fault for not fully considering the measurements. It looks much more expensive than the price I paid for it. Unfortunately for me, the bag was not quite wide enough to hold my work laptop and all of the other things that I need to carry with me on a normal workday. I also found the shoulder straps to be just a little bit too short. If they came out with a larger version, I'd buy one in a second! This one, sadly, had to be returned."
4.0,"Beautiful mask but came defected. There was one black rhinestone instead of white in the middle of the mask, so it looks like a dirt."
4.0,"Like the colors and patttern on this. I didn’t love the feel of the material and returned. I also expected/hoped for a little more length based off the model pic. Love rbx tops, be happy if more were released in longer lengths"
4.0,"This gloves look amazing and feel amazing. They are a little bit snug in the fingers near the top knuckles, but not uncomfortable. When I need another pair of gloves, I will buy from here again."
4.0,Basic shirt whats not to like?
4.0,"Beautiful swimsuit.. Very low cut, but, very flattering at the same time."
4.0,"The actual gem is different from the picture, not the exact design but not too much to claim a return. I really enjoy this necklace, very shiny & easy to hook on ,unlike most necklaces."
4.0,"My mother is often somewhat reclined when she eats.  If we secure the bib with the Velcro fasteners and don't shift the bib back a bit, she sometimes gets food on the neckline of her shirt because the neck hole of the bib hangs low.<br />I have used bleach on tough stains on the bib, and they have come out."
4.0,Looks great but the color is rubbing off after wearing for awhile. Other wise it would be 5 stars.
4.0,"These are my first polarized glasses so don't have anything to compare them to however my friends' polarized glasses do seem different. These sometimes give me a headache but it's very possible it's just me. They look almost pink when you look through them. BUT, I've gotten soooo many compliments on them and I do love how they look. Very cool!"
4.0,GREAT ITEM--THANKS
4.0,"By I was really disappointed with this item because I really was in love but it runs really big so go down 2 or 3 sizes. I plan on reordering it for Christmas just hope that they have a XSmall. I'll add to my list and hopefully, my husband will reorder it for me again. Review written By Ruthanne purchased on my husband account<br />[[ASIN:B01MFFKI8Z JJ Perfection Women's Asymmetric Drape Open Front Long Cardigan MAUVE L]]"
4.0,Bit on the short side (I'm 5'8&#34; 140lbs) but nice. Comes out very wrinkled after dryer tho. Needs iron or hang drying with weights.
4.0,"Giving 4 stars for the struggle to get it set. Like most I was looking for a metal bracelet for my Casio MDV106. This looks and fits great. I did not have to adjust or do anything to make it seamless at the case. The only problem was getting it set in with the spring bars. It’s almost a half mm too long at the ends and you really have to push and almost bend the spring bars in to make it fit. Once it snaps in, you’re good to go. I love it and have had many compliments."
4.0,"This piece really looks gorgeous from a distance. Even the background is white, the upper crystal reflects different light colors when light hits on it.<br />But, maybe as the seller explained, due to the shipping carelessness, this piece has two nicks in the crystal and one on. It looks like that it gets dirty when looked closely. But the seller is responsible, they give me a little refund to compensate this drawback.<br />I think it still be a fair deal so I accepted it.<br />If it is shipped well, I highly commend this piece."
4.0,"Love this skirt the color and material are great, perfect fit."
4.0,I don’t like that the pack<br />rides up on my torso and I would prefer for it to have been a zippered pouch. The button is difficult to clasp without stopping and looking down.
4.0,Soft and fuzzy but not bulky
4.0,Color and details of item slightly different than expected.  Service was fast.
4.0,Elizabeth mcbride
4.0,"I ordered this for my husband as he seems to keep an open mind about alternative medicinal products. It came with a tool to adjust its links for sizing, and he seemed to have no issues adjusting it multiple times for use. He is also amused by checking to see what will stick to its magnetic nature... almost like a cat and a penlight.<br /><br />I am rating this four stars for his happiness with it. As always, your mileage and preferences may vary..."
4.0,Its a good dress but i am 5'8&#34; and curvy and tge drwss i i think is for shorter women cause it fits me to my knees..
4.0,"Good thing there's a lot of them.... they are great. Just like with any painted metal,  the paint chips off"
4.0,"Great costume for the price, ears aren’t made the best but for a night they’ll do."
4.0,"Color: Fshion Stripe<br />Purchased Size: Small<br />I am 5'5"", 135 lbs, and a 34D. I typically wear a standard, US women's size 4.<br /><br />This outfit was mostly true to size for me except I felt the top ran a bit large for my chest. I had the straps all the way tightened and was still not getting the support I needed. Things kept popping out if you know what I mean. I would have liked this better and kept it if the straps were convertible to crisscross or halter style. The straight spaghetti strap style did not work for me. As for the skirt, there is a sewn in brief that is the same print so everything below is covered and appropriate - the skirt was actually quite comfortable and fun to wear!<br /><br />I ended up returning this item because I could not get the top to fit correctly."
4.0,Nothing's wrong
4.0,"I purchased it too early my 2 1/2 year old wasn’t interested, maybe next Valentine’s Day ?"
4.0,No pink thread and the zipper is loose and dosent like to stay up but I rigged it with a rubber band and it fits perfect And fabric is stretchy 💕
4.0,just what I need after eye surgery
4.0,"Very cute, very simple, and at the same time stylish. I'm 5'6"" and 145. I bought a medium and it fits great.  The only complaint I have is the  design of the wrap.  First, you have to look very very closely to find the slit that allows for the string to wrap around you.  The photo shows how small the slit is. You can't even tell it's there, which is probably a good thing, but I was so close to returning it because I couldn't find it at first.  But once I found it, I was good.  Second, there isn't a backup clip, or button, or clasp to secure the wrap and keep it in place. This means you may have to have to wear something like a tank top underneath in case your string gets undone. I'm a little top heavy, so I decided to sew a small clasp on to the dress to secure it. If you're really thin it may not be a problem.  Outside of that, it's a lovely dress."
4.0,A great bathing suit for the price!
4.0,Cute and would be a fun pop of red! I was hoping for more dimension cut into the glass. Came off a little flat.
4.0,Not really my style but fits and looks as expected.  What can I say.  It is a shirt
4.0,"Actually does help, in my case a lot, with circulation issues & the foot swelling it causes. The difference is significant when I use them to when I dont. I especially notice when im working as I work sitting down for hours at a time. Have bought about 6 pairs. The only gripes I have is that the lenth is inconsistent between pairs by about an inch & that you have to be mindful to put the on correctly or you can rip them."
4.0,It fits great. Cannot see through when bending over and does not make you feel like sausage casing. I really like this product.
4.0,"This has been great! Took a bit to get used to it, but I've found this to be a great alternative to the traditional bi or tri fold wallet."
4.0,"The bag looks well made, is a good size without being too large, and the leather is soft and attractive. It converts easily to a backpack configuration. My only comment is that the blue is darker than the one shown online - more of a blue/gray than a robin's egg blue. Other than that we are very happy with the purchase."
4.0,"5'6&#34; 140lb<br />I am a size medium, but I bought a size large so it wouldn't be too tight. The fit is good, except that the torso doesn't have much shape. It needs to be taken in at the waist. I think I would have the same problem with a medium because of the cut, though maybe not so much. Otherwise the length, legs, and chest fit nicely. The material is a good quality. I bought a navy unitard and the color is nice. Not see through."
4.0,"This jumpsuit is beautiful and I love it, but it does not fit, according to the size listed for a 14 is XXL and it is small you must order a size larger. I had to return it, very disappointed!"
4.0,"These do NOT look like they do in the pictures..They are NOT that big & for sure they do NOT shine, sparkle, anything like what they are showing..They ARE pretty & I usually wear them & just leave them in coz they are pretty comfy..I like them"
4.0,i'm allergic to metal so this works for me.
4.0,"These are fun, festive socks that are perfect for the holiday.  They are comfortable to wear, with good elastic tops that stay put aren't so tight that they leave marks on your legs.  I have to hide these because my teen daughters like them and are likely to steal them from me."
4.0,"The dress arrived and it was so adorable,  I loved the style, length and the pockets.  But went I put it on and the sleeves were too tight and across the chest it also was  really snug."
4.0,Enjoy the way these feel. They were rather large.
4.0,Great product did not rate high because only received 2 of 3 pink
4.0,"Reviews said it ran small, which was perfect for me."
4.0,"Love them, perfect fit, great stiching. Great Fabric Quality"
4.0,"They are very nice shoes well made and light,but  a little on the small side.I should have ordered one size up;<br />The reason I gave it 4 stars is because the shipping time was very very slow but  for the price they are a bargain."
4.0,Hands of the watch are colored same as the face making the time almost impossible to read.  Anyone with vision<br />problems don't buy this watch.
4.0,These glasses are so cute! They appear to be very flexible and seem like they could take the abuse of a child handling them. They’re a little big for 2 and under but still good quality.
4.0,"I absolutely love this dress!  The only thing is, is that i ordered this dress in black and the top was supposed to be nude with black lace over it, the dress i received was the same dress except the top was black with black lace.  Luckily i ended up liking it better!"
4.0,Huge. Didnt realize how freaking big they are I got one for each kid and me for a trip all got filled half way.
4.0,The pendant itself is excellent. Love it.<br />But unfortunately the chain is cheaply made and too long even with adjustment loops. (chain in photo not the same) I will have to either re-chain or lace pendant some time soon for fear of it breaking.<br />Received item on time and price is very good.<br />Because pendant is nice and price was right I would definitely order from them again.
4.0,"This wearable blanket is SO comfortable!!  It's larger than I expected which makes it even better than I'd hoped.  It's warm and fuzzy and will be great for lounging around in on weekends during the cold winters.  I got this for myself but, I'm sure once my teenager see this I may have to get another one.  The only thing that I don't like is that the hood is too big.  It falls down over my eyes.  The material can be folded back though so I don't think it will be a big issue.  This is definitely a teenage - adult item due to the size.  Also, it holds up well after washing, which is important."
4.0,"what can i say, they're socks I do like them- they aren't super slippery and don't make the feet sweat- i wouldn't consider them athletic socks But they are comfy and are ok for wearing with sneaks or even a casual pair of shoes )i.e. they aren't super thick)<br />I washed and did notice some beading but nothing too horrible. For the price I would re-purchase"
4.0,I loved the colors and the pattern.  The fabric was a bit heavier than I wanted for summer.  It would look great in the fall with a jeans jacket or sweater.  The size was perfect.
4.0,"It's good for a short mile run. After that, it becomes harder to breathe due to the filter becoming wet from your perspiration. Also,the air valves could use an upgrade.  I had to use the spare after about my twelfth run."
4.0,Very nice piece of jewelry.  Quick  shipment.
4.0,Cute and stretchy. I like the way they fit.
4.0,"Very nice boot! The wool lining covers the entire inside of the boot, not just the shaft.  Appears to be very well made.  Wish they came in half sizes.  My husband wears a 9.5 US men's size and the 10 was a little too big."
4.0,"The only reason I didn’t give it 5 stars is because it’s not see thru sheer. It’s opaque and almost white on the inside. It’s not a lining or anything just sort of white. I’m going to keep it because I still like it and it fits well, it’s made well, etc. I just wish it was more sheer"
4.0,This product is made for short people.
4.0,Good quality but fit only women with perfect body..
4.0,"I've only had a chance to wear them a couple of times at night, but so far I like the glasses.  One night it was raining and the glasses actually helped with the glare from the lights and reflections off the rain.  The lenses are a bit bigger than I thought they'd be but I'm getting used to them.  I chose these frames because the lenses looked smaller than the ones in the second frames.  Now, I kind of wish I would have chosen the other frames.  But overall, they're pretty good.  The delivery was really fast too."
4.0,"I've actually received numerous compliments from strangers on this handbag.  Looks like real leather!  Exactly as pictured.  Holds my wallet, makeup bag, big iphone, keys, and all the other &#34;stuff&#34; that mom's end up carrying around in their purse!  Would absolutely buy it again!"
4.0,"Its definitely well made. I dont think the clasp is titanium, probably stainless. At this price it should probably be titanium. But it still feels well made, i sometimes wear a small flashlight on it and i'm not real concerned with it breaking. The tritium tube pendant is made by RovyVon if anyones asking. Would be better if it had some kind of eztra tough titanium clasp though since geekslike me are likely to wear stuff on it."
4.0,These are a lot bigger than the picture makes you think.
4.0,Looks good on her !!
4.0,It is light and comfortable and my husband loved it for its beach look!  😍
4.0,"From Her Perspective: The design and color is true. If you want a playful print instead of a plain bikini, this is the bikini for you. On the back, you can adjust the straps to your liking so it’s friendly for smaller or longer torsos. The only problem with the bra is that the triangle cups are small. For me, that’s fine because I’m flat chested. In fact, the sides of my boobs show a bit, having an illusion that my boobs are actually not flat. Although, if someone has bigger boobs, maybe this would also look flattering to them because it would only cover the portion of their nipples, while the rest of their boobs show. Thats said, I think this bikini, specifically the bra, isn’t for diving, but just for walking by the beach side of dipping in the water but not extraneously swimming. The bottoms fits. I didn’t tie it to the tightest so the strap still show. I like that. It’s not a t-back so the butt cheeks doesn’t get accentuated much, if that’s your thing."
4.0,Silky material and great colors and fit!
4.0,"I like these a lot but the reason I gave 4 stars is because there is toe thong for the big toe and it’s tight in between the big toe not that comfortable, I wish they were just slip ons as they appear to be. Otherwise the soles are nice foam and they look cute on, also true to size."
4.0,"its a very cute dress, but i did feel the slightest bit self conscious wearing this since i have a smaller chest than what youd typically see wearing this. it was very cute though! i do recommend this dress to anyone, but if you also have less to present up top, you could maybe try to tweak it a bit to your comfort level (thats what i did!)"
4.0,"I put this on a Pebble smart watch and it fit perfectly. Once the leather broke in, it became much easier to put on every day. It looks great, I have received several compliments on my watch."
4.0,I like the way the hold my package.  You better order a size up.  They run small
4.0,The bag is much bigger than expected. It makes it hard to maneuver in daily life. The lock was a little scratched when I got it. I honestly wanted to return it but didn't want to pay the fee. It's ok now that I've lived with it for several months. It fits under airplane seats and leaves room for your feet. You can fit a lot in there. I love the middle pocket for easy key and phone access.
4.0,The shirt is very comfortable for going to gym and fits very nicely.
4.0,Love it except it is a bit too tight in the bust and I am not a large woman. But I love the design of the top for my water aerobics.
4.0,"It's cute, but if you have a broad shoulder or work to maintain the muscle in your arms you will not be able to wear it.  It's not designed for an athletic build."
4.0,The earrings were much smaller than they appeared online as an added item with the leaf necklace.
4.0,"Good compression socks, the size L/XL are a bit tight for people with larger calves, follow the instruction card for getting them on easily. Smashes the toes though, keep having to pull on the ends to relieve the toes."
4.0,"This jumpsuit is very pretty. The fabric doesn't provide any stretch. It's a bit long for me as I am petite, so I'll have to hem it up."
4.0,"I bought two orders of cold weather socks.  These ones worked better for the kids who wear size 2 shoes.  The socks were too big for my son who wears a size 12.  Overall, the socks were super comfortable and warm in the cold weather."
4.0,"i like this key case, however it took a really long time to get to me ... i would close to three weeks.  It case itself if made of good quality leather as others have said, however it was much larger than i expected .... this is not something that can just slip in your pocket and forget it is there.  It is more like a very small wallet.  You can keep your keep your key fob in it, but it is a bit of a hassle removing it from the case.  This case should last a long time since it seems to be made from quality materials, and the stitching seems strong.  However, you must really think of what you would put in here before you purchase this.  One thing for sure, you would never lose in in a purse.  I purchased this product  at a discount in exchange from my honest and unbiased review .... it it helped you at all i would appreciate you pressing the yest tab below"
4.0,Love Them.
4.0,Color are pastel
4.0,This is just the kit I've been wanting and looking. It is a little small for one of my watches but it works perfectly for all the others.
4.0,"Really cute, just runs a little small. Very well made."
4.0,"This dress is beautiful and fits me like a glove. It’s a bit longer than I like, but other than that it’s perfect."
4.0,Ok so if you still have the original gotcha wrist band you can tell very obviously that the material from these ones is very different. The wrist bands are not nearly as stiff and don’t feel as sturdy so I can understand if people lost their gotchas from using these other wrist bands. Other than that the gotcha seems to fit in it just fine. It wasn’t nearly as hard to put it this wrist band as the original wrist band which actually made me pretty happy. I just recommend keeping an eye on my gotcha because I have bent the wrist band a few times to see if it would stay in and it did but obviously I could feel it move in the wrist band so if I bent it more it would pop out.
4.0,Bought this for my son's birthday. He really likes it and wears it everyday! He just might be the only Jets fan in KS! Lol
4.0,"Haven't worn it hiking yet but just around the house and on errands to make sure they fit and starting to break them in. My left foot is a little larger than the right, and initially was tight around the toe area, but has loosened up some. The right one fits perfectly. They are fairly easy to get on and off, which is good."
4.0,Sleeves a little long.. But like body suit
4.0,"Great belt. TIP: When cutting for your size do not measure from the tip of belt - measure from where the teeth begin. I did the former and only get 2 clicks. Ultimately, I purchased another one for when I gain a few extra pounds."
4.0,Son loves Spiderman fits perfect and he has somewhat of a wide foot he is a camper so good buy. And I purchased the 9/10 size
4.0,"So I'm gonna be honest; I've never used pasties before, but I was going to a military function with my boyfriend and I was wearing a dress that was just not thick enough to hide my stupidly hard nipples (welcome to Alaska where the cold weather makes wearing dresses difficult). Anyways- these specific products were a lifesaver. They DID work, but they weren't quite what I expected which is why they're getting a 4 star rating instead of 5.<br /><br />I'm a C36 and my nipples are average sized- not too big, not small- just normal. With that being said these pasties were pretty big. They covered nearly a third of my boob. Maybe it's just because I haven't used pasties before- but I thought that they were just supposed to cover the nipple? For bigger breasted women this would be great. But for small-to-average boobed women like myself these are pretty big. With that being said they are thick enough to hide my hard nipples and smooth enough to look natural- not weird, under a dress. They fit very tightly to my skin and adequately covered everything up without making a weird bump in the center of my boob.<br /><br />The pasties stick right on over your nipple. They grip on good and once on, I barely felt them. They were SUPER comfortable to wear. I didn't notice them the entire night, but I also wasn't worrying about my nipples peeking through the dress the entire night- so I'd say that's a definite win, win right there. With that being said at the end of the night when I took the pasties off, I realized I had more nipple hair than I previously knew about- because they hurt a heck of a lot coming off. The pain of beauty- right?<br /><br />These are supposed to be reusable, but I wasn't sure how to store them to where they'd stay sticky. In the closet they'd collect dust. In the bathroom the humidity would wear them out. I tried to keep them, but the next time I tried to use them they didn't want to stick and stay. On top of that, if you tend to sweat a lot in the boob area- I'm not sure how long these would last either.<br /><br />BUT if you need some nipple covers for a single night that look flawless- these are your choice. They are SO comfortable to wear, stay in place, and look invisible (and make your nipples look invisible too!). Not sure if they're great for long-term use and they are a bit big (so larger women- these are a good choice!). But overall, they were a lifesaver for me and my thin dress!"
4.0,Love this shirt. Kind of funky after washing. But it’s cheap so I can’t complain too much. Looks nice dressed up or down.
4.0,"After reading the other reviews I went for a Medium. A few reviewers said that it ran really big in the chest. I'm a 34G (41""-29""-38"") and got the medium. It was WAY too tight in the bust and sadly had to be sent back. I'm thinking about getting the large but i fear that it'll be too big in the waist which is too bad."
4.0,"I love this purse. It is roomy, with the huge inner pocket separated by a thin cloth divider, which helps with organization. Inside, it has a med sized zipper pouch on one side, 2 little pen/ lipstick/ earbud pouches on the other, and a key hook to keep you from digging around to find them. There is a roomy zipper pocket on the exterior of the purse, which is where I keep my phone for easy access, and the details on the outside are beautiful.<br />The strap is long, adjustable by buckle, and can easily be worn cross body. It smells fantastic, and the leather is thick, zippers are chunky but close smoothly. This is my new go to bag, it's a cavernous carry all and matches anything I wear.<br /><br />I gave 4 stars due to shedding issues from the strap, which is caused by the way it has been tanned. Any time I take it off I have to check my shoulder for leather dust. Don't get me wrong, it is supple, not dry; I think it is from the edges, hoping that will take care of itself after more wear."
4.0,"Really nice, runs a little small."
4.0,"Very sweet trinket box, was purchased for a gift.  The only thing I would change is to add more crystals."
4.0,"Very cute, my daughter loves jewelry and elephants are her favorite animal, so it was a win win for her. I did dock one star because I thought these would be a pair, and they are not. You only get one earring, so therefore you have to order twice for a pair. That's the downside. Otherwise, they are very cute and sturdy, and there are different colors so that's awesome too. I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest, unbiased review."
4.0,After one winter's use I have no complaints. Good product for the price. The hat does not stretch as well as you would think and I have heard some tearing when I put it on too hastily. I have seen any damage to the hat though.
4.0,Worked great for a Minnesota Vikings NFL game!
4.0,It was purchased as a gift but my sister loves it!
4.0,Little stuff but works
4.0,I like the design and the quality
4.0,"I needed one sturdier to withstand my granddaughter opening and closing and opening and closing it a million times. So far, it is holding up. :-)"
4.0,"Glasses look really cool and fit the retro throwback style that is quicky coming back. The tinting is great and they are very comfortable to wear for someone with a wider face like mine. I love the carrying case they come with as well as the included repair tool and lens cleaning cloth. However, the lenses arrived dirty so I decided to clean them off before putting them on. This is when one of my lenses popped out. It was an easy fix but you need to very careful when cleaning. These are a great alternative to the pit viper style glasses that have become so popular. They feel more like ski goggles than anything and provide plenty of protection from the sun."
4.0,"If I'm forced to wear a ridiculous face diaper, I want people to know I object. We went from sheep, to lab rats (vaccine). Time to stand up for our liberties!"
4.0,Its v nice small cross body bag. Looks bigger in picture. Good for travel to keep wallet n passport.
4.0,Smaller than you might assume.
4.0,pendant is very nice but the chain was fairly cheap looking
4.0,wife liked it very much
4.0,These glasses are super cute! And they came in a sturdy glasses case with a microfiber cloth. Flimsier than I expected but I still love them.
4.0,I was expecting it like fingerless gloves but it's more like fingerless mittens where pointer finger through pinky share one hole. Still nice like socks for your armd
4.0,The lace detail is nice.  Fit is just a little more snug than a similar vintage pair I received yesterday.  They are a bit off white if you conpare them to a white wedding dress.  Depending on your hand size these might cover rings on your fingers.  Mine just barely show until I pull the glove snug.
4.0,Such a nice looking purse!! Took away one star because of the horrid smell. Smells like mixture of fish and pee. Just hoping that it'll go away
4.0,"Was a little expensive,  but the shirt is a thick cotton and seems well made. The picture is a good size,  maybe a little smaller than expected.  Overall very cool and fun to wear"
4.0,"Is okay. Is more of top than a dress, and I am only 5' 3&#34;"
4.0,it was a fun joke watch for kicks looks funny too
4.0,Good for the price. Looks like it does in the pictures. Front is slightly longer than the back
4.0,"These shirts are stretchy, I got the 4xl"
4.0,The case is a bit too tight for the sunglasses. And the tint is a bit on the dark side. OK for the price. Keychain screwdriver kit was interesting.
4.0,No tags on top or skirt to indicate weather your wearing it front or backwards
4.0,They're just as described..  The chain does not turn colors when used as with some earrings.  My wife gets lots of compliments and it's a way she shares in my love of cycling!
4.0,I didn't expect the silky material. It's alright. Fit is good! I'm happy
4.0,I normally wear large but a medium may have been fine. Nice dress. Comfortable yet classy
4.0,Great for plus size girls with big bellies ❤️
4.0,I loved it.. this is what I expected
4.0,"Great fro the price, we purchased 10 of them for gifts for my son's class at school....<br />They shipped faster than expected and for the price certainly worth it."
4.0,This was a lot longer than expected but the quality is good.
4.0,"A little smaller that expected, but my granddaughter loves it!"
4.0,Really cute but it makes ur fingers green
4.0,the quality is great
4.0,"I love this bag. It’s got lots of pockets to put stuff in. It looks amazing, and the zippers are very nice. Great size. I’m giving it 4 stars because there’s not much structure to it. You would have to completely pack it full of stuff for it to stay in shape. Kind of annoying, but I still love it."
4.0,Love this high low but zipper was not sewn in its full length so the dress will not go over the shoulders 😟😟😟
4.0,"Really like this pullover, its great quality fabric, and it cozy feeling when on.  It is just what I wanted, fits and looks just like it does in the picture"
4.0,I wanted to give 5 stars because they really are BEAUTIFUL! However they are super cheaply made. And the one earring wasn’t even centered. It’s still a great deal.
4.0,"The colors on the turkey pendant are quite stunning! Impressive and bright, my wife is looking forward to wearing this for thanksgiving from now on.<br />We would recommend using a stronger chain as the one that comes with it feels like it could break easily, but the turkey pendant is high quality and brings a smile to your face!"
4.0,Nice pair of sunglasses for the price
4.0,"Good product, but not as pictured.  Was super fast delivery & I am overall mostly satisfied.  Would like for the photo to reflect more accurately however."
4.0,Different material but cute and fashionable.<br />I like how light weight it is for a hot day.
4.0,very good quality .<br />Has alot of strecth.
4.0,"Nice quality.  Bought a 3X, fits like a 2X."
4.0,I really like this band<br />Worked great with my fitbit blaze
4.0,I really liked this key chain but the only problem was it wouldn't go on my ring with my keys it wouldn't stay shut
4.0,Beautiful but a tad bigger than expected.  but still amazing.
4.0,"They are really cool, but  really big!!"
4.0,The bikini looks as pictured and fit as expected. The only reason I am giving 4 stars is because of personal taste. I am a bit chubby so it didn't look right on my body type. My rolls were accentuated not flattered at all.
4.0,"This is a rather comfortable collar, although be sure to measure the length of your neck because 2 inches is thicker than one would think. The leash that comes with it is fairly durable, but very short. Great for play and posture training."
4.0,"Size 6 is a size 6. It is a timeless and cute design. But be aware of the V neck and the high waist killer combination. Did not work for me, hence the four star rating. If you are slim build like me, make sure you get a size 2 - for it to fit. Timely refund from the seller."
4.0,It was some what smaller than I thought but I love the shirt. Love the color and the material of it. So I don't mind using it open. :)
4.0,Love this tank! My new favorite. Wish I would have gotten a medium though. The large is a bit too large.
4.0,"These diffuser cages are pretty and the quality seems good.  They come with numerous small Pom poms of various colors, 4 small beads and 2 freshwater pearls to be used with the cages.  It only includes one chain which is very thin and unlikely to hold up to everyday use.  You should expect to use a more substantial chain."
4.0,"Sound is great. Phone calls descent. Warm and fits great. Thd only thing I don't like is that its difficult to tell if you've got it turned off or on and that hole for the pony tail needs some reinforcement, once that flimsy little band breaks this hat is going to unravel."
4.0,"It's an old lady  gown. It was a gift for an overlay. She's in a nursing home and barely able to communicate with anybody. So honestly, I have no idea how it fits how it looks how comfortable it is."
4.0,"5'4&#34; 116lb and ordered small. top fits perfect, bottom is loose and flowy... very comfortable all around; just like wearing your favorite shirt. photos were taken straight out of the amazon bag, so very wrinkled.  love the dark green color. i am returning the beige color because it is nothing like the color in the stock photo. it is more like a french vanilla ice cream color, and it is see through. the darker colors are not see through."
4.0,"I got the mint in a medium. It fit bigger than expected. I washed it in cold water on normal cycle with like colors and hung out to dry and it remained perfect. No wrinkles, shrinking or stretching. I normally wear a small or med tops. Stick with you normal size in this shirt. Even the girls who are busty. I'm 5'6&#34; &  155 pounds. Otherwise if this didn't run so big I would've given it 5 stars."
4.0,"A little larger than expected since it was a gift for a baby.  Good thing, he can wear it in the future if he desires."
4.0,Adorable but a little heavy.
4.0,I like them. I’ll need to size down but that’s mainly because I’m short. They’re light and soft.
4.0,"It's a really nice ring, great price and shiny. Only problem is the picture makes the band look wider than it actually is proportionately. The ring is going to arrive looking thinner than the picture. I ordered the wider 6 mm and it doesn't look like the picture."
4.0,Beautiful costume or everyday jewelry. I wear it occasionally and get compliments. The butterfly is nice
4.0,"Overall, for less than $20 it was a good buy. I feel like if I wore too much or washed with other clothing it would have a lot of piling. The material isn’t the best quality, but I like the fit. I should have ordered a size up bc it’s a little snug but I can still wear."
4.0,"Purchased small, fits very loose. Not sure if I will purchase a smaller size."
4.0,"This is a very comfortable casual dress, but I have even dressed it up with a blazer or nice sweater. It does run a little large though, so if you are between sizes I would size down."
4.0,Pretty awesome gadget. I thought it’d become handy this winter of 2020 as one spends more time outdoors.<br />It is a little odd working but I guess it makes some sense:<br />- you switch it on and in time it’ll turn off automatically. I guess that’s fine cause if u don’t get cold it means it’s retaining heat but in order to turn it back on I usually need to unplug it from the power and plug it back.<br />- oh it comes with multiple snap buttons so you can adjust to size but if ur slim it will bunch up fabric a bit. Not the most comfortable nor stylish item but if worn over sweater and under coat ur hood to go.<br /><br />Keeping it tho!
4.0,"I love it, it's just a tad snug, thankfully I ordered up a size"
4.0,These jeans are distressed. Although I am not a fan of pre-weathering it does look authentic. The fabric is soft and they are true to size. They are short; not capris but above ankle for sure. They are comfortable on and look pretty goid.
4.0,"This is a pretty cute bracelets and would be popular with anyone who's gone through some adversity in their life. I actually purchased it to give as a gift to a friend who has had a very tough year this year. Through it all, she's been super brave and courageous and has never even once mentioned giving up or the fight to being too difficult.<br /><br /> This bracelet is very on trend. It is a thin leather that wraps around the rest several times. I like that you can customize the size to fit almost any rest since you wrap it around as many times as you would like.<br /><br /> There is a little charm also on the leather that is an anchor. This lens homage to the theme of refusing to sync and staying afloat no matter what life throws your way.<br /><br /> There is also a plaque on it that is metal and says, &#34;I refuse to sink&#34;.  This is pretty cute and it is done in a way that is a little more casual of lettering style so that it lends itself to every day wear more than fine jewelry.<br /><br /> It comes in a really nice Valore type gift box that you would expect from a jewelry store or you would expect to contain some fine jewelry. Honestly, that was the one thing I thought was a little strange because if you gave this to someone, they might be expecting some fine jewelry inside only to open it up and see that there is a plain leather wrap bracelet.<br /><br /> I actually took off one star because I don't think this is the best and finest quality. It looks about what the value is so that's good but I wasn't overly impressed or blown away by the quality of the item.<br /><br /> I was able to purchase this item at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. I hope you found my review helpful and that they provided enough information and guidance so that you can determine whether or not this item is right for you and what you were looking for. I think it would be a great gift for any high school senior who is graduating or college student who is graduating, or really anyone who's gone through some type of adversity."
4.0,It fits as in the size guide.
4.0,I have small hands and the gloves I got were size large. I feel like they may run a bit small for someone with large hands unless you want them very snug. Stitching is good and the material is very  very soft. The wrist has 2 snaps to tighten and adjust a little which is nice. Good quality for the money :)
4.0,Cute shirt for work! Can be dressed up or worn casual. Definitely need to tuck The front if you have a large chest or else you’ll look wide (typical for any flowy top on us chesty girls)
4.0,"I really like this, I just think it runs large. I ordered a small and I had to adjust the straps all the way to the shortest length and I still wish the straps were shorter. I am 5'5"" 120 pounds."
4.0,I love this dress it just runs small in the breast area.
4.0,"This top is SO cute. It arrived exactly as described and fit like a dream. I wear a D-cup and have a little tummy, so I ordered an XL. The fit is a little drapey, but not too baggy, which is just what I was looking for!<br /><br />The only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is because I haven't washed it yet, so I don't know how well it holds up but for the price, you can't beat this versatile top. IF it holds up well in the wash, I'll probably order another one in a different color"
4.0,"I purchased as a gift for my boyfriend last year as a gift, at that time I purchased two belts.<br />This Christmas was two belts, different pattern as well a different buckle selection. I also liked my boyfriend can  to trim down( I went up on size up, I would suggest if you have a dad bod man! Dislike, if your right handed you are not able to reverse buckles with specific pattern, example: animals, people, ect. If you want to ratchet on the right you cannot."
4.0,I’m LOVING these glasses for the price. They’re a bit heavy and stiff. I’m hoping they’ll break-in a bit after some use. But overall I’m very happy with them.
4.0,"Fun piece.  Nice with my boho tops and dresses.  This is costume jewelry, but it's nicely made and good colors.  I like it!"
4.0,I had ordered the light blue ones and the color was slightly different than i had expected
4.0,Did  not care for the look
4.0,"I was looking for a bikini with a little extra coverage in the chest for family vacation and this suit did the job! It is comfy and well made, plus offers a little bit of extra support with the removable pads! When I look good, I feel good, and this suit has me LOOKIN and FEELIN great!"
4.0,Should have ordered a larger size. This was a gift.
4.0,"Great quality, just a bit tighter than I wanted.  Will have to stretch it a bit."
4.0,"It helped for a good week, after the week my legs felt ok but not as good as the first week I wore them."
4.0,"This is a very strangely sized sweater. The sleeves are easily 6&#34; too long; they flap over my fingertips like a child wearing his dad's shirt. The sweater itself, however, runs really small around the chest and abdomen. I bought a larger size and will just roll the sleeves up. They are WAY too long to even just slide them up or bunch them up at the elbow. That said, the quality is better than I was expecting for a holiday sweater. I looked for a Festivus sweater last year in November and everything was sold out. Bought this one early this year. Can't wait to wear it!"
4.0,Was somewhat tight but love the boots!!!!
4.0,These little plastic backs work great.  No more loosing &#34;hook&#34; earrings!  Wish I had ordered these sooner before I had lost some of my favorite earrings!
4.0,"The dress is beautiful and wonderful quality, but it runs small. Not true to size."
4.0,"My daughter wanted me to grab this dress for her. She's recently gone from concert t-shirts and jeans, to wanting to dress up a little more. The dress is very cute, and great for summer. Lightweight, and the color really pops too."
4.0,Great quality in material. Definitely smaller than expected. But I luckily ordered a larger size. Company has since then contacted me and sent me another size free of charge!! Would highly recommend them to friends and family.
4.0,It was one of my back up costumes and I'm happy the quality is good.<br />The size works out well and the glasses quality is not bad.<br />Basically you will get what you have paid for.
4.0,Colors are amazing! Fit is true to size. 4yo daughter absolutely loves this hoodie.
4.0,"For $8, this is a pretty decent necklace. The colors are pretty and as shown. Mine had a small chip on the bottom but overall, I am pleased with this necklace."
4.0,"The dress that came was not what we expected to get, but it is rather cute. It fits the age bracket of 4-6 year old. It's soft where it touches the skin. The colors are bright and it's comfortable and easy to run in, does not confine movements. It bunches some in the back but it's hardly noticeable especially when my girl is on the move. All in all, nice dress for a party or just any day."
4.0,I am really impressed on how fast I received this necklace from the seller! Super cute necklace.
4.0,"Fits as expected, breathable fabric, took a little time to receive, work APPROPRIATE an doesn't lose much tightness with use."
4.0,"Waist feels odd, tall, but the  corduroy is thick and comfy. I bought another pair bc it’s difficult to find corduroys these days. 33 waist was the best fit for me."
4.0,Beautiful but a little too big
4.0,The rings themself are awesome. A little hard to put in at first just because I've never worn this type before but easy once you get used to them. I do recommend that you play with them a little first just cause I had a hard time putting it on and taking it out at first. The only reason for the 4 star review is because I wish you could choose which colors you get. I had to give the gold one to a friend since I would never wear it.
4.0,"These feel good, they fit good and wear very well. I'm curvy so I was concerned at first. They looked small but I ordered per the size chart and they fit great. Had to share the purchase link cause my friends loved them too. Only con is that they loosen up a bit after some hours."
4.0,"Very attractive sandals.  I love that you can adjust each strap to custom fit your foot.  The arch support hits in the correct place for me, and I’ve done some extensive walking in these.  My only negative is that my feet tend to sweat in them, and that’s not something I’ve ever noticed with any other shoe."
4.0,I got these for my husband since his old flip flops have seen (much) better days. These are really nice looking flip flops. They would look fantastic with a pair of jeans at a pool party. Unfortunately my husband doesn’t like the arch support. It is a bit high and hard for his feet.
4.0,"Cute, but tore the inseam while putting it on. On my child, not myself"
4.0,Nice boots. They are holding up well. They are sized small though. I had to go up 2 sizes for a good fit but still a little narrow until broken in.
4.0,"Nice, as indicated"
4.0,Silky material. 4 stars was not expecting silly and slight thinness
4.0,"Comfortable, fits well. Fair pricing. Decent bottom with reasonable grip. I would have liked a bit more cushion, that would have earned a 5th star. I would purchase again, and probably will."
4.0,"You know, it’s kind of cute actually.  The fabric is thinner than I expected, but look at the price, I should have expected that."
4.0,"I love this pair of beautiful earrings.  They sparkle nicely and are very classy. They've proven great for work, church & an evening out.  I wish I could rate it a half star down due to heaviness, but they are still a favorite for me. There's another issue: I have very sensitive ears.  For some reason, I'm unable to wear them a full day before experiencing discomfort.  Needless to say, a little neosporin goes a long way.  After dabbing a bit on the posts, I am able to wear them longer."
4.0,My boyfriend loved these on me.
4.0,Is the second time that i buy. I like
4.0,My absolute only complaint is not taking the time to line up the print especially when the plaid is so big
4.0,"These shorts are very cute, but I recommend getting a size up. They're a bit tighter than I thought as well, fitting more like spandex."
4.0,"I've been wanting to get something along these lines for almost a year now.  I have a 14 month old and an almost 4 year old and no matter what, just do not have time to spend hours in the gym anymore to get back to where I used to be.  I really like that this one has shoulder straps to help hold it in place, the last thing I wanted to be doing was adjusting and pulling it back up!<br /><br />The quality of this is fantastic! The zipper is great and then behind the zipper I was surprised to see there are hooks and then even a special different style hook at the top, sort of like a tiny bathing suit closure to keep everything really secure and from putting too much strain on the zipper.  Over all incredibly well made at this price point!!<br /><br />I will say I was really surprised as well to see the way the bottom and underwear zone are... I wasn't expecting there to be an opening, conveint I guess, but I just don't care for that.  I fell it takes the item from being something that I want to help me feel more confident to something that is more of an intimate item that isn't my style.<br /><br />I am roughly a size 8/10 and ordered the large.  This size is snug going over my thighs-but is the perfect snug fit for my waist.  I have a only very slightly more curvy booty and have found the bottom of this to be uncomfortable, this part is a little tight and rides up into my bottom really quickly-nothing about these fit like the boy shorts shown on the model.  That is the most disappointing element for me. That said, I will still plan to wear this when needed-just probably wont be as often as I had planned.<br /><br />I received a code that allowed me to purchase this product for free or at a discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.  These are honestly my thoughts and feelings and hope you find this review helpful.  If you do, please click YES below.<br />Thank you! : )"
4.0,Keeps my face covered and warm.
4.0,"Very cute purse and arrived earlier than expected!  Would have given 5 stars, but color is off from what pic shows. It's actually faded greenish/turquoise color with vintage, distressed looking studs. Not a bright blue/turquoise as pic shows."
4.0,"I love it, the color was great, it seems sturdy. I've had it for a while and the saying is starting to fade so I want to order another one because the saying is so adorably ridiculous. My coworkers got a huge kick out of it. It fit tons of cards, so I love the wallet. It took a while to ship but with how cheap it is, it was worth waiting."
4.0,"I don't go to the beach often, but when I do , I like to cover up when I can. Such a fantastic color and pretty floral design. When walking it flows beautifully with the breeze. Feels nice against skin, not too rough. Well spent =)"
4.0,Nice and nice price
4.0,"My 14 year old daughter loves these gloves.  She wears them every day to school.<br />The look reminds me of Billy Idol in the 80's when he wore studded gloves in a music video.<br /><br />While the gloves look cheap to me, I should expect greatness for a low price.  The main thing that matters is the value for the price, and certainly that my daughter is very happy with these."
4.0,"Super comfy, just wish it had a yoga waistband for even more comfort."
4.0,"Love this shirt, I get so many compliments on it. I bought a size up after reading other reviews, but should have bought my regular size. I usually wear a medium, sometimes a small. The large was too loose for me, so I took in the sides myself so it would fit better. The material is a little on the stiff side, and not the most flattering fit, but looks good enough. I was a little disappointed with the color...I bought the purple, and its more a cranberry. Good enough quality for the price."
4.0,"I'm 5'8 and @ 130 lbs, and the Small fit well. The length is long enough and perfect to wear with a 3 inch heel, and very elegant with a blouse. I haven't yet washed them, so I hope they don't shrink too much. Would not put these in a dryer."
4.0,My wife says it's cuter than expected.
4.0,"Great watch, fits and feels good"
4.0,Cute bracelet. I bought it for a gift.
4.0,These are nice because they don’t get snagged on when taking clothes on or off for little ones. My only issue is that they have started to kind of tarnish so they aren’t the same color but they will do the job until I find her earring we love.
4.0,Seems to be good quality. But was smaller than expected.
4.0,Love this dress. I get lots of compliments.
4.0,"When I removed the scarf from the package, I was horrified to find the scarf COVERED in human hair, it was so bad I didn’t even want to put it on. I know this is such a minor complaint, but seriously, yuck! Thankfully this bad boy is machine washable, so I popped it in for peace of mind, and I can not wait to use it everyday!"
4.0,"Bought this as a gift for my partner. Works great, great for minimalists. The keys can be a little loosey goosey but that could be because I put a car key in there which isnt a regular key- but still not bad. It definitely can hold a lot of regular keys. Only annoying thing is you can’t put the airtag in on the other side (i had an air tag customized and cannot display that) Otherwise, its a cool little thing. My partner doesn't like bulky or loud keychains so this is perfect for her."
4.0,Very nice quality for the price. Could use a few more pockets/dividers. Also strap could be more comfortable. Perfect size for a carry on bag. And I like that it has one exterior pocket.
4.0,A little bigger designs than expected.
4.0,It was perfect for our dress up day at school.
4.0,"They are small.  Would not fit an adult, but work great for our Girl Scout event.  Nice variety of colors."
4.0,Nice and comfortable for night wear.
4.0,Has plenty of room and my phone fits in it. The only thing is the zipper seems hard to zip but like it so far!! Worth the price!!
4.0,"The sweatshirt material is not very thick, but it looks exactly like the picture."
4.0,"These are great, my only complaint is they fog up pretty bad after a while of use."
4.0,It was absolutely cute but I had to return it. It was too small in the shoulders and upper arms. Also I didn't care for the hook style fasteners it had. The long tail did flow nicely though. If I could get the replacement shipped to the Amazon locker nearby I more than likely would've tried a bigger size.
4.0,"Arrived as expected, card verse is encouraging, necklace and pendant are ok.  Pendant is very small, necklace is not impressive."
4.0,My only complaint is the seam ripped out the second time it was washed. The washer is a bit hard on clothes but this seemed too soon. Nice overall.
4.0,daughter liked them.  although she said that they look like mini hippos she still loves them
4.0,"It looks nice and it was a good deal, but it’s a little noisy, and the sometimes the date will stick."
4.0,"Very cute, as pictured.  Some pieces have very small holes where you add a cord, too small for my cords."
4.0,I love that this suit is not too high-cut in the thighs. It provides good support for my breasts as well.
4.0,Product was good. Not sure of the material but great. Does run a bit small just an FYI.<br />Height: 5’5”<br />Weight: 170<br />Size I got was XL I’m usually a med/large
4.0,Very sturdy and we'll made
4.0,It is an attractive watch and the picture looks better. There's no direction on how to put this toggether. confuse.
4.0,Pretty good lenses there not good on a motorcycle tho but overall not bad would buy again
4.0,"This delicate star necklace is a little smaller than I expected but is so pretty. The chain is adjustable and hangs right below my neck. The stars are tiny and twinkle in the light. I really like this necklace!<br />Happiness Boutique sent me codes, so I got this for free but all opinions are my own."
4.0,Product is okay for the cost. Golden hands are not that pretty.
4.0,"Love the ferl of the bottom, soft on feet."
4.0,"Nice shirt, but a good bit larger than usual larges that I buy. Very baggy. I am always a large, but I feel a medium would have fit a lot better in this shirt."
4.0,"Casio describes this watch, the AMWS320-7AV, as follows:<br /><br />""Based on the best-selling AMW320 case design, the AMW-S320, with its classic dive-style design is more powerful than before thanks to Self-Charging, Tough Solar Power.""<br /><br />Casio has sold AMW320 Marine Gear watches for over twenty years. Arnold Schwarzenegger wore one in Kindergarten Cop (1990) and they are popular today.  Is the updated AMWS320-7AV worth our attention?  For comparison, look at [[ASIN:B00134QLDC Casio Men's AMW320R-7EV Sport Alarm Ana-Digi Dive Watch]].<br /><br />Both watches have solid stainless steel cases without plastic bumpers or bezels.  AMW320 measures 46 x 11mm.  AMWS320 is 46.1 x 14.2mm, a tighter fit under a dress shirt -- but you probably wouldn't wear either watch with a suit and tie.<br /><br />Both watches have 22mm lugs and a plastic strap, [[ASIN:B000P6CXNQ Casio 22mm Black Resin-Marine Gear]].  Many Casio watches have straps which are difficult to remove and can only be replaced with an identical Casio strap.  The AMW320 and AMWS320 have standard lugs in a popular size, and there are hundreds of replacement straps and bracelets you can chose from.  To many of us, 22mm lugs and a solid stainless steel case are the most attractive things about these watches.  Are you listening, Casio?<br /><br />Both watches have rotating timer bezels which are traditional with divers' watches. The bezels are cheap steel stampings with enameled steel inserts. They are bi-directional, easy to turn, and easy to turn accidentally. They look a little cheap, but steel looks better than plastic. Why are timer bezels on these ana-digi watches? Because their LED stopwatch mode is button-controlled, and button pushing is a no-no in the water.<br /><br />Casio rates both watches at 100 meters water resistance. You can wear them in the water but they are not intended for scuba diving, which is why Casio says they have ""dive-style design"" but does not call them divers' watches.  More on this later.<br /><br />AMWS320-7AV has a rechargeable battery and a photovoltaic cell to recharge it. I assume the thicker case was needed to make room for this. Rechargeable batteries wear out and are expensive to replace. Amazaon sells [[ASIN:B0080GQDCU Casio - ML2016 Solar Rechargeable Battery Replacement Cells]] for this watch.  For half the price of this battery, a watch repair shop will replace a non-rechargeable battery, install it, replace the O-ring gasket if necessary, and lubricate the gasket and case back threads with silicone grease. ""Solar power"" is not a money-saver but it can be a time saver. If it saves you enough trips to your watchmaker or jeweler, you may find it worthwhile.<br /><br />AMWS320-7AV has an optional Power Saving function which blanks the display but maintains digital timekeeping when the watch is left in the dark for an extended period. Rechargeable watch batteries last longer if they are never completely drained.<br /><br />AMWS320-7AV has a larger, ""smile"" shaped LED with a more readable font and a backlight. This is an upgrade for anyone who uses the alarm, stopwatch, and calendar functions -- although an all-digital watch would be a bigger upgrade. An ana-digi dial is a compromise: this one improves the digital display at the expense of the analog display. The markers and hands are smaller than the AMW320's, so the lume is weaker and does not last as long; and there is no second hand. I can live without the second hand, but 3 hour lume is a step backward from 6 hour lume if you use your watch in the dark.<br /><br />When you finish setting the time on AMWS320-7AV's digital display, the analog display automatically adjusts to match it. To me this is a gee whiz feature but it's fun. It is not fool proof, and there is a button-pushing function to manually correct the analog display. Yes, this watch has no stem! I guess that is the future.<br /><br />AMWS320-7AV has an extra LED function which Casio calls ""dual-time display."" It can display a secondary digital time which does not correct the analog display: for example, the time in another time zone. This is not a useful function for me, but it may be for you.<br /><br />The AMWS320-7AV's case back is a stamped steel plate held by four tiny Phillips-head screws. That is typical of Casio's newer watches, but it is a big step backward from AMW320's machined screw-down case back. You need a case wrench to remove a screw-down case back, but the machined part will last forever. Tiny Phillips screws are easy to spoil and easier to lose.<br /><br />I have knocked off one star for the stamped case back and weaker lume. If you need the LED functions, AMWS320-7AV is the better watch. Saving the best for last, right now it is also the cheaper watch. That probably means it is out of production, but it's a bargain while it lasts.<br /><br />If all you need is an analog timekeeper, the AMW320's superior analog display is worth a few dollars more.<br /><br />Going back to water resistance, Casio rates this watch for 100 meters water resistance. Please understand that 100 meters does not mean 100 meters underwater. Casio designed its water seals to withstand 10 atmospheres or ""10 bar"" pressure. The watch industry is convinced that its customers cannot understand atmospheres or bars, except for the kind with swinging doors. I am not a cultural historian, and I do not know when or how 10 atmospheres turned into 100 meters: but believe me, if you wore this watch on a 300 foot dive, you would not return with a working watch. This is what the industry's water resistance numbers mean:<br /><br />30 meters/3 atmospheres/3 bar = splash resistant: good for a spilled drink and hand washing, but it might not survive dishwashing.<br /><br />50 meters/5 atmospheres/5 bar = sprinkle resistant: wear it in the shower or in a driving rain.<br /><br />100 meters/10 atmospheres/10 bar = immersion resistant: wear it swimming but not off a high board.<br /><br />200 meters/20 atmospheres/20 bar = diving resistant: sport diving to the usual depth of 30 or 40 feet, and perhaps to 100 feet or a little deeper to examine a wreck."
4.0,My wife really loved irt! Made for a good anniversary!
4.0,"I bought this as a gift for my son. The winding pin fell out almost instantly, but he found it quickly, and it's been a workhorse since. More importantly, he loves it."
4.0,Like it but it's too large

4.0,I like this cap.  I worked half of my life for the state of Texas.  A nice reminder. Thank You.
4.0,"Me gusta. La tela es fresca y cómoda, strech..."
4.0,"Very Nice Wallet! For those that are wondering if a checkbook could be put behind the card slots-YES. Both areas where the card slots are located can have a checkbook inserted behind it, with the checks overlaying the cards. You do not have to put your checkbook in the money/phone area."
4.0,"The ones that came, we’re not the ones in the picture.  A little disappointed."
4.0,"I purchased these for Christmas last year for my daughter as a one size fits all, she is now 9 months old & they still don't even come close to fitting. I'm hoping in the next few months they will fit or I will be selling them"
4.0,"This dress looks well constructed and is as pictured. The fabric on the top is soft and you can't see through the white stripes. The sleeves were a little big on me but the length was good. The skirt was longer than I expected, so I should have measured the length on myself before purchase. Ultimately I will be returning this because I felt like the fit didn't quite suit me but I would still recommend this dress to others! My measurements are as follows: Bust (at fullest with bra) 36&#34;, Waist 28&#34;, Hips 39.5&#34;, Height 5'2&#34;, Weight 125."
4.0,"Bought this hat for the beach, it is slightly big but kept the sun off and the wind didn't blow it off. I would buy it again."
4.0,"It can fit my daughter, but the skirt is too short.  The sequins might be a little itchy, and the rose sometimes falls off.  Overall, I would recommend this product, its beautiful and pretty."
4.0,Took 2 hours to make it! Disappointed it was not all ready tied for the price charged!
4.0,It is a pretty case just didn't fit my phone
4.0,"A very nice quality.  although one of the braided straps let out a little (didn't disconnect, but just loosened some), the snap still stays in great shape.  The design is really unique and it was bought as a friendship bracelet.  Not easy to write on for that purpose, but the aesthetic still makes it very pleasing to still have."
4.0,Liked everything except that it runs small.
4.0,Beautiful ring at an affordable price. Just wish they were more variety in sizes 3 & 4.
4.0,"The pjs looked great! The fit is pretty good, not perfect that’s why I gave four stars. The top is over sized , bottoms are roomie enough.  The fabric is mixed poly, better than 💯 percent poly. I recommend these pjs for the price."
4.0,Nice quality and stretchy!
4.0,"Smaller lenses than expected, but still very wearable, almost like an antique pair of reading glasses .....unique....no doubt."
4.0,"This dress is really nice. I love the cut and style. The top is just not meant for bustier women, but it has so much potential. I just ordered the new version to see if it’s better because I like it so much."
4.0,Cute! True to size
4.0,"Very comfortable and great to wear around the house. I bought them thinking they would be tighter, but they are loose. This is fine for my use, but just be aware."
4.0,Pretty nice Chelsea boot. Great fit and comfortable. They look great but are not suede.
4.0,Fun light spacious<br />Purse for summer
4.0,Was very soft and comfortable
4.0,This product was ordered for school use in class by a 4yold I really expected them to be packaged with inside sets of 10s or 1/2 by 25 each set… Please read descriptions before ordering next set
4.0,"Pretty color. I usually wear an xl in clothes so that was the size that I ordered, but it was a little too big."
4.0,I love this coat! Great for winters in south. I wouldn’t recommend if you’re looking for a really warm coat
4.0,An but tight but great lightweight socks
4.0,Very comfortable to wear. Material was very good quality
4.0,"This is nice, but thin material."
4.0,"Very oversized, heavy feeling. wish they were polarized."
4.0,"This dress is very short, but ok if you wear it with tights"
4.0,Good knife for the money the sheath is okay all at all happy with the purchase
4.0,"Bought it to be used as a mask and works like it should. The only reason I am taking off a star is because within a couple of weeks of very light use (and no washing) , I see threads coming loose. I think this is more like a 6 month use it and throw it type of product"
4.0,My Son liked them alot
4.0,"The dress is classy and cute, it is a bit longer so make sure u have long legs or you will prob need to fix the dress a bit.<br /><br />Overall this is a comfy fabric that feel like it will stretch over time so I will be very careful with it, however i loved it."
4.0,You don’t need to worry about the holes in the belt getting stretched out or growing out of the belt since there are no holes it’s a ratchet style and they give you plenty of belt length. The ratchet wears out within months so it will pop open randomly with bending over or with general movement
4.0,Very cute and wasn't tangled!  Nice to wear any time of year (or weather) under an open-neck blouse or over a tee.  I was surprised at the quality for such a small price!
4.0,[[VIDEOID:4958cbd6bbe70a5575f8c839f6f5d4d7]] I never take it off!
4.0,"I love deep/dark red clothes and the style of this top is extremely cute. A great way to dress up a pair of jeans or give your wardrobe a touch of originality.<br /><br />The fabric is nice. Thin without it being see through (apart from the parts that are MEANT to be see through, of course)<br /><br />I only have two negative cons about this top:<br /><br />- I ordered looking at the chart, yet it was a bit big on me. Also, the chest area which is cut to adapt to your breasts, seems to be a little too low for me. I don't have super fake perky breasts or anything and I'm 5'7"" so not short. Yet it seemed like the way it was cut it was meant to be for someone with a longer torso. Nothing too bad. But I will need to fix it a little.<br />- As seen in my picture, you can see the size tag from the back through the fabric. Not a major con, but I honestly don't want every single person walking behind me to see what size I wear. It just seems weird. Since it's sewed into the thin see-through fabric I would be too scared to cut it off and risking making a hole in the delicate fabric.<br /><br />Overall, I do love the top. After that tiny fixing in the chest area I plan to wear it A LOT."
4.0,"The straps were a little long for me, but otherwise a flattering top."
4.0,"Runs small, the elastic around the bodice is tight. It's also too long. Love the pockets, and print. I've recieved several compliments."
4.0,"Very pretty colors, fits well. Requires ironing when washed and dried due to heavy wrinkling."
4.0,This is a lovely shirt- nice and long and not too see-through.<br />It will need to be ironed and I may also air dry to keep it from shrinking.
4.0,These were for my husband and he said they were fine.  He liked them; they're comfortable and work.
4.0,"I love this dress, however I thought it was going to be a bit more wrap dress than the two little buttons and tie. Still cute though."
4.0,Very pleased with the shirts
4.0,I find that sizes are hard to figure out. The Asian sizing is somewhat dicey. I could have used a smaller size however I am alright with the larger size.  I like that the material is light weight  I got an xxl  and I am 5' 1 and 34D.
4.0,"Good sweater, fits well . Perrrrrrfect for Christmas parties."
4.0,"Not exactly as it looks in the picture, but still super cute. The colors are brighter than in the picture, more white. And the slit/zipper aren't in the back like people are saying. It looks like it because it's close to the tags, but the tags are long width wise so it's actually fine. I'm 5'6 and it touches the floor so I have to wear it with tall shoes. Sizing is small. I have a 34-36 inch waist and got a large, should have gotten an XL, but it still fits, just a tad tight. Slit is a little high up, about 3/4ths the way up my thigh. Overall I think it's a great skirt. Especially for being so cheap."
4.0,"This is a good money clip for the money, Would have preferred a smoother finish and black stitching, but as time goes on the finish is smoothing and it does the job of being a good money clip."
4.0,"A little smaller than I thought it would be and handle does not extend very far, but maybe that's because the canopy is smaller than I thought.  All that said, it is still exactly as advertised, unless it says windproof.  I can tell it's not, so I'm careful with it."
4.0,"This frog shirt is adorable. It fits as expected but the green is definitely not as advertised. It's basically doublemint gum colored. The printing on the shirt is one of those thick vinyl feeling prints that is hot under it, bound to eventually crack and wear away but while new, looks great.<br />Overall, it's a nice shirt that fits correctly to the size and if you like this color green, then there aren't really any downsides while the graphics on it last."
4.0,"Soft material, beautiful shades and the slightly smaller fit isn't that bad.  Comfortable and relaxing to wear."
4.0,Love this wallet. It's perfect size and colorful. When I take it out everyone says they like it and ask where I got it. I've had trouble with wallets being anak and eventually fall apart. This one is great no problems.
4.0,"I really like the shape of these pants they are super comfy and flattering . A little se thru but manageable, also a little long .  Would buy again"
4.0,"They are a little bigger than I wanted for casual wear, but they really are beautiful for the money. Will enjoy wearing them for dressier occasions."
4.0,They are very hard to screw on and off
4.0,"I purchased these little finger lights for my children to bring to school for valentine's day for their classmates, (no candy allowed), and these lights were a huge hit.  They work great with a nice strong light, but not a direct beam, and are tons of fun in the dark with color lights swaying all over the room as you move.  There were a few that did not work, but I ordered extras based on some of the other reviewers stating there were some that did not work.  They arrived fast.  Some of the lights were not in the individual packaging, they could have slipped out somewhere in transit.  A few packages had been taped shut, but the lights in those few packages worked fine.  For the price, they are an excellent buy as a giveaway for children, tons of fun.  The colors in the lights are nice bold colors, and they fit around a finger of varying sizes very comfortably.  I highly recommend.  As we gave the vast majority of these lights away, and have only been using for 3 days, I cannot comment on how long the lights will last. Inexpensive money, bright colorful lights, minor glitches with the packaging, which will be thrown away, (recycled) anyway.  Happy children."
4.0,"The reviews said to size-up, however, I wish I hadn’t.  I’d rather need to use the side-zip.  It’s a bit big. I’m 5’8” and 150lbs, 36C. I bought a large in purple -- wish I had purchased a medium. I used it essentially as a coverup on vacation.  BTW, the skirting didn’t hang like pictured. It sort of waved and flowed, but didn’t have straight-hanging valleys.  Soft fabric."
4.0,"It's about 1.2 inches closed up and 3 opened all the way. Feels solid. Not a real telescope, but fun with a costume."
4.0,No complaints got these for my 4yr old daughter and they fit fine but will probably glue some felt over the metal parts showing  so they don't leave a mark on her head! :)
4.0,"Nice Pendulum.  The chain is a little light weight, pendulum seems light compared to others I have gotten.  But the pendulum actually works great and it's pretty!  I would order again."
4.0,My nephew loved the shoes the only negative thing was that I paid for it to be gift wrapped but it wasn't.
4.0,Super cute and comfortable-just a little too long for me being 5'3 I need to wear it with heels or wedges-other than that I love the way it fits and is super comfy on my 6month pregnant bellly
4.0,Cute but not for long wearing the backing is very uncomfortable .
4.0,"Nice hat, but warmer than a normal ball cap."
4.0,"Super cute, but I don't like how the tassels curl up.  Her other pair doesn't do this."
4.0,I had to return - my fault - too many hooks - but they looked good so I ordered the right ones.
4.0,"I received the jacket with a logo that is partially unattached and marred.  Not damaged in shipping.  The jacket also had a number of loose threads that I needed to cut off.<br /><br />Besides that I find that the jacket, size large, fits really well for my six foot frame.  It is comfortable against the skin, and unlike cotton does not make you feel clammy when you start getting warm.  I find this to be a great lightweight jacket to wear in the car on a cold day with the car heater on and running errands where you are not having to be in the cold for too long, as it is lightweight and does not provide a ton of warmth.<br /><br />I also like the fact that the care instructions are very easy and after its first washer and dryer cycle still looks brand new."
4.0,"i like how this bag is fold-able and comes with a small storage bag. Its big. Fits mine and my boyfriends clothes for a three day trip. I give it a 4-star only coz it doesnt seem sturdy enough. Its not exactly flimsy. Its made in between. But the bag itself is light and can be carried several ways, shoulder bag and backpack. Worth the price. A good buy for me."
4.0,I get so many compliments on these.  I love them!
4.0,"Very nice outerwear for early fall. 5'6, 155lbs and small fits perfect. Looks and feels great. The only fault with this product is the hood. It is way too large and falls all over your face- flabby would be a good word to describe it. Hence the 4star rating. Other than the hood, very happy with the product."
4.0,The dress fits as expected in certain area. Around the neck area however it’s fits big. I don’t like that part but otherwise the dress is ok.
4.0,"The dress was better than expected.  It's a bit thin, so you have to wear a Slip under it."
4.0,"These pajamas are comfortable and cute.  They are short on my arms and legs.  I don't know if this is the intention of the designer, but when I wake up and look in the mirror, I wonder if I grew a few inches overnight.<br /><br />The care instructions state this:<br /><br />Wash Cold in Delicate Laundry Bag<br />Hang to Dry<br /><br />The buttons have a really pretty shell enamel, and a spare button comes in the package.  The fabric is really soft.  The garment's construction is great for both the pants and the shirt."
4.0,"I just unpacked the puffer jacket and the XL was a bit smaller than other XL coats I own.  However, it is a puffer and should fit a little smaller than usual. I does not fold up small enough to fit into the little bag that came with the shipment. The coat seems warm, but I will know how warm it actually is when I travel to Minnesota next week.  Overall, it seems like a good coat for the money.  The only oddity is the left side zipper."
4.0,Bought this for my husband who does a lot of yard work  he loves it  but runs a little small
4.0,Really beautiful. Love it!
4.0,I’ve purchased this shirt in two colors and I love them both. They wash great and I haven’t had them fade at all. Great fit as well.
4.0,It is a little big on my wrist but i have very small wrists.  Good quality though and I get lots of compliments.
4.0,The top is nice for working out it mine was too small. I got the largest they had but it was still too small for me. So I would say go up a size or two.
4.0,"I have rheumatoid arthritis which effects my feet as well as other joints. I wanted a slipper that had a good amount of cushioning, a slip on & a good gripping sole. Would definitely recommend for others to purchase."
4.0,Received it 2 day ago and was scared to try it on it looked like it might of ran small. But it fit perfectly.. I love the length and the one cold shoulder is so cute. I order it for a family beach vacation and this is exactly what I wanted
4.0,"The pants don't come all the way down, im 5'8."
4.0,Okay for the money.
4.0,"Cute shoes, 99% comfortable, but loud on hard floors. I sound like a horse clopping my way down the hall. Otherwise, they're great!"
4.0,"This dress was really pretty, and I wanted to be able to wear it, but after looking at the guide on their images and my sizes (16/18) I bought an XXL which was still to small. If this dress fit the cut was pleasing, through a little shorter then I has hoped, but would have kept it.<br /><br />This product was provided at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review."
4.0,"The romper fit as expected. However, it was see through. I had to wear black underwear and a black tank underneath."
4.0,"Honestly I always wanted to have a Japanese school outfit so I'm really happy with my purchase. The only problem that I had was that the skirt was a little tight but I managed to fit into it and the shirt was perfect( a little see through but with a tank top underneath that shouldn't be a problem). So yeah, it came with a little gift too(a gold sticker that you can put in your phone or computer) and was exactly as shown in the picture ^-^. Great buy!!"
4.0,A must for those with Reynauds. Especially when in another person's home or at any function you have to attend.
4.0,"It's a cute jacket and warm, but it does run small. I was sorry that I didn't get it in a bigger size, so I could layer clothes under it. That said, it really is cute and comfortable looking exactly as shown."
4.0,"For the price of these earrings, they are pretty nice. The color is a bit dull , and not and bright as the picture portrays. The size of the earring is like a button on a dress shirt so it isnt very noticeable nor will i think it will get you much compliments.<br /><br />Another than that its a good buy in my opinion !"
4.0,"So comfy! A little small, but I’m a tall person so that is to be expected. Love the material. Silky and soft!"
4.0,"I like it, good quality for the price."
4.0,Fits wider /slightly larger than a lot of 3x men's athletic shirts ! Which is a plus but almost too big for my husband who is a 3x.  A few threads coming out of the sleeve but we cut them and the hemming is fine. Print looks nice . Decent shirt .
4.0,The lenses didn’t last a week and not that comfortable
4.0,"It is a fine purchase.  It has striking stones and is well liked by the women of my life.  Not 5 star because it is just a casual bracelet that does not seem overly more durable than any other ""flexible"" jewelry out there.  No attempt to go with a noticeably higher quality band.  But still well worth the purchase."
4.0,Super cute. Strong material. This dies ship from China so it took about a month but it was a fun surprise when it did show up.
4.0,"I like this comfortable hat to wear when it is chilly, but not freezing cold. It's very soft & can fit in my large purse."
4.0,"Specs: for me 5'5&quot; 200lbs Bust 45&quot; Waist 42&quot; Hips 45&quot; I'm broad but not busty 38B. I wear a 14/16 in David's bridal dress sizes.<br />So I love the dress, quality was great, color was great. I ordered two different styles in purple size 16. I was afraid they wouldn't fit based on the measurements but having reading several reviews and seeing actual pictures I thought I would give it a shot. Unfortunately they did not fit. I could hook the clasp but couldn't zip all the way up. If I wore really tall heels I wouldn't need to hem. In bare feet at least two inches or more of the outter sheer is in the floor. The inner layer not too bad. There IS a difference in length. One extra note this top could be worn without a bra as there is plenty of lining inside. It holds its shape great for a strapless, doesn't roll or slide down. The dress is really lovely I just wish they had it in my size :( 16 is the largest they have and it doesn't work."
4.0,"Love this product. It arrived in excellent condition, but was not boxed as expected."
4.0,"Very cute, I have bad knees, so I can't wear them where I will be walking all day. I wouldn't wear them for shopping, only because of my health issues. But they are very cute."
4.0,They wear tight at the toe line. Comfortable in all other places but are taking a bit of time to break in with the toe issue.
4.0,Very cute earrings my mom liked it
4.0,Love the top...sometimes the holes for your shoulders shift and my bra strap shows. That is kinda annoying but not enough for me to send it back. I like it a a lot!
4.0,My 7 year old niece went crazy over this purple Heart one  i got her.
4.0,"This dress was actually very pretty, but just didn't work well with my body type. I did  notice that the sequins irritated my skin when I put it on, so I don't think I could have lasted all night in this dress either way."
4.0,"This is a  nice quality bag. Like all Loungefly products,it’s made very well. The embroidery is lovely. It’s a little larger than other tote purses I’ve had. The price was cheaper than anywhere else. My only negative comment is that it has a very strong perfume smell. It smells like incense. I’ve used it for a few weeks and I can still smell it. It doesn’t bother me but someone who is more sensitive to scents might have an issue."
4.0,It works well but the hat size is ginormous. My husband has a pretty big head and it's still huge on him. So it basically looks kind of awkward but still works.
4.0,Love it very flattering
4.0,I do not recommend for anyone with a longer torso.  It was short on my husband.
4.0,A little smaller than what I normally get for XL. Probably closer to a Large. But a pretty nice shirt.
4.0,Great little bags. Perfect for my kids to use on vacation. They also used them for Halloween!!!
4.0,I like the design of the dress but the fit was more stretchy than tshirt.
4.0,I wear it all the time which means it can get dirty fast. I tried to clean it with basic soap and water and the stains do not come off. I even used Clorox wipes and the stains will not come off. I really like the white look but I will have to reconsider getting another color next time.
4.0,Super cute. Wish they would have came in individual bags for storage
4.0,"Durable material. Nice length, and the straps aren't too long. The straps have these little button clasps on the ends, and those came off after the first or second trip through the washer. Kind of a useless feature if you ask me, I just tied off a knot to keep it from fraying."
4.0,"My daughter is almost 3 and LOVES to wear her earrings! With her being so young she typically leaves them on/ leaves them alone but if she does take them off it’s not sticky to put them back, you can try but they’ll consistently fall of from there. Overall they’re cute and she loves them"
4.0,"Worked great for a monster trucks show. Now the kid wants to wear them any time he's around anything even remotely loud, so that's as good a sign as any."
4.0,Wanted readers for screen use. These are comfortable and help with the amount of time I spend on screens.
4.0,"The bunny is very cute and soft, but we were expecting a black and white bow tie.  The bunny came with a lime green and white bow tie instead"
4.0,"I keep forgetting that this company does not make a size that fits me. I will either return it or buy a book on how the tailor, as we are currently practicing social distancing. I'm not even remarkably thin, just had a baby, so there are parts of me that are quite... generous. Still, this small is too big. Very pretty, well made, but if you are 5'00"", around 115 lbs, even the smallest dress won't fit you. Beautiful dress, just disappointed."
4.0,"I ordered a medium because some reviews said to go a size up and I’m a size 4/6 and always wear small. Oh god it’s humongous, there’s oversized look which is what I was going for but this can fit two of me inside. I’m 5’6 and the jacket swallowed me up. Now I have to return it and get a small and hopefully will fit. Small girls  Don’t go a size up unless you want to look like you borrowed it from your professional football player boyfriend. The quality is great, very warm and looks expensive. That’s why I’m giving it another shot."
4.0,"I am 5'9"" and 160 lbs. This dress fits perfect in the Medium I ordered. The length is right below my ankles. The pockets are in a nice placement."
4.0,"These slippers get the job done. They fit as expected and are warm, comfortable, and soft. However, the biggest drawback seems to be the support. It's claimed to be memory foam, but when I walk I can feel the sole of my foot pressing on the bottom plastic part of the shoe - which I shouldn't be able to feel with proper padding. Again, it's fine for just keeping your feet warm around the house, but I don't expect that these will last a particularly long time or be super durable."
4.0,I love mine and I received it faster than the expected time .
4.0,"These slippers are so much better than the fake suede ones from Walmart, which I had to throw away because the fake suede made my feet sweat.<br />These slippers are very comfortable. I wish they had real sheep wool lining but probably not possible at $20 bucks.<br />A good buy."
4.0,Very well made but too small and didn’t like the elastic in the sleeve
4.0,"The ring definitely met my expectations! It's very cool & it was shipped in good time! I would recommend this ring to anybody who's into goth, punk, etc.!"
4.0,"These are used everyday when working in the yard.  They are slightly tight, but not enough to be a problem.  They are super absorbant  and the elastic properties are superb."
4.0,"I wish I could have kept these gloves, however, (as stated in the description), they run small.  Unfortunately, I had to return them. 😞"
4.0,"I love it. It seems pretty sturdy and it doesn’t look cheap. I liked that I was able to take out a few links because I have really small wrists. The only thing I don’t like is that the band is a slightly different gold than the watch cover. However, it is barely noticeable and no one else has seemed to notice the difference."
4.0,Well made with a draw string.<br /><br />** I don't like the length on the thighs. Too short<br /><br />**. SUPER SNUG !!! I had a 33 waist and bought the XXL/2xl that was rated at 32-35. You may consider sizing up to be comfy
4.0,Very comfortable. I like it.
4.0,"It's pretty, but a little big & chunky.  If that doesn't bother you, it's a nice watch made with nice wood."
4.0,"Not long enough to be a Rapunzel braid, but just fine for generic princess (kid is average height 5yo). A bit awkward trying to make it secure and seamless, but overall a very good item."
4.0,No shrinkage in cold water wash.
4.0,I wasn't expecting the black stripes to be a netting that you can sort of see through but it's not bad.
4.0,although it was exactly what I was looking for I was disappointed that it was so thin that my hair stuck through it! lol!  but a great summer shirt for wear on a breezy evening!
4.0,I love this charm. It's just the right size. Will order more. Pretty
4.0,Good Quality fits tight
4.0,"Cute fit! I’d order the skirt again, but I just didn’t like the material of the shirt."
4.0,The dress was nicely made; I just didn’t think it looked flattering on me.
4.0,Very cute... kinda sharp
4.0,Great for hanging around the house. Little larger than I expected.
4.0,It’s too large if you are petite.
4.0,"These are cute but they're like legging material, so the zippers will cause pulls and picks. I don't think I'll buy these again for that fact but that's not really the pants' fault."
4.0,Took forever to get here but... I LOVE IT! May get more colors!
4.0,"Really fun outfit and super comfortable. It came out a little bigger than expected, but overall I'm happy with it. It's also very warm, but also lose and airy between the buttons."
4.0,"I like the socks. They fit well and are comfortable and warm. (I'm tempted to buy another pair exactly like them so that they can match....but they look like they belong together, so not really.) I'm just not sure how well they will hold up. They seem like they will get a hole sooner than other socks that cost this much. I've only warn them twice, so I'll update the review after a few more wearings."
4.0,like the soft material and the warmth when wearing it
4.0,I like the long straps but I have a big head so I need at least an extra 1/2 inch
4.0,"I received so many complements on this dress!  It is a gorgeous color and drapes well.  It laundered well and even tumbled dry.  My only concern was how thin the fabric is, and I made sure to wear it with a slip underneath."
4.0,"I haven't worn it yet,  haven't even tried it I'm.  But it's cute,  really cute.  Once I at least try it on I'll come back with a Better review & pictures"
4.0,Received in good order and timely  However about 6 inches in width and length would have earned a 5 star.  Note: to self check measurements before buying.  Otherwise it is a great bag to have.  I will just need to hang on to my old bag for those once a month supermarket value runs.
4.0,"I really like it ! It’s shorter in the front then the back. That’s perfect for me because I’m not very tall,Some of the other dresses I’ve gotten off of Amazon are so long I have to tie a knot to be able to wear them without tripping."
4.0,"I love the hi-low fit, it is perfect for some jeans and heels."
4.0,"Good fit, a tad cheap but a decent pair for the price.  Blocks wind good. Not sure how it will hold up after time"
4.0,Lightweight and kinda silky soft material! Pattern is really pretty! Only con is the top doesn't have any pockets.
4.0,Fits a little snugger than I would prefer but I like it.
4.0,"These socks are really cute. I got the powder blue ones. The compression is the right amount of tightness for me, the only problem being at the top end. I wasn't sure what size sock to choose. I wear a 71/2 or 8 women's shoe, but my running shoes are 81/2 or 9's. So i went with the size 8-10's. They would be fine except that they come up to the top of my kneecaps. This is a literal pain, especially on longer runs. They really cut into the back of my knees. If I were to order again, I'd go with the smaller size. I will probably use these more often after runs or when I'll be doing a lot of sitting, like on airplanes."
4.0,very pretty but see through
4.0,I like it. Fabric is soft and doesn't look really tight on even though it doesn't have good stretch.
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:19604ede246e20c90f0e2c04d1cc1fa1]] The dress is super comfy. Thin and lite. I am 5'4, roughly 160lbs. I ordered 2 sizes up!"
4.0,I had to hot glue the hair because it's barely on there. But it was cheap and looks good. My son had fun on Halloween in this.
4.0,Great watch and great price
4.0,"I like the blue color, however the sleeves are a bit snug."
4.0,"I have the same size sweater in red but with a different label on it, that sweater is a bit larger and flows better. This sweater is shorter in the arms and a tighter fit."
4.0,Sleeves are super long
4.0,Nice bag with decent sized pockets
4.0,The necklace is very pretty. It’s a little chunkier than I thought and I wish I’d looked more closely at the length-would’ve like a longer necklace. It was a gift and she loved it.
4.0,This is big enough to fit an adult male! Good quality though.
4.0,"The coloration was excellent and matched the watch perfectly. It was not an exact fit to the Timex watch, I had to modify ends so I could have room for the pins to fit. All in all, the band was a great addition to the watch. I would buy another like it. Cliff"
4.0,Pretty color! Accidently purchase 2 I will give the other as a birthday present to girlfriend!!
4.0,This mask is a very nice print but runs very large both horizontally and vertically.  It is more suitable for a large face.
4.0,I thought this would fade in time but ine still looks like new after more than a month of use. I can wear this day and night. It comes with a great price too!
4.0,"Very nice little keychain--I bought it to attach to the end of a Totoro umbrella for my friend and she adored it.<br />The keychain is rubber and very sturdy, but with rubber the colors bleed a little, so keep this in mind before you buy. Personally, I think this is fine, but the one in the picture is a bit more pristine than what you will actually get.<br />Also, although it is hard to see, there is a second rubber piece on the chain: a tiny rubber paw print. Very cute."
4.0,"Wish it was a bit longer, I'm only four months pregnant and I can't see this lasting the whole pregnancy as stomach gets larger. I'm only 5'3 by the way."
4.0,"The pros:  Fits well although this product is made in China, so I'd recommend ordering large.  I ordered about two sizes larger than what I'd normally wear and it fits fine.  Nice drape and length and comfortable fabric.  The needs improvements:  Photos don't really portray the prints accurately, in my opinion.  I was a bit surprised, especially by the yellow one. It's a brilliant print, more of ""bird of paradise"" colors than the blue, red, and white it looks like in the product description.  The yellow is brighter, and the blue is more of a aqua green with reddish orange highlights.  It looks very tropical.  I haven't worn or laundered them yet, so I can't speak to the concerns about pilling.  I'm sure I'll enjoy wearing these dresses (I bought two) even though they don't look exactly like I expected."
4.0,A little weird fitting around the boobs but I love how the leggings don’t rub up against the genital area like others. It doesn’t have that awkward stitch line in the middle. And the hubby likes how it looks on me
4.0,i liked the setting of the jewels the owl is very cute giving it as a gift to a friend for christman
4.0,"The belt seems to be made from good leather and it actually came with some tools for punching extra holes in the belt which I thought was a really awesome idea.  However the metal part of the blt just seemed a bit cheap.  It had that loose light feeling.  Not that it will pop open or anything, it's solid in that respect, I just would have liked to have seen something a bit more eye catching or impressive.  However for those that just want a good belt that does the job,  this is the one for you."
4.0,These fit great and they are lined so they seem to hold you in better.
4.0,"Cute, soft, and is long enough to be used as a belt! I’m a size 12/13 jeans."
4.0,"Love the shirt, fits a bit small."
4.0,"Pretty top but cut slim through the torso and arms, would be great if you are built this way.  The hem and neckline is laser cut and doesn't ravel (it would seem) but isn't sewn if that makes a difference.  Fabric is good, design is good, just the fit is specific to a body type."
4.0,"The shoes look great . 3 lights went out on both shoes in the first week, but my daughter said that the lights that went out matched on both shoes, she didn't care, lol."
4.0,bargain at this price
4.0,"I have to say that I was very pleased with these glasses. They were the perfect size and in perfect condition. One thing I didn't appreciate was the absence of the micro fiber bag. My glasses only came in what appeared to be a little clear Ziploc bag. That false advertisement was quite a dissappointment, besides that everything was great."
4.0,thank you for the socks.
4.0,"They are nice, but they run too big. I am 50 years old, i weigh 140 pounds and i ordered a small, and they fit like a Medium. Would love it if they made these in an extra small, that's probably what i need. But still okay for the price...  Product is exactly as pic"
4.0,Coat was a little bigger than expected
4.0,Overall seems to be the quality you’d get for this price. One of the rings came with the gem popped out. All others are intact and seem to be ok quality. Has not turned green or given a reaction to my skins and the one I’ve been wearing hasn’t broken despite being pressed on by my jeans all day.
4.0,"Super cute, flattering and fits well.  As explained in other reviews, don't expect this to really close over the middle.  Fit is exactly as pictured on the model.  I'm very busty, but the top felt secure and supportive but not overly snug.  Comfortable, soft and flattering.  Great price.  If they carried it in more colors, I'd buy others!"
4.0,Cool rings
4.0,I liked this but I didn't love it. It is a PU leather but it feels very synthetic. It was however very light weight and fit everything I needed in it very well. I haven't been using it all that long so I cannot say much for it's durability but it seems structurally sound and very functional.
4.0,These are great because they do not break easily and the Polarized lenses do make a difference!  I throw my sunglasses in my purse and have ruined many pairs!  These are flexible and very sturdy.  My only complaint is that the lenses are a little small and do not provide complete coverage for bright sun.
4.0,To hold up my jeans!
4.0,Really cute. I would have liked it if it was a darker brown
4.0,"These do NOT run small.  They run pretty true to size considering they are supposed to be slightly oversized, flowy pajamas.  The fabric is amazingly soft and the design is adorable!  My only complaint is how long the shorts are.  If I pull them up to wear as high-waisted shorts, they are still too long to be cute.  If I wear them on my hips the way I prefer, they are an awkward long length.  Other than that, these are great pajamas!  For reference, I ordered XS and am wearing them in my photos.  I’m 5’4”, 96lbs, D cup chest.  XS would be my usual size, and XS is too big on me, so I do not recommend sizing up."
4.0,Work well for the price.
4.0,These earrings are a great size. I was looking for safety pin earrings for awhile but all the ones that I came across were too big. These were a good size and the silver color is beautiful. They are really easy to put on. The only small complaint that I have is that the latch on the earring feels a little flimsy so you do have to be careful taking the earring off and putting on so as not to break it. Other than this the shipper was fast and the item came in a very pretty box.
4.0,I have two girls.  Different body types! One more thicker in the stomach and taller by an inch. My other regular meaning not skinny not chunky smaller by 13 pounds and one inches. The largest size fits both comfortable. Weird I know but very true they love these outfits!!! For warmer wear!!!! They do shrink a little!!
4.0,Looks luxurious and fit perfectly!
4.0,My head size is exactly at the break from medium and large according to your chart so it was a gamble either way.
4.0,I think the design is perfect! It matches just about everything and comfortable. It seems durable for the price that I paid.<br /><br />I did have to remove several links which was a bit difficult to figure out and kind of feel it’s alittle to tight but adding one would be alittle lose. However this will depend on wrist size.
4.0,"shipping was normal. I like it. look just exactly like the photo. fabric is cheap, and easy rip."
4.0,"This top fits great - I normally wear 16/18 in tops and ordered an XL. The fit is great, the top drapes nicely and hides any unsightly bulges while looking feminine. The material is soft and lightweight, great for summer! The only reason I took away 1 star is because the material is somewhat see-through.  I am wearing a black bra underneath this navy blue top, and can somewhat see the outline of the bra under the top in certain light. It doesn't totally show, like &#34;here is my bra&#34; but you can sometimes see the top portion of my bra through the top in certain lights (my bathroom soft white light). Overall though, it's a great top, I plan to buy more, and would definitely recommend this to others.  [[ASIN:B0714DRNQR Solatin Women's Cross V Neck Tank Tops Summer Flowy Sleeveless Tunic (X-Large, Navy Blue)]]"
4.0,The earrings are very lovely but are made from extremely thin material. Easy to bend but truly pretty on and off.
4.0,Was just what I wanted. Perfect for the gift it was meant to be.
4.0,"They were a bit heavy and I broke+lost them at an end show (my own fault), but besides their weight they were absolutely amazing! Will probably by again once I have the money in my pocket."
4.0,I am usually a small or medium. I had to get large in order to sit like a small or medium
4.0,"Very cute, super soft, but it is extremely thin. I’ll probably wear some leggings and a tank top underneath for modesty. But incredibly comfortable!"
4.0,Worked great for my daughter in law on her wedding day to my son.
4.0,They fit well and I don't know if its because its a 6 year old wearing them or not but they don't hold up that great.  I bought them just a few months ago and they are already coming apart by the laces somewhat.
4.0,"Nice fabric, a very light jacket"
4.0,Love these just too big. Do not go by the size chart
4.0,"Thankfully, I've never had to truly 'test' this vest but having worn it on quite a few rides I can say that I feel a bit safer with it on. It's a bit bulky so don't expect it to fit under your jacket unless its a little loose. Covers your back from the base of your next down to your tailbone. Fits securely with velcro straps and doesn't shift. The chest 'protector' is pretty small- it's about the 6x5 inches and centered over the sternum."
4.0,"These are attractive leather wrist bands that fit my husband's medium sized wrist with room to spare before adjusting the clasp.  If the clasp requires adjusting, the product photos show clearly how to adjust it.  Although these wrist bands appear to be promo'd and geared toward males, I am of the opinion that they would serve great for both males or females depending upon the style of jewelry the customer enjoys wearing.<br /><br />One of the bands has some jewelry that slides along the band very freely.  The other band has a couple of silver looking pieces but they don't slide and are held securely in place by the thin bands that form part of the decorative look of the wrist band.<br /><br />One caveat.  There is an unpleasant odor to both bracelets.  Not sure if it is due to the raw leather or the packaging.  I don't smell the odor on the velvet bag - only on the bracelets.  Hopefully, the odor will go away after being aired or worn for awhile. I'm deleting one star for this odor.<br /><br />All in all, I am of the opinion these wrist bands are fairly well made, and are a great buy at the current price.  Sample was provided for my unbiased review."
4.0,Cute little Totem bag.  The pink and blue fringe was kinda tacky but I removed it.
4.0,Nice. Thought it would be longer as pictured but still nice.
4.0,Love the slimness. Not a fan of the band
4.0,"Material is thin, but I wasn't expecting much based on the price. Honestly ordered it just for a &quot;photo op&quot; with my daughter who has a similar suit!<br />The breast area is very large and gapping as was the back area. I ordered a size larger than i usually wear based on the measurements on the size-chart - but that was a mistake! I have sent back and ordered a size smaller, so hoping it fits better!"
4.0,Fits well just thin
4.0,I like them but had to return for smaller size. I normally wear 8 in flats but they were too big and returned for a 7.5
4.0,Great pants for yoga! The only reason I didn't give them a 5 is they are just a little see through.
4.0,Nice winter hat. Made of 100% polyester. Soft fur. The one downfall 8 found was for a woman's hat the straps for chin are long.
4.0,"Love it!  Colorful, longer top with enough material  to hide tummy!"
4.0,I absolutely love this outfit my girl looks so stinkin cute in it and she was comfy in it to no pulling at her clothes witch usually she does almost constantly I was very pleased with my choice this year the pants were a bit bigger than I expected but we rolled them up an they worked just fine
4.0,"Color is brighter than the picture; I expected a softer pink, and it is very bright. Fits a little oddly on me, but I am definitely plus-sized. When paired with a bolero or short jacket, it does the trick."
4.0,"Fits great, though skirt length is a little long. (I'm 5'4&#34;) I will probably get it hemmed but otherwise will be a great summer dress."
4.0,A bit too large. Ordered medium for size 36C.
4.0,Very good at being concerned with your item will tarnish but they will replace! Very responsive
4.0,"I ordered this in the silt color choice. The band that came with the fit bit 3 was uncomfortable so I picked out two, one in leather and this one.  This one is so light I don't even realize I have it on, it attaches solidly to the fitbit and was easy to switch out.  The only negative comment I have is the pieces that secure it to the fitbit are plastic,  the leather band I ordered has metal, and in this case the silt color band comes with an ugly peachy/ pink plastic that doesn't go with the rose gold color of the fit bit, that being said I will keep it but read the description a little better on the next one I order."
4.0,Wow these shades are pretty cool! Definitely hipster with some vintage style going on. I'm digging it! They do feel cheap as the other reviews stated and I don't feel like they're worth $15. Maybe $10 but they are different than any other pair of shades I have so I'll keep them. They do come with a quality case which is nice.
4.0,I thought the watch was nice except the buttons holding together was different then the hardware the stray on:(.
4.0,I liked that it fit me perfect for the size i chose.
4.0,Adorable and super soft!  0-6 month which is a Chinese 80 fits my average build 7 month old (18lbs).  Pants are a little long but I rolled them and it looks super cute!  So definitely size down and you'll be fine!  Not for stalky chubby babies for sure though!
4.0,I bought them for my husband.. The love them. He said they are very comfortable.. He even take with him on business trips. I bought them a size up the do run a little small
4.0,"Nice looking as described, only reason not a five the chain was a bit to thin"
4.0,A little more see through than expected
4.0,These were bought as gifts for a Birthday on June 22nd they look very nice I they look like they will fit. I will know more after that.
4.0,"Not too sturdy, looks cheap"
4.0,Cute swimsuit....unless you have back fat / rolls.  Then you will be disappointed.  It strap hits exactly where I'd prefer it not to.  I'm not sure if I am going to return because I really like how it fits in the front but the back isn't exactly what I expected.
4.0,"So nice I bought 2. I hope they don't outlast the Benrus commemorative Vietnam watch it goes on. Is as close as I could find, but not as well made as the O.D. green canvas band this watch originally came with. Has been durable."
4.0,"I recommend this necklace/watch. The price is fabulous, shipping is standard snail mail, but for less than $10 you get a non-wrist based watch that works and looks nice. I do have to say that the only reason this didn't get a 5 star rating is due to there being no directions on how to set the watch. It was simple enough though...<br /><br />You will have to pull the head pin till it clicks into position and then twist the hand as expected and push the head pin back down."
4.0,"I haven't truly worn these yet, but the reason I eliminated a star is because these are not made for short people. I'm 5'1&#34;, and I think you need to be at least 5'5&#34; if these are going to fit. Also, they're pretty stiff out of the box, and from being bundled up, they don't stay stay straight when wearing them, kind of twisted, though they may be better on a person that they actually fit on. Otherwise, the light functions work great. Nice and bright blue."
4.0,"Looks decently made, but docking 1 star because I measure them to be 1.4mm in diameter, and not 1.5mm as claimed.<br /><br />Also, I'll echo a tip I read in the comments in case it gets lost.  The case consists of a top and bottom half, taped all around when it arrives.  If you cut all around and pull them apart, be very careful as you risk jolting the spring bars out of their slots and you'll be in for a bad day.  Instead, cut around the sides and the front only.  The remaining tape on the back will serve as a hinge."
4.0,"These things are pretty amazing for what they do. It literally moves as if I didn't have the gloves on! However, I have pretty large hands, and it feels a little weird near the base of my fingers. Every time I put them on, it feels almost like I am going to rip something. Not really sure what it is though."
4.0,"Arrived a week early which was great, I got the grey and color was exact to the picture. They were a little bigger than I expected but at least my daughter can wear them longer. They are SO cute. I plan to buy more."
4.0,fun and a great product
4.0,I very much like the earrings. They are well made with set stones. They are sectioned rather than being stiff. My only concern was when I opened the package which was slender to find the posts bent. I gently pushed the posts straight with no breakage.
4.0,Elastic band is really tight. Would go one size up and stretch it out before wearing. Other than that I love it! I plan on getting more in different colors!
4.0,"These are really pretty but not the dark stainless steel that I am used to. They look more like a sterling silver to me. So, I hope they are actually stainless steel as advertised. I am allergic to other metals. I am disappointed because  the earrings I got were not the same. The stem was significantly longer on one of the earrings than the other. See photo. Unfortunately, I will have to return them.<br /><br />*Update*  I ordered another pair and the second pair matched and looked just like the ad  photo. These look really pretty and sleek on but again are much lighter color metal than my other stainless steel earrings...see second photo. I prefer the darker platinum looking stainless steel. Only 4 stars because of the light color and because the metal stamp is on the same side of each earring which means on one ear, the metal stamp is visible to others. This is clearly a design flaw... the metal stamp, if necessary at all, should be on the inside of each earring. In fairness to the seller, the earrings are pictured this way in the ad photo but I was hoping it was a mistake. I would for sure by another pair if they ever fix this design defect."
4.0,"This is a nice rosary.  I wanted one for the car and wanted one with better beads and chain than the free one I had there.  This rosary is exactly what I needed in that regard.  The two Our Father beads at the beginning are not much bigger than the Hail Mary beads, and there is little space between the five longer Our Father beads and the Hail Mary beads, so it's a little awkward for the Glory Be, but you get used to it.  For the price this is a very nice item.  I prefer my Vatican Gifts rosary, but it's good to have one at hand always.<br /><br />The oddity is that there is a figure of Our Lord on both sides of the crucifix.  I don't think that this is religiously significant or wrong, but I could not find an answer online and so I could be mistaken.  It struck me as a bit strange, but it does not stop me using it."
4.0,"Initially, they were hard to get on.  Really had to roll the socks to the top of the toe, then they went on like a glove… they are comfortable and wear them often."
4.0,"I'm a huge Vonnegut fan, so I couldn't pass this up.  The necklace is beautiful, well-made, and has an excellent clasp with a choice of length, so if you're like me then you won't have the charm hanging halfway to your stomach.  My only problem is that the chain started to turn my skin green; I had to swap most of it for another chain, although I kept the clasp and the length that hangs down my back because it was so pretty (and doesn't rub enough to react with the skin).  Problem easily solved (and one I'm used to from a lot of other jewelry, that's just how my skin is.)"
4.0,They are comfortable and look like they will last.
4.0,"Pretty good pair of pants. Exactly what I expected. Being somehow water repellent is definitely a nice future if you happen to be outdoors in a small rain or a drizzle.<br />The only think negative so far is the fact that they are not really breathable. They may not be perfect pair on a hot, humid day and definitely not warm enough on a cold one.<br />All in all, I am happy with my purchase (after all, I ordered 2 more pairs)."
4.0,The ring is nice but runs small and since it was a gift and I ordered early I have missed the window to return it so money wasted.
4.0,These were perfect size out of the package but after washing they got SO small I could hardly put them on my feet without them coming off. After wash through the day they do expand again but wish they didn't switch as much (my only complaint). I generally hate these kinds of socks but LOVE the material these are made out of. They are very comfortable to wear and the first kind I've ever had that doesn't fall off the heel. I'm usually fixing the socks all day long but not with these! I never have to pull them back on.
4.0,A lil smaller than expected but theyre ok.
4.0,"Really like this cardigan. Nice medium weight, great design. I'm 5'2'' with medium length arms and the arms were about 1.5 inches too long but for the price, I'm perfectly okay with it."
4.0,The hat was a little small and the shirt was very large and wide. I sewed it from inside approximately and inch from both sides to make more fit and thighter. Overall worked great for a Halloween costume
4.0,"These appear to be well made and have held up so far after a few months of wear.  The sizing was confusing to me.  There is 2-3 year size and a 4-5 year.  My son is 3 and right at the 50th percentile so I wasn’t sure what size to choose.  There was no sizing chart, just waist measurements so I chose a 2-3 year based on that measurement and that in other brands he can wear 2-3 year underwear.  I’m keeping them even though they seem a little on the small size (the look more like underpants than boxer briefs as a result)."
4.0,Very comfortable great fit I am short but the length is just right
4.0,Great shorts but fit someone large. Order a size down and you’ll love them.
4.0,"I think it's a bit overpriced for the size, its tiny! of the actual ring but overall I'm pleased with my purchase!"
4.0,"I am returning because too large for me. The color is really nice ,and its pretty close to real  leather. 4 stars because I am returning it."
4.0,"The design is adorable, but the fascinator is very small - so much so that the ornaments do not show vividly, as they do in the picture. It is very fragile. I have a large head, so it barely covers the top, but even those with small heads might find it is smaller than they expected.<br />I gave it four stars because it's a nice alternative for fancy dress, when one wants inexpensive options. I paired this with trousers and an orange top, and wore one of the Halloween capes on Amazon. I essentially love the design, were it of better quality and not so small. The headband is not strong - I had to secure it with hair clips."
4.0,Love them I use as backup shoes when my feet heart from my high heels when I perform at Rocky Horror
4.0,"The hat is fine, adjustable and all that.  The colors are great, tans and browns, but I wish hat manufacturers would let you “curve” your own bill.  This one is too curved and fits a little weirdly on my head.  Would have been better to have let me do it."
4.0,"Looks great, careful that the little screws on the clips don't work themselves out"
4.0,"I thought it was great, arrived on time and everything, but I bought this for my girlfriend and she said it was nice but it wasn't the wine red color like it was stated. I don't know, maybe she's crazy but the scarf was very nice."
4.0,"Another iteration on the smart watch / hybrid design. More like the Michael Kors design and less like the full on digital Diesel style.<br />It depends on your taste I guess, this is as good as a dress watch, and as functional as a day to day watch with probably enough smart watch features for the casual user.<br />At a glance steps or workout goal on the smaller dial, and pretty much everything else is done through the app on your phone.<br />Big big plus as far as I'm concerned is one year battery life and NO charging every few days, that's great.<br />Good price too, and certainly cheaper than the other two aformentioned brands.<br /><br />Lot of information on the Fossil site as shown below, couple of negatives as water resistance is only 5ATM and warranty coverage is pretty scant.<br />Apart from that I rated it 4 stars.<br />NOTIFICATIONS<br />Our smartwatches use Bluetooth® technology to connect to your phone.

4.0,Beautiful beads and I haven't figured out how to adjust the bracelet so I haven't been able to use it yet but it's pretty
4.0,My 9 year old sons are very into the avengers and this is great accessory for creative play for them. Does not come with a keychain as shown.  Took a long time to arrive.
4.0,Very thin material. Made it seem like it has bust support. None whatsoever.
4.0,They do what they're supposed to but they do pull off sometimes if you're not easy with they when zipping up your coat.
4.0,"Fit as expected. Color is true to the photo. I'm not used to the stirrups but after adjusting my socks I was fine. They are a cotton material and if you do sweat at the gym, people WILL see. But overall happy with my purchase for the price."
4.0,These socks really help to keep swelling down.  They work as expected.  I will say that I wish there was a larger size available and that they were a little easier to get on.  I have also had some issues with the top band tearing after a couple of wash and wears; this could be because they are so hard to get on.
4.0,For the price is a nice gift
4.0,"Really changed the way I daily carry the things in my wallet. I never knew how cluttered my old one was until I picked up this wallet. I chose the blue because of the unique color. The wallet has some fairly nice feeling leather. The suggestions of where to put your cards are almost accurate. I can only place 3 card in the top pocket without struggling to pull them out with the tab. Front pocket can hold only 1 card. The back I use to put 3 extra cards and cash. It can can only fit about 5-10 bill without looking bulky. I think the choice of a money clip would definitely be a great option in a future design. Overall, I am very satisfied with this product! I will update on how well it last in 6 months or year!"
4.0,"Anvil tees and tanks are true to size and fit perfectly. This top is versatile enough to go either with workout clothes, or with jeans and a cardigan for a casual look. They wash and dry nicely (don't lose their shape). I have these in lots of different colors and love them all."
4.0,"It is okay. I wear it at home. Same as in picture. Reasonable. Will be better a little lower in price, and have more print designs. It is good to wear around family, practical and descent.  Unlike some other makers that overly exposed front and back that you cannot wear around people. Not practical. Not all woman are models and excited to show their body around grown up adults."
4.0,But doesn't seem like it will hold up to repeated laundering. Good for the price.
4.0,This is a really pretty T-shirt dress. I normally wear an extra large but this is on the small side. The fabric is  a thick  sick polyester  and Doesn't have a lot of stretch. I have Large bust and normally wear an extra large but this is too small.
4.0,I like the watch band but there were no instructions on how to modify the band for a good fit and the tools to do it were missing.  Since I ordered two different bands I had a little tool in the other package but the tool was so flimsy I hurt myself trying to do it and it ultimately broke.  I am left with &#34;now what&#34;?
4.0,Good hat for the price!  Came wrinkled so it took a little steaming to unwrinkle. Wear w/a sundress or when walking my dogs in the summer!
4.0,"Fit moment was great. Bright colors couldn’t have been a better picture for it on the site.<br /><br />It is warm tho. At least for my son, he looks adorable but can’t use it much  I live in Florida so it’s always hot but had to see him in it"
4.0,Very inexpensive & worth what we paid for a special project.
4.0,"This silver bracelet is beautiful. The moonstone is of high quality and each of the three stones shows a bright blue fire. I am giving this bracelet four stars because although it is beautiful, it is way too big! I am not a small person and I was afraid this bracelet would fall off! Fortunately the silver is pliable and i am able to bend the metal to fit around my wrist. Just wish it didn't have so much extra room from the start."
4.0,Great.. Works well
4.0,"It's cute, smells good, and my daughter seems to really like it."
4.0,Very nice item.  Fits my Pandora bracelet perfectly.
4.0,Hoodie is exactly as pictured. I got a large based on reviews and while it’s slightly larger than I was wanting a medium would be too tight so I kept the large. For reference I’m 5’7” and 130lbs. I wish it was slightly thicker material though.  I would probably buy a lot more colors if the price was about $5 cheaper.
4.0,A bit heavier than i thought
4.0,"I'm 5'1 and have a small chest. I ordered the extra small. It comes to about halfway down my calves, and the chest is definitely a bit tight. I have broad shoulders so it is a bit tight in that area as well. The waist was a little tight but I kind of wanted it that way. Overall I really love this dress despite it being a little tight in some areas. it isn't so long that I look silly in it which is a struggle for someone my height."
4.0,These are good quality shoes. My toddler probably had about 4 pairs. I wish they came in bigger sizes.
4.0,Its a little too baggy in front
4.0,Love the way it looks and the fabric was very comfortable...
4.0,"I really like this- it's a great beach top, flattering, and nicely lined so one doesn't need a bra under.  I will say that were I better endowed on top (small B cup), I'd be really spilling out.  As it was, there was just a little side boob, not enough to feel awkward about."
4.0,Was a lit it tarnished and chain not that great.
4.0,love everything except the price and no way to attach protection tool without aftermarket accessory
4.0,"With the exception of the way this rides in the rear (and doesn't stop, mind you -- see the product photos for an idea of what I mean), my partner says this is very comfortable to wear. She says it feels like she's going to fall out of it, but that's not realistically going to happen. The product photos are actually a great representation of most qualities you can expect in the wear of the suit.<br /><br />What it hides is the fact that tummy control here is strictly with regard to the lower tummy. If your stomach remains level up to your chest, then it will likely poke out a bit through the hole under the chest. Let me assure you though, no one's going to care, if they even notice. Odds are people will be so wowed by how much more stunning this makes the feminine figure seem (than it already is on its own) that your upper tummy won't register in their eyes.<br /><br />The chest is padded. The crotch is solidly built (no unwanted slips or shaping here). There aren't any uncomfortable or unsightly tags to deal with. It's a high quality item. And a list price right around $25 is completely fair for what this delivers. I could see some wearers putting shorts over the bottom, but those would only be necessary if you didn't want people seeing most of your rear.<br /><br />And the way this rides in the rear is the only concerning issue you're apt to encounter. Still, it rides in a way that's not unflattering (hopefully that made the amount of sense I mean for it to, as I'm someone who doesn't enjoy the look of thongs, etc.). If you aren't worried about a decent amount of wedgie, then I'd gladly recommend this to just about anyone. Even if you think you won't look good in it, you're probably wrong."
4.0,They look cute. It when I was taking one off it broke
4.0,"Purchased several other rings from Enso and they are great, the quality, durability and the fit and this one from the Harry Potter collection is all of that, except the printed design on it, it's off not centered so you can't see the full design and beauty of the Harry Potter Hufflepuff house but other than that it's of great quality and will always recommend Enso..."
4.0,The material is thinner than expected.
4.0,I am 38D postpartum and Medium was snug to zip but fine. However the armholes gaped a little where I wasn't careful you could see my bra under my armpits. Overall a nice dress except for that.
4.0,"Super sexy and well made. Will fit any body type but probably best if you are well endowed in the breast area:) That is the only reason I gave four stars instead of five - I am a bit small in that region so the top fits A BIT loose, but obviously not their fault. Also comes with a really cute matching thong. Thinking of getting another one!"
4.0,I'm 160lbs 5ft 8in. Great buy.
4.0,Got a lot compliments with the dress I wore it with.
4.0,"This shirt is perfect for yoga.  It's long enough to give you a little bum coverage but not so long that it gets in the way.  Flowy without being huge.  Comes in a bunch of colors.  Cotton that dries easily.  And most important for me, I have a rather big chest and always get into embarrassing cleavage situations-- this is a tank that is high cut enough on the neckline that I can move freely and never have to adjust myself.  I am planning on buying a few more.  The only thing keeping this from a 5 star is the expensive shipping.  I ordered 2 shirts and was charged to separate 6 dollar shipping fees."
4.0,These are nice gloves for potting plants and other light weight work. I dont feel that these could stand up to heavy weight work. I love that you can type on a phone with these gloves. They work great on yardwork. Very comfortable to wear. I usually have hard time finding gloves to fit me cause I have short fingers but the Medium fits my hand like a glove should. Looking up the price these are very economical. Recommend
4.0,Fits great!  Great price!
4.0,Beautiful bracelet but it broke on day 2.
4.0,"Once I get these on, I love the way they feel.  The elastic is really tight and supports my feet.  They are a bit of a challenge to get on; sort of like support hose - lol.  Nice bright colors."
4.0,Fit great - good price and comfortable!  Would recommend!
4.0,Love the colors.. thought it connected  but other than that it's thick and warm
4.0,This jacket it fitted in the waist. It would have been nice for a bit more room in the body. It’s a great weight for a jacket though.
4.0,"Ritchie 18mm Mesh Stainless watchband is nice, finish is very good. Difficult to adjust length to very small wrist. Looks good once set."
4.0,Nice and color full
4.0,It fit but I HATE ordring that size. I'm a 10. WTH
4.0,It was in a padded envelope and in a box with the top popped open. Both pairs were in 1 pouch. No cleaning cloths. No more protective case.<br />It got here a day early. I liked the price for 2 instead of what it is for 1.
4.0,I like them very much and will purchase atleast two more pairs.  They are very lightweight!
4.0,"Quality is great!  However the size does seem to run a tad small.  Nothing major since it is adjustable, but just letting others know it runs a little small."
4.0,"These are pretty long style dangle earrings.  While cute I had some issues.  The black and gold pair had one feather attachment that wasn’t attached.  Was a pretty simple fix , the link wasn’t pinched close enough and I was able to correct that in less then a minutes.  Not a big deal but the other pair with the multicolored beads didn’t match each other at all.  I don’t know if that was a design or a flaw but for me it was annoying.  Both pairs have open back hooks.  I had no irritation, lobe swelling, or tarnish marks when wearing."
4.0,"it is very stylist, i would recommend to wear for vacation near ocean or on the beach"
4.0,"Well made, great price. The clasp works but it's a little annoying."
4.0,"This dress is just like pictured. It has no lining though and it is see through. I can't give a five star rating because of that. With a slip, it will be wearable. It also was delivered quickly."
4.0,Fits great! Love the back. The bra pads are easily seen though... recommend a thicker shirt to cover
4.0,A little too long. Buy the size smaller than you would normally wear. But it's soft and super comfortable.
4.0,"The color and fit were as expected. I am 5'2"", so this dress just barely touches the floor. At 150lbs the medium well-fitting at the top, and just a little loose where it needs to be on the bottom."
4.0,"I consider myself average sized with a 30 waist but this petticoat was on the tight side for me.  It fit but was a bit too tight for comfort.  However it fit my 7 year old daughter perfectly!  In fact she used it today under her Easter dress which she wanted to have more poof.  It was beautifully constructed and she was comfortable wearing it.  I love that it has the versitility to be worn with a short or long dress too.  It really makes a huge difference in dresses.  My daughter will also wear it under her first communion dress next month.  Her dress though beautiful could use more poof and this petticoat makes such a dramatic difference.  I would recommend it to smaller ladies or children over the age of 5 who need a little more volume in their dress up loves or for a formal affair<br /><br />Disclaimer:  I received this product at a discount in exhange for my honest, unbiased review."
4.0,Very Soft and herbs smell nice when heated.. Heat boots one at a time to prevent burning and overheating.. 30 second intervals until warm..
4.0,Really like these!  Perfect color to support our local marching band.. but the only thing is they DO scratch easily. Wish there was a better coating on them.
4.0,decent hat for the under $10
4.0,These shorts are very comfortable and breathable when working out. I would buy again.
4.0,"I like the band, but it came with a face plate to match the band that was entirely to big. So pretty much I got a band only. I sure I ordered the right size. My other bands were fine."
4.0,Fits great. Little longer than expected
4.0,"Pleasantly surprised, the quality is better than I expected. Good stitching, no frays. I only wish there's more color options and not to have the word &#34;Passport&#34; embossed in front. Other than that, really great product, would definitely recommend."
4.0,Very big! This was sent to me in error. I thought it was a smaller hand bag.
4.0,This is a little snug.  I'll be happy when I lose a little weight.
4.0,Fits like a baggy medium or a tight large.
4.0,Ordered both floral prints. BO3 has brown (like a milk chocolate color) leaves not the purplish color is appears in the photos. The material is soft and the style is flattering.
4.0,"I don't think it's actually real leather, but it still looks cool"
4.0,Perfect with a suit which is exactly what I wanted.  Tired of arranging blouse lapels over suit jacket.
4.0,"Good quality but unfortunately to large,  will exchange"
4.0,"I’ve had this ring for 6 months now and it’s still in excellent condition. I bought this ring with another enso ring to stack up with one another. I wear them 24/7 through doing everything; showering, dishes, gym, sports, lotion. Wet, cold, dry, etc. this ring has great durability. My only reason it’s not 5 star is bc I ordered my size according the the “size chart” and the ring is slightly big. Not a big deal but it’s not accurate."
4.0,"I got the earring quickly and on time and tried it on after cleaning it off and I must say I love it!! When I ordered it my only two concerns were if the back post would be flimsy and break off easily like others have reported, and if the size of the earring would be too big fit my ear, I have small ears. Thankfully neither of those things were the case for me and I plan to wear them tonight for a test run.<br />***Hint*** there is a screw like piece on the top of the earring that can be adjusted so it's not too tight on your ear."
4.0,Runs about 2 sizes small but nice cotton fabric. Originally bought a size bigger for my husband and still a size too small so I wear em to bed.
4.0,"Fits great, looks nice."
4.0,The fit is great! Can't wait to see results!
4.0,I like these because I can breathe better with this thinner material but feel protected because of the filter. It feels a bit loose but maybe will be better after washing. For some reason it kind of turns on my neck when I have it pulled down and then the filter would slide out some so I pinned the filter in so it wouldn't move. But all and all I like them better than the regular masks and the other thin gaiter style I have.
4.0,I was really worried about the colour because I don't like orange but the yellow was pale. I decided to try something new and was pleasantly surprised. If only there were more colours.
4.0,My ten year old likes these cleats. I like them because I can always spot him across the field as they are so bright. They are good for evening time. Comfort maybe could be improved but overall are good cleats.
4.0,"They both fit nicely and aren't &#34;cheap&#34; feeling.  I like that they are adjustable too.  If I had a complaint, it would be that I wish you could choose what colors you want."
4.0,Overall good quality. Fit well-- true to size. I was a little let down by the colors. I feel like they're duller in person than in the photos. Overall happy with the purchase.
4.0,"This product is way too small in an XL.  I debated L or XL and went with the size up recommendation.  Wow - it is way too small. I can get into it, but I certainly can't wear it alone.  I can wear it under a swimsuit or summer dress to give me the long sleeve sun protection.  I am very fair.  Yes, the sleeves are LONG.  That is really good.  I will keep the product.  But definitely, order 1-2 sizes LARGER.  I only went one.  I'm kinda borderline in many tops I choose L but just in case, often XL."
4.0,Beautiful....very pale.....love it.
4.0,Description is accurate. Nice glasses.
4.0,It runs smaller but is a stretchy fabric so order one or two sizes larger. Image looked great on shirt.
4.0,"Ordered 2 different colored pairs of socks. I guess I expected a different pattern on each pair. Then I compared them to a pair I had bought weeks earlier, and all 3 are the same knit pattern. Quality workmanship, beautiful colors."
4.0,"This was kind of too big but also kind of too small. It's cute but the top wasn't long enough to cover all of my (large) top. The bottoms are super cute but they kind of fit like a diaper...I think this would be much cutier on someone with an hour glass shape. Aside from the fit on me, this was a very well made suit. It looked just like the picture."
4.0,good price and makes one notice it being worn.
4.0,worth the $$$ ....
4.0,The sleeves are long enough and very comfortable.
4.0,"Works well, fits comfortably, looks good. I little flimsy compared to previous similar products I've used, but would still buy again. Just took a little more manipulation to get it to retake its form after placing in my ears."
4.0,good material... however I would like for them to be longer
4.0,Long but still fit good.
4.0,"These are very cute!  They are also easy to put in - they are a bit heavy, but not to a point of being uncomfortable.  Would buy again."
4.0,Would have given these a 5 star except they are not for 18-20 mm snaps.  It says so on the packaging but they are for the smaller snaps.  I plan to keep them and possibly buy some smaller snaps in the future.
4.0,"This is really cute...love that the straps adjust.  it is very inexpensive but good for the summer to just throw on...good with little booties or sandles.<br />Packs up like nothing.  I bought two (one in another color combo) and will be taking them to Florida.<br />One other thing?  it is not too short, and not too long.  I am 5'5&#34; and it is loose enough that I feel very comfortable with my belly.  Also it is NOT shear at all."
4.0,Really like these boots!! Super cute and pretty comfortable for what they are.
4.0,"It is a pretty hair piece and a nice elegant size. It is the size the picture shows. I have worn it a few times and it stayed put very well. One of the little metal comb teeth is a little bent, thus 4 stars, but other than that, I'm happy with my purchase."
4.0,Besutiful dress. It is a little longer than expected but still looks great on my 4 year old. The material is a little thinner than expected.
4.0,"Good fit, but one thumb was a different shade of black than the rest, which is really noticeable. The black used for most of the fabric appeared more dark indigo but the left thumb was like a brown-black."
4.0,"Definitely runs small. I have small hands and the medium was a little bit tough to get on. Once on, they were comfortable and soft. I shoveled my driveway and my hands were cold, however just walking about they were warm, so just keep out of the snow!"
4.0,The product is a good product that's why I've given it a four-star rating. However in the ad it showed behind the Amber Jewel was open could see the Amber from both sides of the pendant. However when I received it it had a closed back. Not able to see through the piece of Amber. Just wanted to put that out there for everybody in case you were thinking about buying one
4.0,Lovely pattern. Comfortable cotton fabric. The arm holes are a little small. The short cap sleeves are very small and almost like a sleeveless dress.
4.0,"These are some pretty nice, clear and very light readers however am just a little disappointed that the right handle was very loose upon delivery and broke after the 2nd time I tried wearing.... I rather had paid a little more and still had the option to return if broken in such short period of time they seem used,  probably why their was a  no return rule which I didn't notice! Other then that flaw I would  surely buy them  again I liked them a lot."
4.0,I like that it kind of looks like a regular short set.
4.0,Was not as warm as was stated.
4.0,"Nice summer dress. I'm a 36D and the medium fits fine. It flares at the hip, so you don't have to worry about that measurement. I'm 5'4&#34; and it comes to mid-thigh on me, so just be aware if you're on the taller side. The material is very thin and breezy."
4.0,"Very cute shirt, looks just as it does in the photo, but it sits small. I normally wear a size large (5’8”, 169 lbs), and I wish I would have gotten an XL."
4.0,Nice necklace. Hopefully itvdoes on t tarnish.n
4.0,"very good pants just lacks pockets , when working men like to have lots of pockets ,especially truck drivers"
4.0,"Ran really small, especially after washing"
4.0,se pueden utilizar en cualquier occasion tardaron en llegar pero vale la pena
4.0,"This is a nice, flowy top, but unfortunately was too large. I fell in between a large and an XL, and I erred on the side of caution and ordered the XL. I should have ordered the large - the XL is too big through the chest and upper torso, making the top look too baggy and unflattering.I will either need to take it in on the sides, or just use it as a nightgown. The material is really soft and comfortable, and the top appears to be well-made. I will wear it one way or the other."
4.0,"Flexible/Slight elastic, in case it gets caught. Comfortable to wear. Only downside was it was not double sided print, So you have to be aware what side is up when putting it on. (Hey!, I got the image to be seen.....what can I say)"
4.0,Mahogany Obsidian is beautiful but pendant cord is very short and clasp difficult to open and close
4.0,beautiful and very nice run a bit small though
4.0,I wear it all the time. It's very comfortable!
4.0,These actually ran small so I gave them to my sister because they're very nicely constructed she is a size 8 and I am a size 10.
4.0,Well made small in arm put area
4.0,"Very nice, had to knock off one star because the bells do tend to fall off."
4.0,Beautiful dress fits big thou
4.0,"I really like it but I wish it was tighter. They run large. I bought the first one and had to return it because it was just too big on me and then I bought a second and although it was way better, I wish it was tighter. I can easily use it on the last clasp line so yeah. Still a good trainer."
4.0,The necklaces were a little long in delivery BUT since they are destined to be gifts this was not a problem.  One did arrive with a broken chain.  All in all I was very pleased.  Thank you.
4.0,"While these goggles were very cute and did not fog up at all, they did not work for me while wearing with a helmet for skiing. They sit too low on your nose and make it very hard to breathe.  I WANTED them to work, but after spending a day or 2 constantly taking them on and off or trying to hold them up off my nose so I could breathe, I broke down and purchased a $50 pair of Smith goggles at the resort. It was well worth being able to breathe! These may work on a much larger person or possibly without a helmet, but definitely not for an averaged sized woman.  Well they did not fit me right, they did seem to perform very well !"
4.0,"I like it. It's comfy. But it's hard to keep wrinkle free. The quality is a little below average. It's plain to see it was put together as fast as possible. That said, I still like it."
4.0,Super comfy. The grey area is cheap material but oddly works with the black cotton. Fits well. Got lots of compliments on the pants. No complaints here.
4.0,"Very cute,but did run a bit large. I have long hair and put it in a ponytail that I pushed up under the wig. It was still a bit loose,but did stay in place during the duration of the party."
4.0,This look ridiculous but they work. Only issue is the hook that keeps the strap on the leg keeps digging into a hole that has developed on the strap. Other than that no problems. This takes your look to the next level and prevents that mushroom effect where your shirt puffs up at the belt line. It also helps with reducing the appearance of wrinkles. I don't see too many people using these so you pretty much have the edge by being one of the few to know this little secret.
4.0,It is a good boot. It fits perfectly. I have concerned with color. It will be really great if I get a different color boot or mix of 2-3 colors boot as this is for a kid after all. I was looking for light weight boots. It is little heavier than my expectation.
4.0,Very nice quality scarf! I wear it everyday to protect my hair. I love it
4.0,Nice colour. Love the labels. The measuring lines.. very convenient
4.0,Fabric is thin but not see through.  Cups are free floating in the top and since I am small chested i need to secure them somehow.  Very cute pattern
4.0,Nice vintage look. Works fine for basic use.
4.0,Just wish they made a one-inch size buckle.
4.0,"Decent enough chain. Well constructed. Unfortunately, I cannot wear it because my girlfriend told me it caused her to fall out of love with me."
4.0,Fit as expected. I love the dress
4.0,Comfortable and forgiving fit
4.0,"Great dress for the price, fits nice."
4.0,"These have been my go-to shirts for about a year and they've held up pretty well. I've put them through the paces of working out, hiking, and just out and about. They are quite comfortable and not too thin (but not by much). I purchased a small and it fits my body type perfectly."
4.0,"Bought it for college. The bag has a lot of space for books, if your putting a laptop like MacBook Air I would tell you get a sleeve, so it fits snug.<br />Great Bag"
4.0,love it but prefer the black ones (which I ordered previously)
4.0,It is true to image and the colour is a gorgeous royal blue. Be careful when moving since the split may increase.
4.0,Great way to organize your belongings for travel!!
4.0,"I ordered 2 suits. The green and pink arrived without the top padding or a hygiene sticker with staining in the crotch. It was more like an XL. I purchased a large - 5’2”, 32DD, 126 ish - but would’ve been good with a medium.  The other was clean. The bottoms were small but not bad because of the adjustable sides.  The top was more like an XL, especially in comparison to the bottoms. I ordered a large in both. See size comparison photos.<br /><br />Edit: I upgraded this to 4 stars. I returned both of these suits and reordered the green leaf one in a medium. The bottom was still too big and the bottoms were both too big and too small at the same time. They are full and came up high on my back but were snug so it looked weird on me. It came with pads and a hygiene sticker this time. It really was nice quality, but didn't fit me well so I ultimately returned it, but would still recommend it."
4.0,"Great for traveling.  Traveled abroad with this and it was very convenient for holding cards, passport, cash and business cards."
4.0,"Very nice shoe....I thought since the Diadora soccer cleats fit my son that the running shoe would too.  Not, the cleats are roomy and wide but the standard running shoe was not wide enough.  My son loved the color of this shoe though."
4.0,Great looking  glasses
4.0,Works great on my tired feet
4.0,It was bigger than I hoped but it really is quite attractive and looks expensive. I am very pleased with every aspect of service and value
4.0,I like it but it is way too big.  But I am going to give it as a gift.  Great quality cloth.
4.0,"I've rolled in this gi for a couple of months now and it's held up to grappling and washing (I don't put it in the dryer). It fits well and lets me move. For the price, it's good but it doesn't feel as durable as the level up in Elite's line of gis. The pants I think will eventually rip, but they're holding up so far.<br /><br />To be honest, I think it's worth stepping up a few dollars to Elite's other gi because those have a sturdier construction than does this one. But if you're just starting out, this might be a good beginner gi."
4.0,I was very pleased with my order. Came on time and the color selection wasn't bad at all. No one will be able to tell the difference between my real Lily and Laura bracelets and these.
4.0,"I like the material...soft and nice weight; perfect for summertime.  Negatives:  I'm missing pockets and a loop for hanging on a hook...these would be nice and easy additions.  For the cost, I'd say it's a reasonable value, but if it had pockets and a loop it would be 5 stars ;)"
4.0,How can you go wrong.... it's a button... with Zombies!  I am having a Zombie birthday party and I thought these would be best for the adults.  The pictures are great (for the adults) and will be a great giveaway.
4.0,"excellent product, prompt delivery"
4.0,"Not the best sun glasses out there, but not the worst. The lenses are very cool, and so are the glasses, but the lenses on mine keep popping out once in a while, but that's only when I'm going something like running, climbing, or something active. If you want something that is not very expensive and that looks cool these are the glasses for you."
4.0,"I ordered these socks in a size medium and they fit somewhat snug.  I typically wear an 8-8.5 in Nike and a 7.5 Adidas for reference.  I have relatively small calves and I actually found these to be pretty tight and I actually lowered them down instead of pulling up on them.  Otherwise I think they are great.  I haven't been on an exceptionally long hiking trip with these yet but have worn them to take my dog on a 4-5 mile walk and they were very nice to have on.  They are thick but provide good support and I do find them moisture wicking.  The colors are very nice, somewhat tie dye with pink, green, and blue but a good amount of each color."
4.0,As previously reviewed. Smaller than expected.
4.0,Love the dress but is a little thing<br /> Other than that it's very nice.
4.0,"Pretty dress, but not fitted shape enough."
4.0,Cute but not the size I expected.
4.0,"Very comfortable. The color is a lot brighter than the picture, closer to a hot pink color."
4.0,"but it has stretched some and i still wear it, looks great"
4.0,Very cute. Thicker then d thought it would be. Glows great.
4.0,It worked longer than the others.
4.0,It's very warm and stylish -
4.0,This is a soft t-shirt material with feminine lace at the bottom. It has some shape and fits a little loose. It's very long and looks great with leggings. I kind of wish the fabric was a little dressier to set off the lace but it's very comfortable and very cute.
4.0,"The purse overall is really nice, plenty of pockets and space and the size is perfect.  The only complaint I have is that it doesn't stay on your shoulder very well.  Color is really cute, I am happy with this purchase overall."
4.0,"Fit very well. Not the sewn on patches (name, numbers, team logo) I was expecting. Team name was ironed on, not stitched. Not what I was expecting from the description,  but I'm keeping it."
4.0,"I have adjusted my rating of this hat after a long day in full sun. The weave is too open to actually keep the sun off my face. I got color despite wearing the hat all day. This brings it from being a versatile sun hat, to being just a fashion accessory. This can no longer be my go-to hat. My original review (unchanged) is below.<br />————————————————————<br />I was disappointed when I first took this hat out of the package. Crumbled up, without a head inside to give it shape, it really looked pretty bad. Then I tried it on. What a difference! It’s actually a REALLY CUTE hat! And it’s incredibly versatile! It has a flexible wire around the brim. This lent to it looking bad right out of the package, but it means that you can fold it into any shape you want - and it stays that way! I had skin cancer on my nose, and need to wear sunscreen plus a wide-brimmed hat at all times while outdoors. Therefore I have amassed a bit of a collection of hats, and this is the only one that I can fold up however I like without having to constantly readjust it. This will be my go-to hat.<br /><br />This hat is also a loose weave - lots of air holes woven throughout, so it shouldn’t get too hot. The fabric feels soft and nice quality. The brown color is more of a rust (the last two photos show the color best. I included two different photos of me wearing it so you can see how much you can bend it into whatever shape you like. I guess if I had to say anything at all negative about it, it’s that the brim is not as wide as I’d like it. Depending on the sun angle, it may not protect my entire face. Other than that, I love it."
4.0,Love the fit wish it was more pink than peach thou . Just figuring out what color to wear with it.
4.0,"The outfit is super cute. Very Fashionable. My daughter 2 years and 10 months old, she wears 3t-4t. Some 4t runs a little big onher. I ordered 5t thinking she will be able to wear it for a little longer, but the shirt is very tight on her and the skirt is a bit short. I should've order 6t."
4.0,"I was skeptical buying this but  it is a lot stronger and fits plenty in it  ,  the outside pockets are deep and useful during my commute to work and I can fit my 15.5 laptop in it. The only problem I have with this bag it the  shape isn’t too sturdy, not a big problem and that white canvas part , up top is not easy to clean so if you purchase it , use  some kind of  protective spray  so it won’t get filthy because after  a little while it looks a little dirty and you have to keep cleaning it."
4.0,Cool watch however it is heavy.
4.0,No bad for the price.  A little hard to see out so don't plan on going anywhere.  I used it for a video we were shooting and it looks great on camera.
4.0,"I am very happy with this key chain! It looks nice and good quality. It could be a little bigger just because my jeep key is huge and bigger than the keychain, but overall I am very pleased with my purchase."
4.0,"My expected delivery was at the earliest Oct 30th, but I received ahead of schedule, today, Oct 17th. I keep reading the reviews... the item is described as a t-shirt, which is what it is. It is a long sleeve t-shirt. It is NOT heavy material. I ordered the purple/white and it is very true to color. I also read the difference between American & Chinese sizes--I typically wear a small (5'3&#34; 114lbs), so I ordered a LARGE and it fits perfectly! It is loose-fitting on top, but that is also described, so I think the t-shirt is exactly as it is marketed. So my advice is simply to know the product you are buying & read the information correctly. I am satisfied with my purchase!"
4.0,REALLY! Wanted a Black Pocket Watch!
4.0,Photo quality isn't that great but overall it's a decent product and makes a nice gift
4.0,The Necklace is beautiful though the chain broke after trying it on but it was an easy fix.
4.0,"Very cool leggings but they do run a little small. They also do that weird stretch thing when you bend over the print stretches and looks white- if you know what I'm saying? I think I should have went a size up from my normal size. I LOVE the button pockets though. Not very breathable but still comfortable.<br /><br />Reference: 5'7"" 155lbs 30"" waist 37"" hips"
4.0,I bought these to cut down on the glare of night driving. I have used them and it helps. They<br />are made well and are large enough to fit over regular glasses if you need them to .
4.0,Ring is very pretty but runs a little small. Not enough to return it but just a little hard to get off.
4.0,Much prettier in person. My granddaughter loves it
4.0,"I love this so much. Its a little tight over the hips while putting it on, but it does have a zipper and since it sits above the hips it ends up being comfortable. The only thing I do not like it the straps are not adjustable and the left one keeps sliding off. I will probably just pin or sew them. The material is thick and soft and it seems very good quality. It comes to just above my knees like 2 inches but it covers my butt with no issue.<br /><br />I am 5'6, 200 lbs, and normally wear 16 pants and XL shirt. I ordered XXlarge and its perfect."
4.0,Fit my dad.  Not too heavy. Good color selection.  Fit a little loose since dad is so thin.
4.0,"Work great just don’t wear watch in lake , watch came off band did not hold"
4.0,"very high quality, would definitely recommend. i wish they had different size posters for different league sizes. Only down side was we had to fill out a handful of stickers at the end of the draft, however I think that was to be expected"
4.0,"Very light weight, see very well.👍🏼"
4.0,great product and comfortable but only needed one size up rather than two for the right support from the pouch.
4.0,"I thought this was a bit of a heavier jacket with the look of it but it is just a bit thicker than a long sleeve Tee. It is very comfortable and well made. I usually buy my jackets in a XXL b\c I wear a 48 suit jacket, this seems to be a bit big on me.....No big deal!!"
4.0,Works as advertised although it is a little tight on the head.
4.0,"A little smaller than expected, bought as a gift"
4.0,"I love the style of this dress, super trendy and cute! It is very flattering on. It has elastic built into the waist that cinches in showing off your curves.  From the waist down there is a tulip hem that can show as little or as much leg as you want. The dress runs large, so on me there wasn't too much leg exposure. The style isnt supposed to be fitted, it's meant to have a that loose, effortlessly chic look. However I ordered a small and it was a little too big in the bust and waist. I'd recommend sizing down. I am 118lbs 5'5"" measurements 34-25-38. The dress is very comfortable on and even has hidden pockets! I was also pleasantly surprised at the quality The material is thin good for spring or summer wear, and it has a lining underneath. No issues with it being see through. It has an invisible back zipper.<br /><br />The dress comes with a matching tie belt made of fabric but to me it just sort of blends in with the dress. I will use another belt with a contrasting color to show off my waist more. I loved the way the leopard dress looked with a red belt and red pumps... I'm really channeling my inner Cruella de Vil !!!"
4.0,"Well made, looks good, Width is fine, but size 14 length is a bit long, so much so that your heal doesn't catch, even if you tie the laces tighter.  There is not much else in large sizes out there, so this is a good one for us big feet!"
4.0,I like this one also very noticeable
4.0,"I love these shoes. They are super comfortable, and roll nicely forward when you walk, thanks to the upward toe. The shoes are amazingly well constructed, and looks like they will keep out snow and rain (so far, rain has been no match for these). But, just above my ankles, the top of the shoe is a bit uncomfortable due to the fact that I have to tighten the shoe strings to get it to fit right. The resulting issue is that top of the tongue gets smushed together, and the gussets on either side of the shoe (keeping the snow/rain from getting in the shoe on the sides of the tongue) press against my feet when walking. The gussets aren't super flexible, so it's not a great feeling. However, the fit is so perfect, I really don't want to return these. I'm going to give the Forsake Scrunch a try and see which one I get used to the most.<br />If you want to try these, go down a size (an 8 feels perfect, and I'm usually an 8.5 in Lands End Women hiking boots).<br />And if anyone's wondering, for a women's hiking boot, these boots aren't too bulky, heavy or wide. I don't hike (lol), but wear them in/out of the office and on weekends like weather-proof tennis shoes. They are slim and nice enough to wear with jeans, even on a petite frame."
4.0,I love these earrings. I’ve gotten lots of compliments on them.
4.0,I bought this necklace as a gift for a dear friend. He loved it!! I'm very pleased with the company's customer care and with the ultimate result: happiness and satisfaction for a perfect gift!
4.0,I wanted to like these but they fit more like leggings and I was looking for more of a jogger style. I would suggest sizing up and then they would probably work unless the waist would be too big.  Haven't tried it.  I just ended up returning. The material is light and feels nice.  The quality for the price point is great.
4.0,"Very distinct earrings. I love these! I just want to point out that there are little areas on the earrings that aren't black, maybe due to bad packing or something."
4.0,It is a bit overpriced for the quality of the tank.  It fits alright and will be nice to wear this summer.  The fabric is lightweight the color is good.
4.0,"This was my first clothing purchase on Amazon. I ordered a size up because of some of the reviews, which was not necessary. It's a little large, so I will pair a belt with it. The white is not as white as it looks in the picture and one of the buttonholes was not cut open, easy fix with a seam ripper. I had hoped it would be a lighter weight. It's a heavy polyester which is more suitable for cooler weather. It says 90% polyester and 10% spandex on the tag. I do still think the dress is quite cute. I told my husband it's the perfect dress to wear in Helen, Ga. when it's cooler...lol."
4.0,It's a bit bigger than I would like (would fit a bustier lady more) but the style is gorgeous and I still wore this without too many issues :) Beautiful design and looked great!
4.0,Thinnest wallet that I have ever had and I love it....feels like a premium product and seems to be holding up well despite the contents and how slim the wallet is
4.0,"The color was nice and vibrant,  thevthicknesd was just right,  wish I bought a larger size because it clings to much for my taste, which made me wear leggins with it."
4.0,Fit well and like the grips on the bottom.One pink sock developed a hole on the side of the big toe within 2 hours. Others have been through the wash dozens of times with no problems. Just discovered these are great socks for hiking. The grips keep my feet from sliding forward in my hiking boots on steep descents. No more bruised toenails!
4.0,This was adorable but it was too small so I had to return it.
4.0,tighter and thicker than the all black ones good
4.0,"Photos show dress above the knee, not sure how tall the model is. I purchased this dress in 3 colors, black, the Aztec looking print, and this pink with dots. The black one was above the knees, the other two are mid calf on me. Not sure why the huge difference, I ordered the same size on all three. I can’t tell if it’s going to be one or the other, so order at your own risk and hopefully it’ll work out???"
4.0,"The costume part was good.  The mask was too small and had tiny eye holes, which didn't work for my son who wears glasses.  We painted his face instead."
4.0,Arrived on time and functions well.
4.0,[[VIDEOID:47e50334af0e368dde80f4629324125b]] It's a little tight Perfect for summer very cute the straps on the back have a lot of  Stretch to them I ordered a small I think a medium would fit a little better
4.0,Great colors. I think I ordered the 2nd to smallest size and they are perfect. Glad I purchased these.  They do not irritate my ears at all.
4.0,The top was a little short
4.0,"This was a very amazing watch for the affordable price I got it at, speaks highly of these watch makers. The detail that was put into the watch gave this work meaning into creating a great product. Very impressive, will continue to keep an eye on up coming product from these watch makers."
4.0,it's a good dress the only issue I had is that the dress was cut so uneven at the bottom. One side was way longer than the other. luckily I know a really good seamstress that was able to fix it. I do recommend it if you have time and extra money in getting the dress fixed.
4.0,It comes too far down on my forehead
4.0,"Considering the low price, this is a very nice cloak. A good addition for a Halloween costume."
4.0,Pretty but a little brighter than I was expecting and very light metal as they’ve already bent a little.
4.0,BEST MATCH FOR PENDANT.  SMALL AND COULD USE MORE BLING.  STILL NICE.
4.0,they seem to be very well made
4.0,Runs on the slightly smaller size. Quality and Comfortable feel.
4.0,"Chamois is too wide, somewhat bulky"
4.0,The shirt is cute however it’s very see through. Wore a white bra under it and you could see my bra and my skin perfectly. Wearing a tank top under it looks funny because you can see the tank top so you can tell you are wearing 2 shirts. If you like it see through then great! If not just prepare to find something to wear under it that looks right. I like there shirt though so I will keep it and find something to put under it that makes it look good. True to size as well! Size medium.
4.0,For 19 bucks you cant beat it with a stick. I bought 5 more units to give as gifts to distant in laws. Paul sends
4.0,"All the cool kids will get this, but I'm holding out for the Druish one.<br /><br />It will take some new scientific discovery to make the mathematical formula for ""Schwartz"".<br /><br />Until then, I'll be hanging with Dot Matrix."
4.0,It is very<br />Nice.
4.0,"I bought two of these. They are very well made, tightly woven, but they are very heavy. Also, with the way they were crammed into a small envelope, trying to get the folds out of them is frustrating. I'm hoping with daily wear, they will relax and fall naturally. These have a very wide brim which is fantastic, as I have cancer on my face and the oncologist says I must cover my face/head/neck for the rest of my life. Due to the heavy weave and the price, I will most likely order more of these in other colors."
4.0,Expected the green to go completely around
4.0,Cute shirt and great price but it felt starchy and not very soft (even after a few washes). It's a pretty standard shirt with Mickey on it. I recommend it if you're okay with it not being the softest thing in your closet. It was cute enough and made my Disney trip extra special! It went perfect with a pair of maroon pants I had.
4.0,Very pretty but I thought it was a necklace.
4.0,sleeves too tight
4.0,Super warm well made parka. Good fit and finish. Highly recommended.
4.0,"I've gotten used to getting my hair out of the hops. It happens once in a while, usually in the shower but it's not really difficult to slide it free. It got caught in the mesh part of my pillow last night though and that wasn't fun!<br /><br />They are definitely 925 sterling, no reactions or irritation. So that's a huge plus"
4.0,Other than being larger than expected it's a very cute outfit.
4.0,"Decent socks for the price, but the elastic at the top has started to break on a few pairs after just a few washes."
4.0,"Unfortunately, my unit came without instructions. I charged the power block and plugged in the scarf - nothing happened. You tube had a generic review, and I was able to determine one of the power (USB) outlets was bad, the other worked fine. The scarf has three power (heat) levels red - hottest, blue next down, then white - lowest. Push button and hold until the red comes on, then by just pushing button the levels will change. Push and hold to turn off.<br /><br />Once all that was figured out, the scarf worked as advertised. It felt great on my neck and the power lasted for about 40 minutes (at high). A larger power block would last longer."
4.0,"I like the shirt and I'll keep it, but I was expecting more from an XL. I normally fit larges just fine. I guess its not gonna fit like the model for us curvy girls."
4.0,"The style is great, the color was accurate, and it’s the perfect size for taking into the stadium, which has bag size restrictions.  It fits my phone (iPhone 8 plus) and some credit cards/cash, maybe a lip balm, though there isn’t much room for anything else.  I took off one star because I’m not sure how long it’s going to last ... it seems a bit flimsy."
4.0,"I'm impressed with the quality of this item.  It was delivered fast in a cute little draw string bag and the earrings themselves are nice.  They are sturdy and have good quality backs, which seem to be hypoallergenic. My daughter and I have very sensitive skin and neither of us are bothered by these studs.  I like them and bought the silver studs from this company as well."
4.0,"This belt is better than I thought it would be, the buckle is substantial and the actual leather and build quality is really good.<br /><br />The only negative is taking it off, wanted to go to the bathroom and took me 5 minutes to figure it out, it gets tight and you would need to pull it while press the release button.<br /><br />I would try it on/off a few times to be comfortable with the buckle before it is a crisis!"
4.0,Nothing  wrong
4.0,This is a great pajama/costume. The fit is great. Keep in mind that these style of pajamas have a crutch area that hangs much lower than normal. This is not a flaw but part of the design. Very cute. I wish the buttons were closer together but I think they are spaced out to make it easier to get out of if needed. I was satisfied with the quality of the material. Colors were just as pictured. Fit was good. I expected this to fit larger and it did so keep that in mind when ordering. As for sizing the biggest difference in going up a size will be in height and length. It is made to be a baggy fit. Perfect for my under the sea event! 💛
4.0,Got an XL because this brand runs small usually. But XL was tighter than I like and this style is not offered in a XXL.
4.0,"When I first looked at these, I found myself a bit overwhelmed by all of the colors available, but that was mainly because I liked the look of them so much! In person, they're just as pretty, and a 3 pack for this price is a great deal! They make for lovely gifts!<br /><br />I ended up going with the caramel, which is very much like an old gold - deep, rich color that floats between a gold and a bronze tone. The lace edging is beautiful, and subtle. These will need a wash before wearing - they have a bit of a chemical smell to them right out of the bag, but if you're gifting them and don't want to wash them, you could always toss a lavender sachet into the bag for a few days before removing them from the bag and wrapping them for gifting.<br /><br />The fabric of the scarf is soft, sheer, and matte. There's just enough to these scarves to attractively cover your shoulders, or make for a generous sized head wrap. Well worth the price!"
4.0,"This sweater is cute and very soft, I was pleasantly surprised."
4.0,Great watch for a great price. Numbers are easy to read and the band is made of nice leather. Lightweight and comfortable to wear. I’m happy with my purchase and would recommend to others.
4.0,I must have gotten the XS case because even with changing up how they go in the case this thing is not going to shut. Otherwise the glasses themselves are nice and reflective and anyone talking to you will see themselves in their reflection. They are heavy duty and will not break on their first outing. Worth the price but bring your own case!
4.0,Little smaller than expected.
4.0,works but should have ordered smaller size
4.0,"I love the colors of this shirt, the material, and overall style. However if you prefer a slightly looser fit, I recommend sizing up 1. Not a bad shirt overall, just was hoping for something a little flowy."
4.0,Charin and charms are thin metal and bend easily; have had to repair the jump ring between the chain and charm twice.
4.0,"These are so comfy! Not too thick for fleece leggings, but I liked that. And I love the high-waisted! They are just a little see-through, but I expect that of most leggings. I knocked off one star only because they have a funny smell to them, even after washing!"
4.0,Keeping in mind the low cost of entry this really is a nice watch. Lots of details on the face and keeps time well so far. I'd buy another one if I found a different color combo.
4.0,"These are great masks for the gym (obviously can't beat no mask at all). They sit well on the face and because they reach under the chin, they don't tend to ride up the face when you open your mouth. My only real complaint is that the strap across the back is stitched to a specific point on the ear loops instead of being able to move up or down on the ear loop. Because of this, sometimes when you tighten the rear strap, it pulls down on the ear loop which takes pressure off the back of the ear but adds pressure to the top of your ear. That would be my main recommendation for the company, allow the rear strap to move vertically."
4.0,"This shirt came as described and fit nicely as a true large. It is definitely cut for a woman which is nice instead of a big oversized tshirt. The material is soft. I'm deducting one star because I got a lot of pilling where my purse sits against the shirt. I washed this shirt about twice weekly during the holiday season, and it held up nicely otherwise. I hung to dry so not sure if it shrinks or has any issues in the dryer."
4.0,"Very cute socks. They are thin, but that is the kind of socks they are. I really like them"
4.0,The Goggles are a perfect addition for the Steam Punk Top Hat.
4.0,It is pretty but has a straight line of very light color down the middle of the brass. Wish it was more uniform.
4.0,"The chain is different from the one in the image- a bit short too, but it's still great. The whole necklace is pretty heavy. The front cover of the Death Note doesn't stay open by itself, you have hold it open or the hinges will keep it shut. There weren't any scratches on the front of it, but there were some scratches along the inside of the note where the hinges close the front cover with the rest of it. Shipping was good; it arrived in about two weeks."
4.0,"This sweater looks nice on, but it definitely runs small and after a few washes (line dry) it pills up.  I used my sweater shaver on it and it looks nice again."
4.0,These open toe compression socks fit well and are comfortable.  I will definitely be ordering more when needed.
4.0,"The bands are very easy to install with the quick connect pins.  The black band looks good, but the gray band is not the same color on both sides, so the part that folds over does not match and looks weird.  The pink band is OK if you like the color pink."
4.0,too sheer; needs sweater or some other mild cover up
4.0,"They feel great but they tight.  The next size up, which my sister had, was too big 😕"
4.0,Cute heart but a little cheaply made!  The arrow catches on everything and bends!
4.0,"Hot, muggy nights are probably the worst aspects of summer here so comfortable and cool sleepwear is a must.  When I saw the Selene floral striped nightgown, I decided to give it a try.<br /><br />This full slip has adjustable straps and lace applique in the front. The fabric is  95% polyester and 5% spandex.  It feels soft, like a thin t-shirt.  For medium size, the slip measures 17” from armpit to armpit and 27” from armpit to the hem.  I’m a little over 5 feet, and the slip reaches just above my knees.<br /><br />It is made in China.  It’s machine wash cold.  The Selene nightgown/slip is comfy and provides adequate coverage for hot summer nights.  It's great for lounging too.  And if you’re into the lingerie look for daytime, this slip is pretty enough to be worn as a casual dress.  As a dress, I’d probably paired it up with a denim jacket or vest."
4.0,If you don’t really carry too many cards or cash then it’s good for you other than that it not good for you
4.0,Decent. Others can still see your face/eyes though!
4.0,My daughter loves them! Taking one star because the fit is a tad small and they are kind of sheer. Other thsn that great item!
4.0,"Pretty bracelets, quality seems to be good this far."
4.0,Good compression and no complaints.
4.0,"Pleasantly surprised! Most the time all the little dials and timers are fake ....show only. This watch for the price is hard to beat! If the arms would ""glow"" at night... would be perfact! In any case , very happy!"
4.0,"I love Fitflops, have worn them for years, have at least 14 pairs--all I wear in the summer! This year new designs are sometimes cut differently and the band across the instep does not come up as high as most other designs. I can still wear them comfortably but prefer those with the higher instep!  I love the supportive platform on all their shoes, I have their boots, clogs and plenty of sandals."
4.0,"Dress is very cute but the underarms are too big and it is way to short. I cannot comfortably sit down. I'm 5'7, so I guess on someone shorter it would be appropriate"
4.0,Nice enough belt but it was larger than expected and the end piece is almost too large to fit through the belt loop on my shorts and trousers.
4.0,"I ordered for me, but I personally didn’t like the ear straps being so thick. Otherwise no issues"
4.0,This is a really cut dress and I love it but it kind of runs a bit small when I orderthe dress they for go to send the belt with t so I inquired about how to get the belt without returning the dress just to get the belt and they sent the belt in the mall a few days later. Due to this mishap I was unable to were the dress for the function I had purchased it for.
4.0,Looks great but kind of cheap but in the end you are paying 4$.
4.0,Cute shirt with bright colors. My daughter really loved it now that she is a big sister. I ordered one size up because children grow fast but even with that the shirt was snug. You will want to get a size up maybe even two.
4.0,I love the design. It’s roomy enough for me. Wish I could close the top.
4.0,The only problem I had with the dress was the buttons came off. Easy fix. The dress itself is very nice!
4.0,"They came on time, fit fine. I have worn them several times."
4.0,Great color! Great fit.. I'm a 32A & it's perfect! Giant fake Boobs can't really give a real review since they stay up/ don't move without a bra.. This is super comfy!
4.0,This was worth the money you pay. I wish I had remembered to see if it had pockets; it doesn't in case you were wondering.
4.0,"These polarized sunglasses were fine except for one thing. The lenses pop out too easily, in fact one of the three pair I received arrived with one lense out of its frame. I fixed the problem by putting the lenses back in and then placed a small spot of glue in two places on the inside of the glasses."
4.0,"The bead comes out a bit easier than it ought to.  I'm pretty happy with these, but I'm worried that I'll lose the bead sooner or later."
4.0,"Fits as expected. Decent quality. Hard to match with black, but goes well with jeans."
4.0,So far so good.  Everything fits ok.  Don't know how to check the RFID feature.
4.0,"The fit is somewhat large - even after taking that into consideration upon ordering. The fabric seems a bit cheap -- obviously a faux wool, but its all good, because that is what I was expecting and the price reflects that. Great for the price, and comfy. Will wear it."
4.0,Good variety. Seem a little cheap.
4.0,Love Romika Mokasso and just wish they had continued to make the leather version. But these are the same style and fit so I &#34;make do.&#34; I'm just glad I can still get these via Amazon as they don't seem to be sold at US vendors. Delivery is quick and I've now ordered 3 pairs (for me and family members) from this seller with good results.
4.0,Fits nice. Has the wax to help melt and shape to your mouth for a more comfortable fit
4.0,"I really like these tag-free briefs.  I've been using another brand of tag-free underwear for around 3 years now, and they have held up very nicely, but are also much more expensive than these Aukivon's.  If these Aukivon's can hold up for at least a couple years, then I might switch to them exclusively.  I'm a little concerned with longevity on these, as there are already frays in the underwear before I even got to wear them.  Only time will tell how great these really are."
4.0,It’s a nice dress but should’ve warned people that is was see through. Don’t wear any colored wear. It will show.
4.0,"These socks are not your grandmas compression socks. The design on each pair is fun, which is great for when your wearing them with shorts. The socks are very comfortable and provide a good amount of compression to help with leg fatigue and assist with varicose veins too. I work about twelve hours a day on my feet so these help keep the swelling in my legs down, the first time I wore them I immediately noticed a difference on how my legs felt/looked at the end of the day, I had considerably less tiredness and my legs were not as restless once I sat down/slept for the evening. I enjoy these socks they are easy on/off following the usually compression sock method. The price for four pairs is a great value I have paid more than this for a single compression sleeve!! So if you like fun socks, and less pain in your legs I would recommend these."
4.0,"Seriously...why is there an angled zip at the neckline which doesn't fully open so it just sits there looking weird? Regardless of that, this is a comfy top. But because of the wonky neckline, I don't know if people would want to wear this!"
4.0,I'm overall happy with this costume. the white zipper at the crotch is really weird and now i have to work on a solution to it. I am still unsure of whether or not the costume is see through and what kind of undergarments I need to wear.
4.0,They look great but one of them broke after just a few days of wearing. The others have held up.
4.0,"Love this dress, it’s thick enough to not be sheer but still be cool, that being said it’s way bigger then it should be, I’m 5’4” and 130 lb and I got my usual medium and I’m pretty sure I could have fit into an XS, if your into the baggie style though it’s great, just add a belt"
4.0,"It fits well width wise but lengthwise it's a little long, but that's a common problem for me, since I'm only 5'1&#34; and my torso is short. This causes it to fold on my back which creates somewhat of a lump...so I just use it for working out or running; it's pretty comfortable for that."
4.0,It's a beautiful dress but it runs big I order size small but and got takin and it's long I'm 5ft 1 and it reach at mid calf
4.0,"Color, style as pictured. Soft cotton. Will be good for cooler weather."
4.0,Good quality. ordered  the yellow the lining is more fluorescent rather than that bright yellow colour in the pic but that's minor. a few loose threads but nothing a little snipping cant fix. I'm 5' and weigh 110lbs i ordered the small fit as expected.
4.0,Great product with many applications & uses.
4.0,"Very cute bracelet, much like the Stella and Dot version. Seemed a little tight on my wrist but I do have big wrists."
4.0,"Got these for my daughter's valentine's. Some of the graphics were off, but they worked well enough for 1st graders."
4.0,These were great! The only thing I would do differently is purchase bigger metal loops for some of the charms. Some of the charms would not fit on the bracelets. The kids loved making them. There were enough that fit the bracelets so no one was disappointed but I have a bunch that the kids would have chosen if they could have used them. I'll find uses for the rest so I have no problem giving them 4 stars.
4.0,"Very nice shoes, good quality, just a bit bigger than expected."
4.0,"The bottom will come up to show my bra or the top will come down, so I have to use bra tape to hold it in place, but very cute. Great for the Neon themed dance I’m going to"
4.0,"These are really cute and have the grips on the bottom (every toddler sock should have these)! But the top of the sock seems too tight. My little one is pretty slim, just turned 1, and they leave red marks on his legs. I fold them down to his ankle which seems to help."
4.0,Dress is nice but it’s a slimmer fit than expected. The skirt part is as tight as the rest of the dress. I would recommend buying a size up.
4.0,"This fits my daughter nicely. We ordered the smallest size, and she has a little room to grow."
4.0,I really like the blouse a lot.  The fabric feels very delicate so I am hand-washing.  Overall the drape is beautiful and it feels great.
4.0,The shirt is as pictured but the details on the sleeve are more than anticipated. The design is much more intricate than expected
4.0,Fits comfortable I have only worn them for 2 days. I can do a review later.  I hope they are good and hold up well long term.
4.0,I think the fabric was lovely. It just collected hair quickly (and i have 4 animals). I also wanted wider wider bottoms. These were a little bit narrow for me.  These fit as expected and were NOT thin or sheer.  Cut to fit
4.0,Good fit and very cute
4.0,"These are a pretty good fit.  The legs are a little looser than I expected.  But otherwise, they are fine."
4.0,"If you get this, buy another chain. The one that it came with was discolored and brown. I bought this as a gift and would have been embarrassed to give it with the chain it came with."
4.0,"Works as expected. I wear these under my uniform, they are cool, comfortable, and keep my vest from chaffing."
4.0,"Havent used yet, seem a little small but others said they were a good size so taking their word on it. This 3 pack is so cute though! Didn't see this pattern at any of the baby stores and like it a lot better than their other patterns. Buy it!"
4.0,"This belt is so cute with so many outfits. The fit is great since I am very petite and it is always so hard to find belts to fit my 25&#34; waist. It is a little cheaply made, the bow is just glued on, so you have to be carefully not to pull on it when takin kit off. I think it would be an easy fix if it does come off, just use a glue gun to attach again. Overall; very cute, grate fit, but not the best made product."
4.0,The headband worked great and I had plenty of compliments for wearing something so cute.
4.0,"I luv these tank tops very pretty and light ,keep you cool and add a bling to your outfit but could cost a little less."
4.0,Wore to my nephew's wedding
4.0,To make you feel better.
4.0,Comfortable and makes you feel energetic to wear.
4.0,"Too short fort tall boots, but its a nice sock"
4.0,to small but cute
4.0,"I like the belt, quality seems nice. I'm a size 42 so I ordered the size 42 belt. Makes sense, however the size 42 belt would probably fit someone who has a size 38 waist. Disappointing. Not to mention this belt wasn't available through Prime, so no free return, not worth the cost or hassel to exchange, so its going on craigslist."
4.0,"The gems are a little smaller that expected, but they do the job, I seem to lose the tops a lot not sure how they come unscrewed all the time so getting this many is nice for the price"
4.0,"I ordered these retainers to wear in my upper ears because I'm only allowed to have 3 piercings per ear at work. All my piercings are long healed, but tend to get irritated if I take jewelry in and out each day or go a few days without jewelry and then push jewelry back through. I thought these would be a good way to keep something in them without being noticeable. it was a good idea, but they're too long for my needs. They would be great for tragus piercings, or even nostril, lip, or labret. I like that they push together, so you're not losing clear o-rings like with other retainers."
4.0,Good Product-Fast shipping
4.0,In the picture it looks like a bracelet but really it's a necklace. I wanted a bracelet. I kept it anyway and it's pretty .
4.0,"I love LoveKitty, they have great service.  I was a little disappointed to find these ranged in sizes much smaller than what I typically buy from LoveKitty.  These sizes would be perfect for nails (some are the size of a pin head!) but not so great for decoden projects.  There was none of the larger, 1cm diameter pearls."
4.0,My boyfriend is 230lbs and 6'4&#34;. Sweater fits well and has some room. The print is pinkish against the red isn't of true white - overall good buy.
4.0,"Gotta bow 🎀 on my panties, cuz my ass is a present."
4.0,"I trusted the other reviews that said the solid colors fit true to size and ordered a medium.  I believe they run a bit small.  While they do fit they are very snug.<br />I ordered the 90 degrees flex capri in a print and all of the reviews said order up a size.  I always take a Medium, but in the print style I<br />ordered a large and they are PERFECT.  The fabric of the print is a bit smoother and the shaping and fit are very comfortable.<br />Wish I had ordered the black in Large as well."
4.0,Nice quality but somewhat roomy.
4.0,Nice but screw has fallen out of lenses and now unable to wear these sunglasses.
4.0,This watch stopped working within a couple months of purchase. Not worth the money.
4.0,Very good color nice material little small
4.0,"I made the mistake of not paying attention to the dimensions when I ordered. So what was supposed to be on my wrist is on my 12 year old's instead. Out of nostalgia, I ordered this for myself because my first wrist watch was this very watch. Too bad! Next time I'll pay attention to the size. The watch is awesome no doubt about that."
4.0,"These are nicely made, good quality socks. It is a little hard to put on and it does indeed provide compression to my leg. There is no bad smells from the fabric. The color is a little bit too bright for my taste. These socks are solid and I assume they will last for a while."
4.0,Awesome looking shoe.  Fit a bit small due to the strap covering the laces but as expected.
4.0,Very cute but can't give 5 star because it is much smaller than item pictured.
4.0,Bulkier than expected.  Hard to use on touch screen because they are bulky.  Not any warmer than any other glove I had.
4.0,"Cute and adorable yes yes, just be careful because they do pop off the stud if they are not handled with care"
4.0,I love these slippers. Very pretty and what a bargain! The only advice I would give to anyone ordering them is to maybe order a size larger. They are a little snug. I couldn't be happier with them and will order more as gifts!
4.0,It's a very nice dress but most if not all my dresses are this size this really runs small
4.0,"Excellent shirt to workout in, this is my 4th one"
4.0,"Heart from the necklace and earrings are all the same size. Much bigger than I expected, in between a half dollar and a quarter I would say."
4.0,"I really needed this rashguard swimsuit top!  I need to protect my arms from sun when we go out on our boat.  I won't be able to wear this one, though.  I don't wear my swimsuits super tight.  This is super tight!  The sleeves are really long, if you have long arms.  The colors are very pretty.  There's nice detail white stitching on the pieces stitched together.  The fabric is a little of the heavy side.  I've seen rashguards a lot lighter weight than this. This may make you hot.  I believe the way the pattern of pieces are sewn together it should be flattering. But, unfortunately I can't wear this.  I usually wear a large in swimsuits and tops.  I know swimsuits are notorious for being different fitting between brands.  I guess rashguards are, too."
4.0,Great ring I purchased This ring for my Daughter It had great Silver and Ruby color I know she will like it.
4.0,"Socks are very thin, like a dress sock."
4.0,The  Shirt  was beautiful But too small
4.0,Bracelet is too big for my 3 year old. Very cute though
4.0,Super cute! It might not last long because the stitching is poor quality but for that price even if it lasts one summer it’s wirth it. I have large breasts and they actually fit in this suit!
4.0,"Exceptionally pretty!  The long sleeves are nice,  I like the neckline, and the fabric is as smooth and velvety as a puppy's ears.  The sizing is a bit tricky:<br />I bought a small for my mom who  size 12 but it was snug for a robe. I am size 8, and it fits me perfectly. So consider ordering a size up."
4.0,It was a great product for price and great for a costume. Will look perfect for Halloween.
4.0,"Same style band I would buy 50 years ago.  But geezz, twice the price for black, same dang band ! Just bought the cheaper silver and coated with my lanudry marker black.  My work watch.  Casio plastic bands break so fast , barely a years worth of use.  This style usually last almost 2 years when young.  A pain to take out band to adjust. Instructions like # 8 font, cannot read them anymore."
4.0,"The size of these earrings are a little bigger than I would normally wear, but they have a really cool 80s retro vibe.  They seem really sturdy, the posts don’t bend easily and the metal has a nice finish to it. I think it’s a good value for the money."
4.0,"Nice but large around my legs. Sold to my friend and found the brand in my local store.( hate to say, but at much cheaper price) I wear a small in them not a med. Love them"
4.0,"Soft, comfy. Perfect for beach, over swim suit"
4.0,"The neckline looked different from what other buyers have posted on here. A bit disappointed about that since I was hoping it would look like the one posted by other buyers. Dress runs very very big. I'm usually a size 6-8 and bought a L bc of what others were referencing but it was way too big. I would repurchase bc it is a cute dress. Not sure if I should get a small or medium now bc of how big the dress was. For reference, I'm 5'3&quot; and 130 lbs. The dress was long and down to my feet. The color is a true red. Refer to pictures"
4.0,This necklace looked very nice with every outfit I matched it with. I wear with my casual wear.
4.0,"The glasses I purchased were brown to tan. They’re pretty ginormous. I felt like they’d work for Mardi Gras, but they wouldn’t work for me at the beach or driving around. Cute, but not for me."
4.0,"Color is beautiful. Length is really nice. For a larger person this is a good cover up. Good for the beach, or as a top. I understand the arm hole complaint. It is a little tight. I'm sure I can fix it. For the price you can't go wrong."
4.0,Sexy and fits perfectly! The only thing I will say is I seem to make noise everytime I walk because the fabric was rubbing against my jacket but it is still worth every penny!
4.0,I got the 3XL and it fit well. I'm 5ft and 245lbs. 42H bra. But I had to hem it almost 10 inches!!! But I like it enough to buy it again.
4.0,The only reason I did not give it a full 5 stars is because they are not as thick as I expected them too be. They are squishy. I really enjoy that because my ears and nose and lips are sensitive to a lot of other materials used in piercings I have wore this in my upper ear for about 24hr with zero swelling. I recommend this product to anyone with sensitive ears.
4.0,Fit and quality were great
4.0,"I can really tell that I have these on. They fit my smallish glasses well, even though the clips set the top of the clip ons kind of far from my lens. This may be why I'm having trouble getting used to them. They work as advertised, though, and really make light coming from the Fire tablet amber. I think I'll stick with them."
4.0,Fits well...accessorize to up the glam!
4.0,"I really like this set even though they don't &#34;match&#34;.  The colors are pretty true to color of the picture.  The one thing that disappoints me is that the bracelet is so big, I can't even wear it and according to the description, this should have fit my small wrist perfectly."
4.0,The material is rough. I didn't know it had purple in it.  I thought it was gtey white and pink. I would not have gotten it if I knew it had purple in it.  But I am going to keep it.  Because returning it is more work than it's worth
4.0,I sent the swimsuit back because it is not deep purple it's more than light grape color it's a little snug I will recommend going up a size bigger
4.0,"I give it four stars because of whatever it is made of is impossible to clean.  Any of the other colors are fine and you will LOVE LOVE LOVE it.  Im disappointed in the white, however, because it stays dirty looking.  Even after a few wears I cannot even bleach it clean.  Looks nasty.  Stay away from white... other colors GREAT!"
4.0,"This ring is super cute. It's a little thin and the edge on one side is not super smooth but it's still worth it. The color is a good rose gold; not super pink and fake looking. I pair it with my real 18k rose gold jewelry (have bracelets and earrings) and it matches very well. No one was able to tell the difference. I think because my other jewelry are quite expensive and because this didn't look cheap, everyone assumed it was also real and expensive. It was also very comfortable to wear. I want one that is double the width though. That's my main complaint. Otherwise, I'm a happy customer."
4.0,"I ordered one size up because I fall between two sizes. The Large fit well. Very flattering. Two complaints: the zipper was faulty (on the dress I received) and will need to be greased or replaced; and the undershirt part is a bit loose and doesn't lay flat. I intend to bring it to a tailor to resolve the undershirt issue. Overall, a solid dress. I plan to wear it to wedding."
4.0,Nice fit. Really happy.
4.0,Pleased with this
4.0,"I usually fit Medium in clothes. Read the reviews and decided to get small just because I’m 5’0”. Weigh about 120 lbs. I’m glad I got the small. Im pretty short and the dress passed my knee. It fits great, not too tight nor too loose. Great dress. Great quality. Fast delivery. Need I say more. Highly recommended."
4.0,"I like these sweatpants, the fit is a teeny bit bigger than I expected, and I do wish they touched my feet as opposed to coming EXACTLY at my ankle. Otherwise, the material is great and they’re extremely comfortable, and a great price!"
4.0,"LOVE the pattern but the back just doesn't cut it for me - so had to return.  Otherwise, a great suit at a good price."
4.0,Love these bags and use them all the time. Slightly smaller than I expected but great all the same!
4.0,I love this dress. The company making it had created a standard size when I didn't respond in time with my measurements. When I finally sent my measurements they made a new dress. I tried it on and it fit perfect. I am getting it shortened for my own personal taste. The lining on the lace is a bit itchy so I will add fabric to make it softer. Great timing though. I got this for my wedding and love it.
4.0,"This is a nice quality fabric, but the style is cut extremely wide, didn’t work for me."
4.0,Great hoodie and fits true to size. Ordered an XL and it fits perfect. The hoodie is not to tight nor to big and is very soft. The material is great and is well made.
4.0,These run narrow and a bit bigger than expected.  Wonderfully warm but I wouldn't recommend wearing outside.
4.0,The color is pretty and the length and overall fit are as expected.  The only reason i subtracted one star is because the material is SO SUPER THIN.  Definitely not what i expected.  It shows every single tiny imperfection in the most unflattering way.  I honestly don't know if i'll be able to wear this for the intended occasion.
4.0,"Much lighter weight than many brands of wool Kilt hose. These are acrylic/ nylon blend that feels good to the hand. Calf length is good and the look is pleasant. The cream color is more white than cream. All in all, they're a good value for everyday use, but you'll probably want a higher quality for full dress. The best news about these is that they are legit Made in Great Britain, not China or Pakistan. That in itself is enough reason to buy this brand."
4.0,"Looks larger in photo. Cheap, trendy almost plastic looking. My girlfriend liked it at a distance on my wrist. Soo for the price.... It's a great after summer throw away."
4.0,"Cute dress, looks like the picture and shipped quickly! Material is nice and thick, but don't expect it to hold you in.<br />Dress was slightly large in the waist, but is easy enough to take in. All in all, this is a great dress for under $30."
4.0,Better than expected.  Has hidden zipper in the scarf section.  DO NOT PUT THIS IN THE DRYER.  Must air dry.  If you do expect to lose some of the &#34;fluff&#34;  My daughter absolutely loves it.
4.0,Somewhat small but cute
4.0,Buy a size up if you are  a little bit more curvy. It was a cute dress just didn't fit my daughter.
4.0,I received coin purse today and I will enjoy however it's little more brown in color than I wanted but I do like the multiple colors. I can carry it will each different Giani Bernini purse
4.0,Runs really big! My daughter was drowning in the 120 (sizing is a guessing game) and she’s a 3-4T. Seemed like really good quality though and was super cute. Ended up returning it since it was bought for family pictures. But it was cute!
4.0,"I use them for night driving and it seems the glasses (for my eyes) ""may not"" be cutting out enough glare. I also have an issue with today's headlights. The headlights used today are so INSANELY BRIGHT ""sometimes I actually believe I'm on my way to heaven!"" Obviously I need a darker lens to block more light. I'm giving a 4 score and 7 years ago - oh, wait wrong story - sorry. Anyway, I'm sure most of the issue is with my eyes not the glasses."
4.0,My daughter likes it so I bought her another set.
4.0,Looks great and fits large man. Fake muscles look awesome. But a little too hot because of not breathing material and one glove had a hole in it but it was easy to fix.
4.0,"Well, I uploaded this review with the gloves on so it works well on touch screen!!! Everything about them seems nice, but I put four stars because they do seem a bit more flimsy than I expected.. not as tough. But we will see I suppose. Otherwise they fit as expected and seem to be warm (though I have not worn them out in the cold yet)"
4.0,Good backpack for short trip
4.0,Cute style and looks darling on my daughter.  She's pretty tall (5'10&#34;) . I was hoping the top was a little longer - but it was still very cute on.
4.0,"This is a rather shapeless dress. For the ladies like me that have the mommy hips it can make you bigger than you actually are when you first throw it on. However it's comfy material, I love the pockets and just about everything about it. With a safety pin I pulled part of the fabric to the side to give it a nice hourglass shape and it's perfect to wear to work and after hours drinks."
4.0,"Mine has a minor defect, which is no big deal, considering the extremely low price. Colors are beautiful and the overall effect is great. I also put it on a cord because I did not like the chain."
4.0,"I’m always scared to order these things online because I don’t trust that they’ll fit, but this fit fine. The material is nicer than those cheap Halloween costumes you get at department stores. It still feel a little cheap, but looks nice and is a great deal for the price. I’m wearing the to a costume party (as Rowena Ravenclaw), but I probably wouldn’t wear it to a renaissance festival."
4.0,"Seems to work as well as the more expensive ones that I had that the coating failed on.  For $15, if the coating fails, I'll just get another pair.  Looks fine on a woman."
4.0,I love it so cute I took everyone's advice and sized up. To me sleeves were a little to long for me I ended up pinning them  up. That made them a more appropriate length for me. I could just see myself trying to ear dragging my slrevenue through everything yuck! But honestly it does have a giving elastic band but not spandex material. Super cute though. I purchased a size Large and normally wear size Medium 8/10 in tops and am a 34D.
4.0,Super cute the neck/ head hole is just a little too small
4.0,Present for my granddaughter who is into Kpop. She loves it.
4.0,Size fits as expected and Nice Texture
4.0,"The only issue I had with it was they were not in order, but overall a good product for the money. It certainly made my friend's birthday better"
4.0,"Be sure to order early, as my set came without the nose.  Amazon did give me a refund and I was able to purchase a nose separately in time for the event.  The vest and bowtie are quite nice."
4.0,"It's a solid mask. Tight around the nose, and if your face is wider it has no flex to it. Fits my face just fine though!"
4.0,"This was for a gift for a Star Wars buff, the person loved it!"
4.0,Cute but kind of heavy
4.0,This ring is absoluelty beautiful! But it was a bit small. I ordered a size 7 but it fits like a 6.
4.0,"It came in a timely manner, was intact, and was as described.  I haven't given it to my wife yet but I think she will like it very much."
4.0,"bought it as gifts fitted nicely, hope it last long."
4.0,Very nice shirt. Classic style.
4.0,They are nice but I did not realize that they could not be adjusted to kid size. So I had to pin them to make them smaller.
4.0,Cute shirt. Breathable ...great shade of orange. Fits to size
4.0,It's cute or whatever but the ring is just a tad bit too chunky to be believable. There was also some sort of weird metal scratching on one side of my ring which was weird but not too noticeable.
4.0,somewhat stiff.
4.0,its good.
4.0,I'm average height and it ended up being slightly shorter than I'd hoped. I'm a bit larger in the chest and this is also a little tight. I can make it work though.
4.0,"works well. fits passport, credit cards and some cash.  attractive."
4.0,I like the product the only problem is that instead of receiving a pack of 3 I only received 2🙄. Can someone help me? I do not want to return the item. Thank you
4.0,"It arrived super fast, came in a nice gift bag ( ready to gift someone)<br />It’s exactly as pictured, I like that the bracelet itself its spiral , so it’s not getting everywhere like normal bracelets, at the same time you can’t tell is just one piece just by looking at it!<br /><br />My only concern is how delicate this piece is, but it’s worth because it really is just like pictured!"
4.0,&#34;pearls&#34; were more oval than round
4.0,"I bought this ski jacket for my daughter. She likes it. It fits well. We went up a size so her winter sweaters fit comfortably underneath. We got the blue. It’s not terribly stylish, but it does the job.<br /><br />I think this is a good ski jacket. I can confidently recommend it."
4.0,"Very comfortable, great protection from glare.  The plastic feels a bit cheap versus other Oakley's I have - you sort of think; &#34;how much did I pay for this piece of plastic?&#34;  I also wear the Jarbra Sport bluetooth headphones which are thick at the top of the ear, so are these glasses.  So when jogging, the combination doesnt really work well as headphones are not seated in place in the ear properly ... when am I going to get it right!  Would I get them again, so far yes."
4.0,"I have the HomeDepot version of this Kamado ceramic grill; I got the 22"" and it came with a thin stainless top chimney cap, but even though they put screwholes in both the top of the grill and on the stainless chimney cap, they didn't include the mounting hardware (Screws/nuts).  This item measured EXACTLY what my stainless cap measured in diameter, so when it arrived today, all I had to do was adjust the 3 mounting ""legs"" to give it a tighter fit and it's PERFECT.  This item also came with mounting screws/nuts, but the holes in this chimney cap don't align with my grill, so I'll live with it, not a problem.  I also do like the darker look of the cap vs the stainless, which I could tell was going to quickly discolor as I use my grill.  I'd give it a full 5-stars if they could make the mounting holes line up for the compatibility"
4.0,The material was thinner than I imagined i thought it would be a plush velour but it was a thin replica. Not plush at all.
4.0,Fit somewhat small with socks on. Bare feet it fits ok
4.0,"Good shirt, washed fine. I'm not crazy about the cut, the shoulders seem to square cut, with no form BUT it could be that my son is a little small for his age and needs to grow in to it. Cute design."
4.0,"My son loves them. Waist fits good, but the legs are too long. They drag on the floor. We haven't washed them yet, hopefully they'll shrink."
4.0,Cute design. Good size (I like my brooches larger).
4.0,"My little girl loved the boots so much that she wore them around the house for hours after the package was unwrapped, and I asked her anything about the shoes: Good! But later I found a problem. There were signs of skin abrasion on her ankle where the upper of the shoe touched. The work was too rough."
4.0,Sorry it does not have a light for night time.  Band fails before watch battery needs to be replaced.
4.0,The shawl is exactly as stated very nicely made and embroidered package very well beautiful item this is something you're interested in don't hesitate to purchase
4.0,nice. Fairly heavy.
4.0,Super cute and not babyish. They fit my 5 year old and 8 year old
4.0,"This is a very pretty watch, but is a little big for my wrist."
4.0,My backside is a bit on the larger side. I'm very slim and my waist is unnecessarily small so the back part right above the butt isn't fitted at all.
4.0,"So-so fit. . . It depends on wat shirt & leggings I wear😢 but, it's beautiful."
4.0,This fits my galaxy tab 4 perfectly. Could bea little deeper (front to back) to fit a thicker wallet.
4.0,"Cute dress, but material feels a little cheap."
4.0,"It’s a very light jacket, fitting is nice but I wish it was thicker for more warmth."
4.0,It’s ok. It seems like sturdy material. Color not as shown.
4.0,Great little dress!!! Buy it…<br />You will get a lot of wear out of this one.<br />Lightweight material and it’s comfortable. It’s got a lining under it so you can’t see through it.
4.0,"It's slick, so you have to keep an eye on it to keep from losing it. But aside from a constant watchful eye, it's beautiful."
4.0,these are very comfortable but after a few washes the straps stretched
4.0,They arrived in a timely fashion. The earrings are super cute.
4.0,Bought it for my roommate and she love's it . She wears it all the time
4.0,This product fits well and the strap is comfortable. It also has decent detailing. I can see this product working well in a college play and plan on donating it to my University's theater club. I can't think of much else to say about this than I would have probably purchased it at full price if the shipping wasn't so high.<br /><br />I have received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review. The opinions contained are my own and I have received no instruction regarding this review.
4.0,I’m happy with these! They are a match to my pants and we’re great on a snowmobile trip!!
4.0,My daughter who plays volleyball really enjoys them. She brings them with her to games and uses them as a cover up instead of traveling in her spandex shorts. She says they are really comfortable. She is 5ft 6 and 170. I purchased her the L and they fit perfectly. They aren't loose but aren't overly tight. We have washed and dried them and thankfully they didn't shrink much.<br /><br />If you are around the same height /weight and looking for something &#34;baggy&#34; to lounge in this might not work for you.
4.0,"The part that the clasp hooks to is difficult and poorly made. However the chain itself was surprisingly strong for the price. It's a great length and the kitty is super cute. Some manufacturing flaws might happen with the charm, but it isn't too noticeable."
4.0,It's nice product quality leather.
4.0,"I think they are fine.  I bought these for my daughter in preparation for the busy Nutcracker season.  She said they've really helped her, especially in quick-changes from her ballet flat shoes to her Pointe shoes."
4.0,Solidly made of stainless steel material. It is not shiny as thought it would be. The person wearing it will surely like it.
4.0,"Wish they had option for x-small. I am 5'6 and 140 lbs, and the small is a little bit big. But I like them alot and will be wearing them often!!!!"
4.0,"I got a small and I understand this dress is supposed to billowy, but it was longer than pictured. Also, the blue wasn't as vibrant in the photos."
4.0,Lightweight and simple. Best with hair up or ears exposed.
4.0,"I wasn't sure what to expect since I knew you'd get 2 random ones, so I was hoping I'd be happy with the selection. I definitely am! Tiger's Eye is one of my favorite stones ever so this was perfect. I'd have paid just for it alone. It's obvious it's a real stone, too.<br /><br />This lost a star because of the blue one. It doesn't quite seem real. Other reviewers have complained about fake ones and it's making me think my blue one is. It's still very pretty and I'm still gonna use it.<br /><br />This was the cheapest listing I could find for bottles like these and I'm glad I took the risk- but it does seem to be just that.<br /><br />Edit: these do not hold a lot of fluid. I'm okay with that, but just be advised it's a very small internal container."
4.0,Shirt is good quality.  The decal feels sticky and not as good quality. I would be careful washing and do not dry. Otherwise nice shirt.
4.0,LOCS!!!! Great glases
4.0,"It is very comfortable and in love the pockets. Definitely a great summer dress. However the top is very low, that's why I only have it 4 stars. I am 5ft tall and am about 130. The small fit just right. Also the front of the dress is a little shorter than the back. Which is great for for me since I am short"
4.0,Very comfortable but took a while to get used to as this was my first pair that exposed the toes!
4.0,Fits wonderful and soft.
4.0,This was smaller than I anticipated and I went up a size. Not as long and flowy as expected either.
4.0,For me my feet are very important. I  have diabetes and they always hurt. I found these socks and they are just the right padding and size.
4.0,Very cute slightly smaller than expected.
4.0,It fits fine but it’s more fit for fall weather not winter weather
4.0,Good stability for cross training. Better for training on natural grass or artificial turf. Good traction. Not great for long distance running or sprinting.
4.0,Pockets are small
4.0,I cut it down for my application and it worked perfectly!
4.0,Fun tuxedo t-shirt for. It's a little bit after you wash it
4.0,"Unknown, gift."
4.0,"I love the pattern and they are buttery soft. But they will RIP if pushed too far or rubbed in the same areas for too long. I have so many pairs of leggings of this type and out of 10 only two have actually ripped in the inner thigh area due to rubbing. I will still buy them because they are sooooo comfy, but I will check before wearing them out too."
4.0,"The dress came very wrinkled and didn't look exactly like the pic, I wound up sending it back"
4.0,"This is a close-fitting and comfortable set of masks for both adults and kids with the NY logo on it. It's obviously made for sports fans but anyone who's originally from New York or loves all things New York would love it. I like how comfortable it is and it even comes with a filter, something you normally don't see with masks that are as tight as these. The smaller one is meant for a child but would also fit someone with a smaller than average face. Overall I like these and would use these on a run to the grocery store."
4.0,"I bought the Vfemage embroidered dress for my wife and she loved the dress, but it was too small. Because I expected this might happen I also purchased her two sizes larger. The 22 plus was a much better fit and she loved the blue."
4.0,"If all you need is a buff/ mask for going out, these are perfect."
4.0,"My brother loved the hat, the only issue is that it was a bit small for my brother head ://"
4.0,These are okay. Charms are cute but some of the paint isn’t even. There are some white spots on the bear and the fish charm has some red paint on it even though there isn’t red paint anywhere else on the charm. 3 stars<br /><br />Update: company has been really responsive in reaching out and addressing the issue. That’s an extra star for customer service.
4.0,"I got this dress for my daughter who loves to dress up. She is four years old and wanted a dress that touched the ground. This dress fit great and touched the ground. It poofs out nicely. I don't expect it to last years and years, but I expect it to last  for as long as she fits into it. Good quality overall. I would purchase again.  Only draw back is that the top tulle layer can rip, but my daughter also smashes it into a play basket when she is not using it."
4.0,"Absolutely adorable suit, just runs small.  I had to size up 2 sizes."
4.0,"Appears to be REAL leather. Very sturdy and appears well made. This replaces a POS that claimed to be ""100% leather"" but broke at the center hole in &lt; 4 months."
4.0,Very nice but the string is starting to break 💔 I only wore it twice
4.0,I get 2 and l make spectacular  poncho.
4.0,Love these a lot. They're comfy and feel good but the only knack I have with them is that there is so much foam around the face of it that it kind of blocks your vision a little. The Thor's I have have a much more open view feeling.
4.0,I normally wear a 8-10 medium fit fine ! Definitely gunna add a belt to it just to add a little something. Definitely worth it for the price !
4.0,"These are the best little no-show socks ever!! I have already sent the link to all of my female family members and friends. The cotton sole combined with the no-slip nylon top is the best. These never NEVER slip off of my heel no matter what kind of shoes I'm wearing. I have been buying no-show socks for years and these are by far the best. They are thin, though, so if you are wearing a shoe that is a little too roomy these won't keep the shoes from flopping off your feet.<br />I only gave them four stars because when I received these, two of the pairs were irregular -  one brown and one black - and the seam didn't capture all of the nylon material, therefore leaving a hole that I can't really repair (not enough excess material to stitch up)"
4.0,"I like them, they fit comfy and apparently they work with touch screens (I haven't used them like that just yet). I would have preferred it if they didn't come insulated, but the fact that they do AND it feels comfortable is a ""happy accident"" I'll gladly accept!"
4.0,"It is very comfy and lightweight, perfect length, as in not too long, just over the knees on me and I am 5'5&#34;.  But I would say if you are over a size 8, then it won't fit. As that is what I am and it was definitely verging on snug in the hip area."
4.0,was pretty my daughter loved it !
4.0,"This looks very nice for what you pay. It broke when I took it off the card, but was easily fixed. Came when promised. Packaged well. Looks just like the picture."
4.0,"Exactly what I wanted. Comfortable material,  great price.."
4.0,Light weight and breathable.
4.0,"I had added this to my Amazon wish list, and it's another of the items my husband bought me for Christmas.  It's a bit lighter in weight than I expected, though I did expect it to be small in size.  I wanted this as a pinky ring, and so a size 4 is perfect for my little hands and does not overwhelm them at all.  I have a problem with many rings being too large and making me look like I'm a little girl playing dress-up in my mother's jewelry.  :)<br /><br />Good quality, great price."
4.0,"It runs very small I am 5 feet and weight 178,<br />I usually buy a large but order an XL but still was to snug on me.<br />I gifted it."
4.0,The product when received had an odor.  I followed the washing instructions and that eliminated the odor.  This mask is a little tighter than I would like but I actually think it fits properly for best protection. I think it's a very good mask.  Hopefully the elastic ear straps will stretch a little as it's worn.
4.0,Very pretty charm. Necklace is cheap. Will not last long if worn daily. Pretty much what I expected for the price.
4.0,"Nice shirt, true to size.  But the cotton collar is a bit heavy for the rest of the knitted shirt and it doesn't stand up like I would like it to."
4.0,"I bought this dress for my graduation from grad school that I could also use for work. This dress works pretty nicely. The material is like a linen but the inside has a silk like lining so it doesn't feel horrid. It came super wrinkled but nothing a little wash and iron couldn't solve. The picture is right out of the package. This may not be a summer dress though because the fabric feels pretty thick. As it's winter currently, I'm not certain though. Sizing fit good, I'm a 8 or 10 and I got a Large. It is form fitting but not tight so if you want a little more of a modest fit I'd recommend going up a size."
4.0,I love this fit of this hat! I ordered the green which looked grey. That sucked but I'm still gonna order a few more in other colors!
4.0,This is nice and sturdy for a comfortable wear
4.0,Great price and great match to my dress.
4.0,These are teeny tiny.
4.0,Good quality with appropriately sized backs
4.0,"I've worn these a lot in the 6+ months that I've had them.  They're pretty, keep the shine, and very lightweight.  Got these (2 cm diameter) as a replacement for some larger (3 cm diameter) starfish earrings that broke.  I liked the larger ones better as they were thicker silver and better crafted, but couldn't find them anywhere.  These smaller ones are nice for the price."
4.0,"I guess their okay for compression socks, their snug and go up to my knees,"
4.0,"Love the vibrant color, the pockets, and comfort of this dress. It's easy to dress it up or down and has a flattering fit."
4.0,"I really like the length.  I am bigger so a bit longer helps me out.  The skirt is good quality and fits well.  I can run in it, play tennis or golf.  Wish there was a little pocket somewhere.  Also, the shorts are a little bit shorter than I prefer, but that is minor.  The one thing I did notice is that the shorts are made of a mesh material, so when I mend over, the skirt gets a little stuck to them - almost like a static cling.  Overall good product.  I would definitely buy again."
4.0,"These are not the hippest looking glasses on the planet, but their optical quality is very good and they fit over prescription glasses easily. Another play is that they surround the eyes well, so they protect nicesly against wind and car air conditioner blowing in your face. No more dried-out eyeballs!"
4.0,"Arrived exactly as described, sounds work great and the little imperfection is hardly noticable"
4.0,Runs big and not really sure on how I like the feel of it on.  Good shirt maybe working out or around the house
4.0,Creepy people want it not bad if that kind of thing doesn't bother you. I truly and pleased but I don't like attention so I don't like attention it's getting.wonderful bargain at an excellent price pleased with it.
4.0,Pretty & sturdy
4.0,"So light and comfortable, love it!"
4.0,This strap looks great on a silver or gold watch case.  This watch drys fast and it doesn't slide around on the wrist.  But the leather material on top can show creases when the strap is bent backwards.
4.0,"I really like the necklace, it’s sturdy. The only thing I dislike is the color. I ordered the gold color, it’s more yellow than l prefer, but for the price it will do . Other than the intense color, l like it."
4.0,"Fabric not quite what I was expecting. More of a spandex-y material. Also if you want a loose boxy fit like the photo, size up like crazy. All that being said, it's a super cute top"
4.0,These tend to run small fit more like size 14. No complaints from the wearer thought.  Will try boxer briefs next.
4.0,"Ended up not liking the design, but it fit my Nexus snugly, just a hair hard to get off sometimes."
4.0,"At first sight, the sweatshirt struck me as a little thin, but it is VERY warm. It generally fits as expected, but I find it constricting across the back/shoulders."
4.0,The hoodie is comfortable and the color is so pretty. The only thing I’m struggling with is the zipper. It’s horrible.
4.0,They block the sun which is what I was after. I do have some difficulty clipping them on but I manage.
4.0,Lovely shoes!!! Great fit
4.0,"This caftan is hella comfortable, but I was looking to double this as a fashion piece to wear outside of the house. I have this in a 2-color (black and brown). With that one, I was able to add a belt and rock it. I noticed this solid color item isn’t as versatile. However, it is extremely comfortable and makes me feel as though I’m giving myself a hug and able to relax. It’s very freeing and flows."
4.0,Like it very much.  Met all of my espectations.
4.0,Just as described in the details.
4.0,"this wallet is awesome-it's got great eyecatching design ,its thin,looks unique. only one con- cards tend to fall out, so u have to be attentive about it oe u'll lose your money :)"
4.0,"Very cute, didn’t expect it to be a crop top but still love it I recommend ordering a size up"
4.0,It's nice feel for the gym. I use it all the time at the gym.
4.0,I have bought three of their dresses so I know to size up! Great value for the price! Pretty fast shipping.
4.0,"I ordered an XL and it is a little tight around my stomach. However, the romper is really comfortable and soft with a really cute and flattering pattern. It looks really nice with a jean jacket and some flats/sandals. As a plus size person, I usually stay away from rompers, but I actually like how this one looks on me."
4.0,"Not the most attractive watch, but easy to read for date, days, numbers and second hand.  Perfect for the job as a teacher."
4.0,My 18month old wanted glasses like mom and dad so I ordered her these. She loves them! They are adorable. Slighly big but she will grow into them
4.0,I wish it was thicker but overall I love it.
4.0,"Nice bag holds a lot of things. Just one small thing it came and it wasn't purple it can in a dark pink, my husband will not use it!"
4.0,"The product is nice and crafted well, however the colors of the charm is not as vibrant as the illustrated picture on Amazon. Still, very nice charm."
4.0,Not the best quality. But good value for the price point.
4.0,My son love this sleeve but it was a little to big. It was suppose to be s/m but I think I was sent a large. It still wore and loved it
4.0,"These wings were exactly what we were looking for.  Unfortunately, the metal wire that keeps the wings in shape on one wing started poking out of its felt wrapper after trying it on.  We had to return it.  If the wire could be more securely put on that would be great."
4.0,Descent quality
4.0,"Decent quality for the price, but not very flatting even with the high waist... I got these in red and you could visibly see sweat marks after a 1-hour workout... These might be okay for light yoga or every day wear, but not for a sweaty workout. The material is a little thin, so the waist band digs in, in an unflattering way.  it might be better in black, but I would not buy the red again."
4.0,"Well I love converse but when I ordered them I picked out low cut navy blue, but got white high tops. But other than the mistake there great shoes"
4.0,"Good product for the price. A little flimsy. One broke while attaching it to sunglasses, but others went on easily."
4.0,"The shirt it’s so cute, I love it, has a great material. But FOR SURE it’s not 2T, it’s smaller."
4.0,women 130-135lbs 34 d  5'3 medium is too long and big . Really wish I went with a small but I looked at similar body types that got a medium here and assumed it would fit the same . Go with your usual size .Definitely would have fit small . So here's the scoop it's worth the $5-10 spent the material is comfy it is on the heavier side the inside feels warm like fleece so this is more for Cold nights . I live in the south so I can only wear this a few months of the year . The quality is good there isn't perfect straight shot stitching but it's still good enough for club or night out wear . It runs long so for petite you might have awkard shaping mine gathers at the bottom  of my crotch and by hips . It says dry clean  ( not sure if you can wash but I'm going to try ) . The green coloring is as pictured and really looks good with hazel or green eyes like myself . The downside is that you have to thread the lacing yourself which was a pain and still unsure if I did it right because it looked funny . It is a little itchy but I'm hoping the wash helps that before wearing  . Overall 4 stars I wish it  wasn't fleece itchy  feeling didn't run large and long but happy with the possibility to shrink it and wear it in the colder months .  Update :::::washed it in cold washer and dried it dryer for awhile shrunk a little which is great ! This can be washed in washer still a little long on the bottom but happy it's not too short . Still itchy :( but okay for few hours use . I added a star because customer service was amazing. I told them about the awkward size and instead of having me return and rebuy they credited me which was very kind and generous.
4.0,"This clearly is not dress length if you are older, however as a long top its great. I bought a med (size 10) based on reviews. It's fits great and not clingy. It really is a cute top for leggings, very comfortable. Possibly will buy another color. So many to choose from."
4.0,This dress was slightly bigger than I had expected but is absolutely adorable! I ordered a large and I wear a 36D and it is still a little big in the bust but definitely still wearable.
4.0,"Nice blouse, but head opening is very small. Hard to get on once you have your hair and make up done"
4.0,The only reason I couldn't give this five stars was due to the fact that the woman's medium was definitely much smaller than I expected.  My husband's size fit him perfectly.  Shipment was fast and speedy.
4.0,Leather was great
4.0,good socks. i like
4.0,"Purchased for a Halloween costume. Material is much heavier than I had anticipated, but that was a happy surprise. Some stitching was a little off but all in all it was a decent buy for the price."
4.0,"Might just be my odd shaped head, but other then the little discomfort they work as stated."
