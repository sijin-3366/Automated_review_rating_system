2.0,"The description of this outfit made it sound as if it was a three piece. It is not. It is a jumpsuit with a jacket. I love the look of the legs how they flowed, top looks great along with the jacket. The only thing is at 63 years of age. I’m not a contortionist anymore, and could not zip the zipper all the way up. being, I couldn’t see myself going around looking for someone to go to the restroom with me so I could get undressed, and re-dressed. It fit well I really liked how it looked but I can’t do a jumpsuit such a shame."
2.0,It doesn't stick well to the outer edges and gives a really weird shillouette under clothes.
2.0,Well he has work the jacket a hand full of times because the snow hasn’t even really started flying and I bought it early in sept to have it for when it did. The zipper is broke already and the return window is closed. I’m pretty pissed.
2.0,Was excited for this however the beaded area snapped very easily shortly after purchase was not a full month of usage
2.0,Nice lightweight good fitting socks but definitely not compression socks. Will not buy anymore since I want compression socks.
2.0,Advertised as a wide width and they were not
2.0,This gloves supposed to keep hands warm down to sub zero but does not meet my expectation. I used for snow blowing around 30F but my fingers are very cold and very uncomfortable. Also no gripping power on palms. I am very disappointed.
2.0,"Fits fine... bothers me when i raise my hand... and the color is not like the picture ( white floral ) it shows black, white and pink but it is navy blue with white and pink instead"
2.0,Wore and washed once and already has a hole.
2.0,"These glasses did not really make a difference driving at night, return to them"
2.0,"The material is gross, it’s like a thick plastic. It’s really thick also, not at all good for a summer jumper. It hangs weird also. I’m sending it back."
2.0,"Clothes aren't very sturdy, the seams ripped during the first wash"
2.0,They are a lot larger than I thought. I won't wear them.
2.0,They make comfortable undershirts but they're definitely not good as compression shirts. I got a size smaller and they feel like nothing more than a somewhat tight undershirt.
2.0,I am 5’9 and it came to my calf.....it is not long (maxi) I like mine sweeping the ground<br />Don’t beLieve reviews def not made for y’all girls.....I am giving it to my short girlfriend
2.0,a lot larger than I thought
2.0,The color was dark brown not the brown that was ordered.
2.0,These tank tops were too small for me because I've had 3 kids and alot of belly hang ... I washed them did not put them in the dryer and they still shrank significantly which really sucked ... wish I could return them but I don't think they'll take them back since they've been washed<br />Maybe a size or two higher MIGHT of made the difference?
2.0,Hat is good enough but I found myself wanting. Not bad for the price though.
2.0,"These would actually be excellent shorts if it wasn't for the poor quality waistband. The fabric is good, a little thin but not bad and they are a good long length. If a waistband that rolls down doesn't bother you, these are the shorts for you!"
2.0,"They’re just okay. The fabric was not even on both sides so it’s kind of silly looking. Looks super cheap too, like I made it myself."
2.0,"Right out of the packing the bra was falling apart at the shoulder seams. The material feels like a swimsuit. It fits in a way, but not well enough to not fidget with constantly….it’s odd. I ordered it in 2 colors and will be sending both back b/c the quality is crap."
2.0,This hoodie looks great but not for men that are big and tall.
2.0,I ordered a medium because that is what I am and this dress would not even go over my shoulders much less my whole body. The dress is way too small.
2.0,Returned. Wouldn’t last long.
2.0,I would not purchase this again. Cheap jewelry with ugly color combos. Only used one belly button ring the rest I threw away.
2.0,Charms falling off and lost
2.0,Way WAY too small - sent for refund.
2.0,These weigh too much. They slip out vs balancing like threaders should.
2.0,"im 5’9 160lbs the large was way too big, and my return request was denied. Overall okay quality. Super disappointed how baggy it is"
2.0,Poor quality. Fabric is not what I'd call a good material. Very light and flimsy.
2.0,"Received these Jan 4, it's now Feb 23 and they don't look nice anymore.  The fabric is pilling and I only wear them when driving."
2.0,It’s light it actually has legit rhinestones that sparkle!
2.0,It was returned because it was MUCH smaller than I expected.
2.0,Don’t listen to the reviews. Ordered a size up in band and cup and it fit like I ordered a band and cup size up. Ordering again in my size.
2.0,The fabric doesn't lay right in the bust area it comes unfolded.  The fold needs to be seamed or glued it doesn't stay in place.  I love the rest of the dress but the bust area needs to be fixed.  Had to return.
2.0,I bought this for my daughter and it was a bit too thin of material. I ended up returning it and getting a refund. If you’re looking for a short skirt then I’m sure you would like this.
2.0,"Liked the style, but not the sizing."
2.0,"The sizes of these T Shirts are made for Asian men. It's made in China. I bout three large size for my husband, who is 175 pound, 5 feet 11 inches tall. They are too small. Each one of them are different sizes,although the tags indicates size &#34;large&#34;."
2.0,"These broke soon after I got them :( they were cheap enough priced it wasn’t worth returning though. Sometimes good prices equate with good quality and sometimes not, like with these..."
2.0,Buyer beware! The glasses  as shown in the picture with a solid lenses are not what you get. The reason that they say it’s vented is because the lenses have cut outs all across the top of the lens. For me that is a really distracting feature.
2.0,way to small marked x-xl but looked like small
2.0,The little guy lost his body. Only the head remaining.
2.0,"I loved everything about this bonnet except that all the sparkles started shedding the day I wore it, and it’s not easy getting out of own eyes let alone kids."
2.0,Funny watch. Not great quality
2.0,"It is too large for me. The quality is okay, but the size does not fit me. I have to return it."
2.0,Used sanitizer wipes on this and made it so cloudy you can hardly see through it. Make sure to just wash it with soap and water. Lesson learned.
2.0,"They were cute. BUT they came broken and bent up, the lenses were popped out as well."
2.0,"You take a chance when you order mixed charms and this order was no exception. Of the 73 charms received, 11 were anchors--a little too many unless you are a sailor. I may be able to turn the  6 ""i💙softball"" charms to the backside and add a bead to the depression of the baseball.  There were only 2 copper filigree connectors, which I would have used but they are pretty flimsy so not sure if they withstand a connection anyway.  Overall I was disappointed in this order as there were not enough charms that I will use.  I wouldn't recommend."
2.0,"nice, but little transparent the white one, I got one in grey and for some reason the grey one felt softer"
2.0,"When stretching to put on, small clips break  and band comes out from watch and then is unable to reattach. Two broke first time I attempted to put on. Size is not too small because it is actually loose once on."
2.0,I was so excited for this sweater. It looked soft and warm and a little sexy. What I got was a very thin top. It looks nothing like the picture at all. The buttons on the sleeve are a cheap looking silver despite looking brown in the pic. Very disappointed.
2.0,I was disappointed in the fit. It was not exact to size. I wear a 12/14 and it didn’t fit to size. The material used on jumper was thin and cheap. I returned the item for a refund. The color and design were nice though.
2.0,They fall apart when washed
2.0,My husband says it hurts his feet.
2.0,"I like the patterns and they are soft, but some socks won't stretch enough to fit over my foot (size 10) and others will. Some of the chevron and striped socks have annoying threads on the inside that my toes get caught on. They are also thinner than expected. Wish I could return them, but they are already washed. Will be replacing soon."
2.0,Looks jeavy duty and adorable. But the tag broke off the necklace om christmas day. The ring holding the tag to the chain is cheep. 2 stars for dissapointing my son on xmas
2.0,no era la medida prometida ERA MAS CHICA  NO ME GUSTO NADA
2.0,This is really hard to take links out of!
2.0,"Love these wallets and the color, I bought one a few years ago and it lasted forever! However it seems they are not made like they used to, this one has already started to show wear and tear."
2.0,"Super shear fabric, like all over. The sleeves are sheer, the top is sheer, and the bottom portion is sheer. Just about the only part that isn't sheer is the middle where the fabric is gathered. It also has no give and is smaller than expected."
2.0,"I bought it it was great as long as I didn’t have to was it, I did what it’s told inside the jacket and it’s like that now. I’m a little furious."
2.0,Glasses are beautiful but came bent
2.0,"I bought these sports bras for running and hoped they would provide significant support for my DD chest.  These sports bras run a bit large; I bought a XL and about 3 miles in, the elasticity begins to go.  There is less support if the padded inserts are taken out.  Unfortunately, after two washings, the padded inserts disintegrated and the covering peeled off.  That is very disappointing.  I would not purchase these again and do not recommend, especially if running long distances.."
2.0,Sandals will fade and the material it’s coated with bleeds into your skin. Could be toxic.
2.0,The logo was at the bottom of the shirt and was very baggy.
2.0,"Although ""inkless"", near the end of the first roll it started printing blotchy and light, like it was running out of ink. It also started printing off center."
2.0,"way too loose , I am a size 2 and a small fit me way too long and loose from my arms"
2.0,"I was not impressed at all with these buckles. I wasn't expecting much for what I paid and that's what i got. Functionally they seem to work just fine but there are a lot of rough edges and several of the whistles make no sound at all. Unrelated to the quality of the product, for those of you thinking of making paracord bracelets with these they are BIG. I'm a big guy and they were way to big for my wrists. Overall the product works it buckles and the firestarter/flint make nice sparks but the finish quality is not the greatest."
2.0,"I was searching for a pair of sunglasses that I could wear while windsurfing, with a hydrophobic coating so you could still see through them if they got sprayed with water. I chose these since these were advertised as being specifically designed for water-sports. I was very disappointed in them. The hydrophobic coating is a placebo effect at best; even right out of the package I could tell no difference between these and a pair of &#34;regular&#34; sunglasses when I put a few drops of water on them. Second, they felt very cheap, and the rubber nose bridge started detaching after one day of use (it appears one side was not glued on properly). I was so disappointed in the quality, I am wondering if they are counterfeit goods, or if Ocean really is just a cheap brand. I would have returned them to try my luck with a different brand if I were not on vacation. I hesitate to wear them further - who knows if the UV protection is as ineffective at the hydrophobic coating (no way for me to tell if it works or not).<br /><br />Pros: Nice design, Retention strap is comfortable and effective<br />Cons: Poor construction quality, hydrophobic coating ineffective<br /><br />Summary: if you are looking for sunglasses to wear to the beach, these might be ok; but if you actually plan on going near or in the water, I wouldn't recommend them."
2.0,I COULD NOT ATTACH THE MAGNAFIER TO MY GLASSES !!!!!
2.0,"I loved this cover up. I wore it once, washed it and then it completely fell apart."
2.0,"I bought these for my 11yo son and they fit well. They seemed great at first but now after only the second wash, one of them has the nose piece wire poking out. And it’s not a plastic-coated bendable strip of some kind, but pieces of wire with sharp ends.  I’m sure with this construction, the others in the pack will suffer this same fate soon. Oy— still searching for comfortable quality masks that can be washed regularly."
2.0,"I love the look of this bag. The downside was the bag had a horrendous smell on the inside, like a chemical fabric smell. I sprayed half a bottle of Febreeze in it and it still smelled, and I finally just threw it in the washing machine. It still smells, but it's better. I also don't like the opening in the top isn't very wide, so its handled to get your things in and out. Overall for the price, ok, but I wouldn't recommend."
2.0,this item was too small for me.
2.0,"This is just an ugly shirt. And if you don’t think it’s too ugly to wear, you have a problem washing it because of the black and the red. The black turns the red reddish blackish gray. Not attractive. I would love to have my money back"
2.0,color.  to big to fit right to hold glasses in place
2.0,looks like a big momo on
2.0,The shirt itself is not good quality. It is irregular. One side is shorter than the other.
2.0,Nice looking watch but not for everyday use. I loved wearing it everyday bit it broke within 2 weeks.  Guess its a good show watch to be used occasionally.  This is the second of such watches that broke- so stopped ordering them.
2.0,Don’t care for material it’s made out of.
2.0,You get what you pay for. It's ill fitted and looks as cheap as it is.
2.0,Corren muy pequeños..!!! En cuanto a la calidad me gustó son confortables y bien calientitos
2.0,"The attachment doesn't seem like it would last very long, sent it back."
2.0,"Had to get a size 8 I wear a 7.5 , they are hard, not a comfortable fit flop to be wearing all day!"
2.0,Broke after 2 months.
2.0,"The guidance on this item is to order one size larger than your usual. I did and my guess is my regular size would have been too small, but what I got was too large, and just seemed like an odd cut regardless of size. More importantly, the fabric feel is super synthetic. If you like that sort of thing, you will love these pants. Not for me."
2.0,"El producto es de buena calidad. Pero no me enviaron el color que pedí , por lo tanto , no es lo que yo compre en definitiva"
2.0,"This top is not a tank top, it is a crop top. It is also just a bathing suit top. It is bathing suit material. I am 5’7” and 195lbs. I wear a size 40DD in bras. I wear a large in shirts. I ordered a large and it is so tight on me. I would not recommend this shirt."
2.0,"tightening handle broke, had to improvise and use a visegrip."
2.0,We all know what the concept of this product is. So it definitely does the job.<br /><br />This product runs extremely small like two sizes too small. Arm pits are very tight so no flexibility or nice comfort. I wouldn’t buy this again.
2.0,"Was disappointed, great dress, horrible zipper."
2.0,The stones start looking cheap upon inspection. Ring loses its appeal up close.
2.0,"I bought the watch band in ""yellow"" and it is not yellow, it is tan.  Quality of the band seemed okay but I really wanted yellow.  The watch band went back."
2.0,"very low quality, eyes is not match, mask is just a piece of a flat paper."
2.0,The back part is a lot bigger than I thought it was going to be. Andy the color started chipping off pretty quickly (after 2-3 uses) They also made y ears sore after a couple of hours.
2.0,"Usually wear medium gloves so ordered medium, but even with matching measurements I found gloves quite tight. Nothing on label of glove or instructions mentioning that it is UPF 50, which was the reason for purchase, they are described as biking gloves only on the label. Since not made specifically as &quot;sun gloves&quot; they don't extend out beyond the length of the palm and with the velcro closing there is still an area about a keyhole wide that will be hit with sun, even with long sleeve shirt. I have purchased another set of different gloves to replace this one. Would consider ordering up a size if you want these as biking gloves, for sun gloves I would put in more money, bought these at 15$."
2.0,"I'm not satisfied ..........luckily I spend very little for this slave bracelet,  does not fit haven't and won't get to wear it.  I consider myself as having fairly large wrist this bracelet must have been made for an Amazon woman with giant wrist ....way to big,  I'll have to reconstruct the chain links to shorten them ....not worth it .....as I said in the beginning very unsatisfied"
2.0,Runs a bit large
2.0,"My 9 yr old son wore these for a 2 week vacation, where we did some moderate hiking at national parks. The shoes did great scrambling over big boulders and other slippery surfaces. They also easily get wet and take awhile to dry. Since our vacation, my son has only worn the shoes a handful of times, but like other reviewers have stated, the front tip of the sole is already coming apart from the seam. It's a shame, he loves how comfortable they are and the ease of the laces. I thought Keen was a good brand, but I don't recommend these shoes."
2.0,Stained my ear
2.0,material seemed on the cheap side --
2.0,"Liked the price. Liked that they arrived quickly. Loved the dark lenses as I have severe sun sensitivity. However the lens on one side of these glasses will not stay on the glasses. Continuously popping out. I’m going to just throw them away. I love the Locs brand and I don’t know if I just got a bad pair or what, but I won’t try this style again just to be on the safe side."
2.0,This dress doesn’t fit well if you have a large bust.
2.0,super short. fabric bad quality....  not worth it.
2.0,Fair price.
2.0,I brought a medium because I usually wear a small but I think these are little girls clothes because I could fit the arms and it's wayy to short. Worst material ever so I just end up just wear it as swimsuit cover.
2.0,Maybe I didn't look or read the description better. But I was disappointed when I got 1 instead of 2 tops. Thought I was getting the 2 pack.<br />I'll just order from the Suzanne Somers site next time. I suppose it was a little cheaper for the 1 but darn sure it would of been a better deal if it had been the 2 pack.
2.0,The bands on both the top and bottom were way too tight to be a size large and the top has zero adjustable straps.
2.0,Not to impressed with this product.  Band is either too loose or too tight.
2.0,"Wasn't expecting the rings to be so small. Because they're so small, it's difficult to menuever into my septum. I'd get my money back if I could."
2.0,I won't buy again and the pads inside don't stay put bad product
2.0,"These look so cute and were exactly what I was looking for, BUT they are soooo tiny they're a real disappointment.  The actual circle is close to, or smaller than a dime in size.  I was looking for something at least the size of a quarter.  The measurements listed are way off.  What really annoys me is I somehow ended up with 2 pairs instead of 1."
2.0,I like this dress/blouse but I don't think this should be considered a dress it's more of a top that can be worn with leggings too short
2.0,These are beautiful and delicate But I thought they were a little oversized and too big for my head. I also bought them from two different sellers. The first one sent me the wrong pair.
2.0,"Really wanted to love this one but the dress has no liner and is a thin material. Could 100% see through the dress if you have any slightly dark undergarments on. Ended up returning due to that. I ordered a small and it still seemed big. I am 5'6, 130 lbs and typically wear a 4 or 6."
2.0,"Nice blouse, but sizing is way off. I normally wear a medium, and based on reviews ordered the xxl, but though the blouse fit bodywise, the arms were still very tight when buttoned, and I do no have big arms."
2.0,"I love my dress, it fits perfectly great."
2.0,"This was pack of 3, grey was good.<br />Black was xs size I guess and red was small.<br />And Red color is really bad shade, disappointed."
2.0,"Not what I expected, but it will have to do - I will need to attach a ribbon to tie under my chin because the hat is too small to stay on.  I have never had this problem with an adult hat before.  Overall, it is just not what I expected for the price paid."
2.0,Well made. Pretty colors. But way to small for my husband's feet. Had to return.. Hard to have to do that.
2.0,Light is just not bright enough. Still can't see inside purse even when on.
2.0,This is a nice shirt but the button hole on one of the sleeves is still sewn together. Therefore it is not possible to use the cufflinks which is the whole purpose of the shirt. I will see what the return and exchange process is like and then update my review.
2.0,Dislike nothing like the picture!
2.0,Just know that after you wash it DON’T dry it. It shrunk in half!! Gave it to my 8 year old granddaughter!  It also faded really bad. And I waited a month to get it. Don’t buy this
2.0,So the price and design are great but the fit for me was a bit uncomfortable.  Not to mention the snap closure came undone on me!
2.0,"the nose bracket nuts where loose when I got them,"
2.0,Nice look as expected but not a snug fit unless you put at least 4 cards in. Hard to put cards in. Bought for my teenage son who has 1 credit card and his i.d. Too loose. If I shook it  the card fell out.
2.0,too slim in the rear.  Has no room for women's behind.
2.0,They're both broken!
2.0,POCKETS WAY TOO SHORT
2.0,"I could not tell any difference with or without them. The night glare from headlights was not minimized at all. But they are cute. A little big on my face, but I have smaller than average head."
2.0,"was really happy with these at first, but they do not have enough stretch, realized the crotch was ripped in multiple places after taking it out of the wash so had to throw away. I do have to squat to the ground frequently at work. Hopefully I did not wear it like that the week before without realizing!"
2.0,its tight must run small get size or 2 bigger
2.0,In the picture it looks like a soft gold gilting. It is as bright as a disco ball. No shape. Very boxy.  Returned immediately.
2.0,turned color other than gold
2.0,"sent it back.  too small, and inside fabric not soft."
2.0,"It runs very small, the material is thin and it is way too short to be called a tunic.  I normally wear a med and ordered a large (I have a 34 bust) it was tight across the chest and hips."
2.0,It looks good but the mesh band is flimsy and narrow for size  of the face. If the  wider then it would bend back and flip...no clasp hook
2.0,Return in process cos the gold one was broken but the silver one was still intact. Regardless they are both nice looking.
2.0,You can see through. Don't like it.
2.0,I super like it. I love the color. Just on time when delivered
2.0,"Not great product, made of low quality material."
2.0,"I've been using this band for 8 months. I like its light weight and slim dimension, but there are some negative's.<br />- When the band gets wet, it emits an unpleasant smell. I usually let it dry before wearing it.<br />- The quick-release pin completely fell off after 8 months of use, so it is not usable any more.<br />- Sent in an email to the maker, asking about the pin problem. I haven't got any response from them.<br /><br />Update: The seller sent me a replacement, but the quick-release pin fell off again after only 2 days of use."
2.0,"A size 7 from one company is too small and a size 7 from another company is too large. We have tried 4 different companies and this was the case for each although there were 2 size 6.5 that fit the same profile of too large or too small. The only way for the correct fit is to try the gloves on at a store. We tried this and still found no real success.<br />It amount to try, try, try and then try again for a good fit."
2.0,"I knew going into this that we'd have some duds.  I mean, for the money, what do you expect.  I was pretty discouraged that 22 of the 40 lights didn't work or barely emitted any light at all. The kids I got them for had fun with them but it seemed like a waste of money to only have less than half of them actually working.  I took a chance and knew that going into it but this might have been a little much."
2.0,"Way too short, the model must be a short one; didn’t like the waist line-had to take it out"
2.0,"Too bulky, wouldn’t hold pearl good. Some of the hearts were chipped."
2.0,Wife says it was too small
2.0,"I must admit that these are very attractive headbands, and the velcro ensures that they will fit perfectly. But I don't think they should be called sweatbands (unless the purpose of a sweatband is to make your head sweat!) I'm not sure why they chose to line these headbands with fleece, rather than, say, terrycloth or just plain cotton, but these bands would really be more effective as something you'd wear in cold weather to keep your head warm. I was looking for something to keep the sweat from dripping down into my eyes during a workout, NOT something to make me warmer during a workout!"
2.0,Not bad quality but I am a size 4-6 32C bust and the large was still too small!
2.0,"Really wouldn’t recommend it only if your using it for just straight work out and not all day wear, you’ll get annoyed, will tend to keep pulling down adjusting etc going to just stick to my other waste trainer"
2.0,"Honestly, I'd say the only upside to this product is that it looks cool. Let's get into it!<br /><br />Now, I'd like to be clear and say I did read the reviews before purchasing, so I knew it'd be fragile! However, I'm sad to say accidents still happen and I wore it a grand total of one time before it was knocked off a counter and shattered on impact.<br /><br />But I'm sure you know about that already, so let's get into the other issues.<br /><br />The mask isn't comfortable to wear, at all. The cords it comes with in order to tie it on are a struggle to make tight enough to even stay on your face, and once I did manage that, the mask rubbed very uncomfortably on my face. It moves every time you talk, which is both uncomfortable and nerve-wracking, as you have to worry if it'll fall off and shatter. The cords themselves are also a very uncomfortable texture to have rubbing on the sides of your face.<br /><br />The material is very cheap and lightweight, and it's really not that well-made for the price. I honestly probably wouldn't spend more than $5 on it. Currently, my hope is that I can hot glue the pieces back together and make something out of it.<br /><br />As for the paint job, it looks plain and cheap. I was in the middle of repainting it to suit my needs when it broke. It really just seems like a cheap kid's toy.<br /><br />All said and done, it looked alright and drew compliments, and it did its job for a few hours. I just really wouldn't recommend using this for anything long-term, unless you plan on doing quite a bit of modifications!"
2.0,Fit is fine.  It’s rather short bigger problem is that the material is shiny
2.0,my teeth turned blue
2.0,"The suit was too small, but is well made. I have to return it."
2.0,I don’t normal write negative reviews - but I’m dissatisfied with these sandals for my son. They are pretty flimsy and look & feel cheap. I would expect these sandals to be $10 (instead of $20) for what you end up getting. We are returning our pair!
2.0,A little cheesy looking
2.0,"This thing feels pretty sturdy but the second day I was wearing it and closing it one of the prongs easily pushed out one of the grommets, I think I can still wear it for a while but it is only a matter of time until it falls apart, I wish I had an army navy store near me so I could have avoided this purchase."
2.0,Pretty dress but the waist is much higher than pictured. Material is very thin. Not very excited about it.
2.0,I like the leggings but the small hue corduroys I have gotten in the past were a full size smaller.  These are too big.
2.0,"Nice packaging and probably what you would expect for the price - but NOT fog proof. My kids complained when skiing and tubing that they fogged. I checked and they did. My $24 pair worked a lot better. If on a tight budget, this will protect the eyes, but it will be cloudy. Recommend spending a little more and get something that is fully functional."
2.0,"I was really surprised. I purchased one in black a couple of months ago and really like it. In fact, I like it so much that I bought one in red for my other car. However, in less than a month, the tiny rivets that secure  the leather to the chrome base have fallen out. Guess I just got a bad one."
2.0,Hook broke after first use
2.0,Very sheer and the arms are a little baggy. I ordered my regular size. If I ordered a size down my stomach would show. I'll keep it as a PJ top I suppose
2.0,"This is a TERRIBLE quality. The beads are printed on the material, which is fine. But the picture had a VERY low resolution, so it was extremely pixelated. NOT worth the price at all. On the plus side, the fabric used is very soft and the mask is comfortable to wear."
2.0,it smells weird
2.0,I’ll be returning. Bottom too small
2.0,Very hard to get it and you have to stretch them to fit yet still pretty uncomfortable and then the end that just rest on your nose is sharp. Wore for maybe half and hour in total
2.0,Absolutely adorable but does not come with the snaps pictured we had to sew them on ourselves. Fits our 16lb 9 month old perfectly.
2.0,"I purchased this dress for our xmas pictures this year. I am 5'7 and weight 165 pounds and ordered a L. This dress was very unflattering on me. I have an hourglass shape, but the dress just didn't look right on me. The belt is the only thing that gives this dress any shape to it, other than that it look like a paper sack. The material was a little tough, but may soften with washing. The shoulder and sleeves were tight when I moved my arms. Gave this dress a 2 star because I don't think the size measurements are accurate. Returned."
2.0,I didn’t really like this dress it was definitely see through. The color was nice
2.0,The underwear are alright. The seems in the white undies seem to fall apart the fastest.  I ordered two packages of these and both of the white ones already had holes in them in less than 3 months. I have spent so much money on these underwear that you would think that the underwear would stay together for a prolonged period of time.
2.0,Nice color but too tight.
2.0,"I have one of these dresses in purple, it’s really cute, this printed one, not so much. The print doesn’t match the picture and stretches awkwardly if you have a chest, the fabric is not what I expected, and the way the seam is done makes for a really unflattering fit. Returned the same day it arrived. 5’7” 158 lbs, size medium"
2.0,This wasn't the highest quality garment and got a hole in the pants seam after first wash. Otherwise a nice design but flimsy fabric
2.0,"Band is poor. Lost the strap holddown part weeks after purchase.  Otherwise, watch is superb."
2.0,"Cute shirt, didn’t fit though had to return"
2.0,Super see-through. The top was fine but the bottom was not. Definitely cannot go to the gym in these
2.0,No son gruesas no tienen mucha eslastecidad  nada q ver con lo q esperaba
2.0,"Pretty colors but is very short, more like a tunic top."
2.0,"product okay, just too small and delivery took too long.  ordered 2 sizes larger than what is currently worn and not enough."
2.0,Wayy too small. Looks very pre-teen on
2.0,Not what I wanted too small perfect for a little girl.
2.0,Seams come undone after a few washes
2.0,"While the product seemed nice, heavy, well put together... only one made it out of the bag because the description was incorrect and didn’t work for me"
2.0,Toooo tight! I am an average small frame woman. This is made way too tight.
2.0,It broke as soon as I put it on. It was cute but not durable at all.
2.0,too  small
2.0,I wish I could give these a 5 star but the zipper is broken 🤦‍♀️  I so wanted to wear them this weekend.  They are beautiful great  material. I normally wear size 8 jeans so I ordered a large they fit perfect.
2.0,"They look fine, until you put them on. They are REALLY oversized and don't fit my face the way I expected them to. I won't return them ( the seller has other frames that I want to try). I will just give them to my niece with a big head. These are made for people with a big head and there's nothing wrong with that, they just don't fit me."
2.0,I sent this dress back.  I didn’t like the fit or the feel of the material.  It didn’t seem like it was made well and I don’t know how it would have held up. Sent this one back...
2.0,To be quite honest I do not like these clip on sunglasses at all.  The two main problems are the large gap between the sunglass lens and my eye glass lens.  This gap allows side light to enter and reflect off the inside of the sunglass lens. This is very distracting and potentially dangerous as i intended to wear these while driving and piloting planes.  Also the spring clip is not easy to use.  These are not what I expected and cant use these for their intended purpose.
2.0,"The actual strap seems ok, but it arrived loose in the box, and without the spring bars to install it into the watch. I have contacted the company, but without any response for close to a week.<br />4 star band, seems ok, cant actually test it, generic low quality &#34;leather&#34; armband<br />1 star company"
2.0,So much furr/ cotton came off and was all on my shirt
2.0,Very irritated. As soon as I took the jacket out of the bag it came in- 3 buttons just fell right off he jacket! Very angry- luckily I know how to fix these kind of buttons and did so. When I pay for a brand new item it sound come to me it perfect condition. Reading the reviews before purchasing I had great faith in the item. I didn't return the item because the jacket fits great otherwise and I get compliments on it. Bottom line- if I buy a new item it should come to me perfect not with buttons falling off. Future buyers be cautious.
2.0,"Very prett on the model. But the shirt ran extremely small. I’m not sure that the next size up would fit, that’s how small it runs."
2.0,Like fit style. Fabric snaggy.
2.0,"If you are looking for a slip then this would be perfect. Maybe if they found another material it would be fine. Also the bottom flares out need a little more work on the bottom. The design is of the dress is pretty, again not the material."
2.0,disappointed with how cheap this looks<br /><br />I was hoping for more but should have set my expectations straight with the low cost of this item.<br /><br />I love costume jewelry and probably wear it more frequently than nice jewelry because I tend to lose things way too easily. However I will say that a lot of my costume jewelry looks almost like the real thing. This does not.<br /><br />Save yourself a couple of dollars and skip buying this item.
2.0,more of a midi length rather than ankle length
2.0,"This is NOT TRUE TO SIZE. It was too snug around the waist area, I usually wear a XL, I got the XXL. Made in China. The material is soft."
2.0,This suit has a very short torso. Im 125# and 5'3 and ordered the small. Wish it fit because it would have been cute!
2.0,Description is misleading. I recieved 2 bandanas and 10 filters. Not worth $20.
2.0,It was ok. I ordered it and only wore it once. That tells you it did the job for that event but I don’t live it.
2.0,Fell apart really fast this should not have happened for the price I paid
2.0,"The idea of a ""one size fits all"" for readers seemed convenient as periodically I will switch between 1.25 and 2.0 depending on the task at hand.  I'm currently wearing 1.75 cheapie readers and sitting a comfortable distance to the computer screen.  However, upon first wearing the One Power readers I found myself having to sit closer to the monitor for ideal clarity.  Trading discomfort when sitting for clear vision was not what I expected.<br /><br />  BUT, clarity was not he basis for my 2 star review.  These One Power readers have a mild distortion in the lens and this makes them intolerable to use for more than a few seconds. Headache inducing.  Anybody who has ever tried on regular wrap-style sunglasses is familiar with this phenomena, where the glasses may be clear enough, and the image crisp enough, but something is ""off"" and disturbing to focus.  The One Readers are not a ""wrap-style,"" rather a conventional reader profile, so this distortion was a surprise.<br /><br />  I thought maybe it was me, so I gave my eyes a rest.  After a few minutes I went to my ""go to"" test, my computer.  First with my regular cheapie readers, and no problem.  Then the One Readers, and the distortion was immediate.  Then back and forth with my other readers, but only had the problem with One Readers. Bummer.<br />  Possibly it was a defective pair, but sorry One Readers, for me it's a fail."
2.0,"I had to return these as they were way smaller than shown.  My daughter is a size 2, and the sarong didn't come close to meeting in the center.  The fabric was nice and the we liked the ruffles, just needs to be about 10 inches longer."
2.0,t-shirt material was plain beige and the trim was gold with very little shimmer. nothing like picture. fit was true to size.
2.0,They run small. Very tight cleat
2.0,"This is a very cute lace top. Doesn't have much support for boobs, I would recommend wearing a tank top underneath. Some areas of the shirt are see through. You have to hand wash and hang to dry or the lace on the shirt starts to ball up. It ran a little small (length wise)"
2.0,"The straps were spaghetti straps, not like those shown in the photo.  It did not have any give.  I loved the color and wouldn't recommend it for plus-sized women with large breasts.  The description said that there was some stretch in the dress.  The fit is poor.  This is making me pull out my sewing machine on simple designs like the picture shown and do it myself."
2.0,The band holder broke after the first day of wearing.  Not good.
2.0,"Too little structure. Lace is soft, but doesn't look exactly like the photos. The keyhole in the back is pretty, but the bottom zipped section is needing elastic or a stiffer material."
2.0,The pants are very thin almost see through material. The belt on the pants is an olive color so doesn’t match with the outfit since pants are yellow and shirt is white and silver
2.0,the pants definitely to small I had to order pants from another company but the material from which the shirts and were made is great material just the sizes were to small(pants)
2.0,Nice colors. Soft. Too short. Made more wide than long.
2.0,Thin. Very thin!
2.0,I'm 5'10&#34; and it fits me like a tshirt. But it's soft and cozy...better to sleep in....
2.0,The service was not bad but the design on the mask was so blurry I would not wear it.
2.0,The top was way too small as well as the skirt. Beautiful outfit just too small.
2.0,"Unfortunately, the dress was tight through the bust and the zipper pulled. I did measure before ordering but I was concerned that with an active day I would rip the dress. Also the fabric has a phrase printed on it. You can not see this in the photo"
2.0,No support to speak of and was sized a bit tight. Returned.
2.0,Chain broke very quickly.  Necklace was bigger than advertised in the photos.
2.0,They fall down very easily which makes running extremely difficult.  Consistently have to pull them up...very annoying.  The fabric is different than others by the same brand I have bought in store...a shame because I love my other ones.
2.0,"Ordered these socks as they say will fit mens size 10.  They run very small, and washed them once and they shrunk to a very small size.  Too bad.  Will give them to a lady we know."
2.0,Thought it was as sturdy as it looked but it needs something inside it to prop it up. Was disappointed.
2.0,"Poor quality, Colors slightly different than shown. Wouldn’t buy again."
2.0,"I measured my boys feet and used the size chart, but they were way too small.  Go up in size if you are ordering these."
2.0,"It’s an ok sweater.I like my sweatshirts baffle so I bought an xl, this fits me like a medium.<br />Fabric is on the cheap side."
2.0,Yuck no shape and it looks nothing like the picture I thought it flowed out but it was just a box. Definitely sending back
2.0,Super cute but chain broke before it was ever worn. I’m sending it back but currently don’t see any option to buy again  at the same price.
2.0,"Bracelet broke after 2 weeks. They looked nice, just weren’t durable."
2.0,The outfit is very rough and itchy and not quite as the size states
2.0,"Cheap. The smell is this product is overwhelming. Cheaply made, fit is ok."
2.0,Waste of money very thin material and the print suppose to look like cow. No more like a dalmatian.
2.0,"Made from light weight canvas. Looks nice from afar, but feel cheap to the touch. What worse is it was shipped folded in half (folded bottom), and the wrinkles stay all over the bag. Disappointed!<br />I order one made with PU, much much much better both the looks and the feel.<br />Oh, The strap feel and looks cheap, too."
2.0,I have serious doubts that this is hardlex. My wife has worn the watch for a week and it has scratches all over the face for some reason. She is a teacher and does no daily activity that could cause these scratches on hardlex. Never put it in her pocket so no chance for keys or coins to damage it. I’m shocked that daily wear for her could cause over a dozen small scratches from 1mm to 8mm.<br /><br />Otherwise she is satisfied with the watch. Seems to gain 17 seconds a day which is acceptable to her but obviously not great. I am going to have my local watch dealer look at it and give me his opinion.
2.0,couldn't breath in the chest area. other than that it was pretty perfect. go a size up for sure.
2.0,"I ordered the size 9-12 and they were far too tight. I normally wear a men’s size 10.5 and they were too constricting to be comfortable. I ended up giving them to my wife. At least she says they are comfortable and help wick away sweat when she goes running, but I wouldn’t recommended these for men with average/large feet."
2.0,I thought I was ordering a normal fit tee. What I recieved was a crop cut and very large for a 3t size. It's for a gift so I dont have time to return and get a new one. Hopefully they like the cropped fit.
2.0,The color was saposed to be orange and it was more like Corel my Daughter was very unhappy about that
2.0,They did not feel hard like a boot supposed to feel I can squeeze the boot in my hand
2.0,"very pretty but see thru, I returned the two I bought, fabric was somewhat rough too to touch , not soft"
2.0,"I returned this item because the outside of the sleeve was not hemmed on either side. It was simply cut material that had arleady begun to roll in on itself. Cute dress, but not well made."
2.0,Materials looks very cheap. Easyly scratches. Would not buy again
2.0,"Very cute earrings. They are pictured with two different kinda of fasteners. Make no mistake they are clip on earings. They also broke and the charm fell off in the first five minutes I had them out of the package and with one time of trying them on. You get what you pay for. Since the charms are usable, I will just repair them myself."
2.0,"All pictures do not accurately depict true earrings. Sadly, they look inexpensive. The worst part is they came broken. The stud is detached from the post. I was unable to glue it back on. Very upset."
2.0,Cans leaked.  This has been going on for a while now.  Red Wing can't find leak proof tops?
2.0,"The picture shows how I received this. Over all the product was great, except the small circles that hold the charms on were bent and opened, 2 of the charms were not even attached.  I would have requested a refund, but did not have time to return it as it was for a graduation party.  Luckily my husband was able to repair it."
2.0,The idea is cool but it arrived with pieces unglued and hanging loose. I didn’t expect perfect but getting something that was well wrapped but still damaged was disappointing. Would not recommend.
2.0,Didn't work for me. Pulled at wrong angle for me.
2.0,"I wear the nose ring but I was really looking for a pop of purple, the stone is so small you cannot tell it is purple."
2.0,I love my errings I can use them for daily use and dress up. you will not regret your purchase gold or silver both are beautiful.
2.0,Very cute looks just like the pic but this is one of those outfits to where even if it comes in your size that maybe you still shouldn't put it on. It was too short to fit me comfortably maybe if i was a thick hobbit but I'm not.
2.0,No air can go in and out. It makes you sweat like mad
2.0,Ordered a girls size 3 and it was sent in European size 38. Which I believe is closer to a size 5. They are cute but VERY flimsy.
2.0,"I hardly ever wear it, because I don’t like the way it fits. But now after one wash, I for sure won’t wear it anymore. The color is completely different and looks washed out"
2.0,"It was just ""ok"". Kinda of too much for me"
2.0,Not a great fit but for $8 it’s ok
2.0,"My wife watched as I pulled the shirt out of the package, and she burst into laughter as soon as it was unfurled. The thing was MASSIVE. I ordered a size medium, and the shirt I received was the size of an XL or XXL. I'm 6'1"", 175 lbs. I donned tent (erm, shirt) long enough to snap a photo and then packed it away immediately to be returned. I don't think I'll bother to buy a size small if these shirts all run three sizes large. On the plus side, the fabric was very soft. Two stars for that."
2.0,Mask is flimsy and cheap and was bent upon arrival and never improved after opening it. Made it hard to wear. Disappointed daughter on Halloween.
2.0,"The zipper was of poor materials, it kept snagging on itself. The sleeves were way to short for it being an extra large. I ended up returning it."
2.0,Not very durable broke the long strap in the first week.
2.0,They were more girlssize than a women's.
2.0,It is a lot smaller than I thought it would be and there is almost no gold or color variation.
2.0,The print nor the fabric was what I expected it to be. The fit was off too
2.0,Not red color more of a coral / orange color and narrow shoe. For the price not a bad Summer shoe
2.0,It had a lot of potential but the sizing is wayyyy off. Super disappointed 😔
2.0,Unfortunately after a month of going to the pool the color diminished from Purple to light purple to patchy white spots and looks worn out like been used for years. The design is nice but the coloration is very poor. Truth.
2.0,This product is not like what’s pictured. It is very thin plastic that isn’t shiny or metallic. It’s gray. It just comes in a plastic bag. The back has 3 very cheap pieces of squishy foam and isn’t padded at all like the photo. This is definitely a dollar store product that has no business being marked up to 25$
2.0,"A bit too flimsy. I tore a hole in the side while putting one on. Black on black makes it a bit tough to see, though. Due to their elastic nature, I doubt that darning will be a success."
2.0,Shorts are pretty long. Material sucks!
2.0,"It works, but factory defect caused a clicking sound 5 days after use.  Solution was to place tape along the sides to prevent rubbing of plastic on plastic.  Machine is quiet enough but lacks any refinement.  For $35 it does its job but I could not recommend this to anyone looking at it unless you were in dire need of a budget watch winder."
2.0,"I liked the product, but it was too small, and the inside tie came off immediately."
2.0,"This product looked super cute in the photos but... it shows every little fingerprint and smudge, it doesn't fit snug on my phone (it makes cracking noise every time I touch the side with power button on it), it feels like it is not good quality, and with the case on it is difficult to use the fingerprint scan on the back of my phone. Overall, I like the way it looked in pictures, but it actuality, it is not a good case. I don't think it would actually protect my phone if I were to drop it on anything other than carpet. I would not recommend this case to anyone."
2.0,Very tight even for my small 8 year old
2.0,"This was on our doorstep in a clear plastic bag, it looked like a cloth ball in plastic. It looked like someone had worn it before."
2.0,I didn't care for this shirt. Not sure why. Maybe the sleeves. I just don't like it. It's not that cute in person or on.
2.0,"I purchased this dress last year 2017 and absolutely loved it. I've had no problem with shrinkage or color fading. I was shopping for a new dress and saw this one and I thought I'm going to get another one because I really love it. I went ahead and purchase it again 4/2018. It arrived and I'm sorry to say the quality of this dress is terrible compared to the 2017. It is about 2 inches shorter and the stitching around the elastic is all bulky, the material hangs over the elastic. The blue, sky blue and pink are fine."
2.0,"They slide around on your feet .  Before you know it, the grippers are on the top of your foot.  Sometimes the grippers feel like small pebbles on your feet and are not the most comfortable."
2.0,"Runs smaller than what they say!!! If ordered you should order 2x the size you would normally wear. Also very thin material, can almost see through. Cheaply made and wish I hadn't ordered it."
2.0,"I wear a shoe size 10 and these socks were very tight.  I gave them to my granddaughter; a size 7, in womens, and they fit perfectly fine."
2.0,"[[VIDEOID:b97fa78f95632f956bb331852a461d33]] I purchased the wallet in October 2017. By December the wallet began fraying at the CARs slots from insertion and removal of my credit cards.<br /><br />I contacted them through Amazon and they did an outstanding job resolving my issue. Quick responses to the emails and they quickly replaced the wallet.<br /><br />As far as the quality, I guess that you receive what you pay for. Love the size and fit but t doesn’t appear that it’s made for any reasonable longevity.<br /><br />Update July 2018. After just a few months with the replacement wallet and the credit card pockets seams are all ripping out again.<br /><br />You would think that at any price that you could get a year out of it.<br /><br />Try other options."
2.0,The bill was super long for some reason. Stitching was great. Product was returned because the bill was extra long.
2.0,This was a disappointment because it does not look like the picture.  It is much darker with a lot of black in the butterfly.  It was a gift and it was too late for me to get something else.  I wish it looked like the picture b/c then I would buy one for myself.
2.0,"As many other reviews note, the neck hole is massive. Like, twice what it should be. If they made it normal, it would be my favorite shirt in the world because it is so comfortable. But it just looks ridiculous with the massive neck. Look at the photos."
2.0,"This was definitely not made for working out, there’s no support. You can see the pads"
2.0,Didn’t work for me....
2.0,"The fastener keeps coming loose, It has fell off numerous times. I don't expect to have it for long."
2.0,It  works kinda. Go to hold it together<br />not well made.<br />will have to find 1 that will last
2.0,The product photo make me think it was 5 sushis but I only received one.
2.0,"Unbelievably heavy and extremely uncomfortable to wear. The skimpy padding they send isn’t nearly enough to combat the sharp points inside that dig into your face. My son was so excited about this and he could hardly stand to have it on at all. The interior points left bruising all over his face, and that’s with as much padding as I could add without suffocating him"
2.0,"After 6 months of everyday use (i dont use it while doing sports), the color starts wearing out and the lock doesn't close completely"
2.0,Cute but very cheap quality
2.0,It is very cheap material. Fortunately the company gave me my money back.
2.0,"Definitely not bathing suit material, more like shirt material. Torso is very short, does not cover buttocks - fits like a &#34;very cheeky&#34;/&#34;thong&#34;. However, can use as a body suit and wear with shorts."
2.0,"I ordered a large and it fit like a small on me. I normally wear a medium size but got a large since that is the size of my other sweatpants & they are more comfy when they are a bit looser. I really like the look of these but unsure if I will order again but if I do order again, I will be purchasing an x-large."
2.0,I thought if i got it a little bit bigger than what i wear it would fit as a loose dress on me. It was super tight and really short. very disappointing cuz it looks reay cute and felt super soft.....average body build doesn't for this unless maybe i go another size up. 5'6 btw if anyone wanted to know height.
2.0,I like how the dress fits.... but the material feels like bathing suit material which is a little weird. Doesn’t feel breathable. Returning it.
2.0,"description said: ""Material: 100% Genuine Cowhide Leather. Soft, Durable and Breathable""<br />but the crosshatch leather black variety I ordered & received is definitely NOT leather nor soft. Feels more like plastic.  I had read reviews that said cards may fit tight, but since i was expecting leather i figured it would break in over time.  There is also no ""YuhanPretty"" logo inside or out as shown in the pictures show, which is fine with me but not sure why the pics show something different. Not sure if i received a wrong cheap copy or if they are all like this..."
2.0,"They looked good and my black pants arrived yesterday. However, I found the color came off after I tried them on. Not happy with that"
2.0,Not made well broke the first day
2.0,The board they're attached to left marks and I couldn't smooth it out
2.0,so the pants fit small as compared to other 30s I have bought for my granddaughter.  I returned the item and was charged 15% for shipping. Beware....
2.0,Very light and easily breakable. The turquoise stone are plastic. 2stars for the aesthetics
2.0,"So bummed!  They are actually really cute, but even with pant slip under, they cling and stick to my legs.  I really wanted to like these, so much so, that I bought slip pants to wear under them and they still don’t work."
2.0,I just received my shirt yesterday it's very cool but it runs very small. Hopefully over the winter I'll lose weight so I will be able to use it next spring.
2.0,"Pattern is very cute, quality is quite decent, comes in an adorable box. They are just HUGE GRANNY PANTIES. I thought they'd fit more hipster like title"
2.0,"Returned,  fit weirdly  and the material was heavy and thicker than expected"
2.0,[[VIDEOID:cd3fbddf96c3de6208030c6918dd0128]] Great price it looked better on the photo but in person like I said in a video I’m really upset that the fasten buckle is silver and the watch facing that goes over the watch It’s supposed to be more of a rose gold and it’s really not a rose gold it looks like a purpleish  color And it’s glitter
2.0,Too expensive for the quality and fabric type.
2.0,There are many of these belts listed and I didn’t choose the one my friend did evidently. The quality of the belt she ordered was much better. The leather quality is ok it is the GG buckle that is not up to par in my opinion. The coloring seems off and there is no way to return so please read everything before buying.
2.0,It can keep my head warm. Bluetooth receiver might be defective. It has to be just a few feet away from the source to sound properly. It cut off about 10 feet. It try on my laptop and my phone. the result is about the same from both.
2.0,Didn't even try it on since it arrived stained
2.0,"It's not as advertised, size it totally different"
2.0,The small fits like a medium and the top is see through. Looks cuter in the picture. I returned it.
2.0,The shirt is a nice color but fits really small. I would recommend going up a size or two. My husband likes it and was disappointed that it didn’t fit.
2.0,"This would have been an awesome all around type of clothing EXCEPT it was restrictive in the leg area. I normally wear a large, bought an XL. Couldnt take a normal step while walking because the crotch area was so restrictive and tight in the thigh area. I guess it could be comfortable if you dont have thunder thighs like myself."
2.0,wouldn't buy it again. barely made it to the second trip.
2.0,Only half are as described. The hoops are only an inch. Disappointing.
2.0,"Loved the color and softness of the fabric, however, I always a little disappointed with the quality of the stitching. The stitching was messed up in a few spots. The dress fit, just not as I would have liked, so I will sadly be returning the dress."
2.0,Thematerial is very thin.
2.0,"cute style ,fit right, but look cheap I returned."
2.0,"I will keep these because the price was good and the colors will work with my wardrobe.  HOWEVER, these are much shinier than pictured on the screen, having an almost satin-like sheen to them.  Also, the colors are not near as deep and rich as pictured.  They are significantly lighter and brighter.  The red scarf is more of a fire engine red, rather than the ruby.  The purple is a light violet, instead of the deep amethyst/royal purple pictured on the screen.  They seem decently constructed, but BEWARE you will NOT be getting the same colors as you see on the product page."
2.0,Too tight not comfortable or giving. Got a medium.  Not true to size.  Runs small. Think large or xtra large would be better. Just not the material i was looking for either
2.0,"I wanted to get some glasses to protect from COVID exposure. Since I am Asian, I don't have a prominent bridge of my nose. Because of that, and because these glasses have extra protective sides, the top protective side digs into my eye socket, and it doesn't fit on my face. I bought pads for the nose bridge to see if that would fix the problem, and while it sits a little better on my face, the extra shielding on the glasses still digs into my eye socket. I can't wear these glasses.<br /><br />2 stars because the case and the anti-fog cloth included are nice additions."
2.0,"The flannel was not at all plush or soft and the fit was small.  I liked the color which was more vibrant than I expected.  I would have returned the pajamas except by the time I paid postage for the return and a replacement, combined with the first postage payment, it would have been more than the cost of the item."
2.0,They tore up my daughters top of toe. They made her big toe bleed. Throw away.
2.0,"The prongs aren't long enough to fit all the way around the ring, which is narrow 1/8&#34;.  I went to kay Jewelers and they had the same one that worked.  I paid them $10.00 and they put it on for me.<br />I'm very disappointed in what you sent and I order thru Amazon a lot."
2.0,Material it’s not that good but it’s was a nice present
2.0,I loved these at first but the button broke after two washes. I guess you get what you pay for!
2.0,"In order for the dress to hold the shape in the picture, you need to use the African fabric. What do you get instead? 1-sided, machibe printed/processed polyester (or worse) that lays flat and has no interior color like the picture.<br /><br />Very disappointed."
2.0,Waaaay too small🤬
2.0,When you fill the card slots it will NOT button. It's difficult to get buttoned even without cards in it. Don't put your ID in the clear window because you'll never be able to get it out again. The othe card slots are also a tacky-feeling fabric and it's hard to slide cards in and out. Wouldn't recommend.
2.0,Cheaply made....very cute but already ripped on the ruffle on the bottom. I bought another one in a different color and that one was thin and also now ripped in same spot. I won't buy anymore
2.0,"Not the correct size to small, never had to send any shoes back before this pair and I buy over."
2.0,"Have had these shoes for 7 months, worn approximately twice a week. Today the outer stitching/rubber framing around the shoe lifted and the shoe is coming apart.  Not what I expected from a $54 children’s shoe.  Stride Rite has never fallen apart."
2.0,It was a bit short
2.0,Smells bad when arrived can't wash it the frontal image comes off
2.0,"Very cheap, but I can deal with it for one night. Too bad the hat was ripped."
2.0,Looks nothing like this on
2.0,I ordered the size that I always wear and that is comfortable on me. It is too tight in the arms and through the back.
2.0,"Very tiny, way overpriced, 925 sterling silver or not.  Boo"
2.0,Awesome shirt but runs several sizes to smaller ..
2.0,The shoes although my sons size were extremely hard to get on his feet and then were very tight. They are really nice shoes I just wish they fit
2.0,"These are very cute but the head band isn't very sturdy, so it just slide around in your head. These wouldn't withstand a trip to Disneyland"
2.0,"It's cute, but PEOPLE IT IS NOT GOLD!!!!! Not even silver! Don't take a shower with it, or no pool party! It turned black in 3 days :("
2.0,So I’m a 34c and always wear my shirts in a size medium..this shirt just fit weird and small. The straps around your shoulders are not adjustable and with the material of this shirt not being stretchy at all makes it a tight fit. The neckline on my chest sits awkwardly and the shirt is super thin. I wanted to love this shirt but I’ll end up returning it :(
2.0,"Like the look, but ordered two of the same style with the exact buckle and same size.  One was more than two inches longer than the other."
2.0,Nice and cool but not water resistant
2.0,"It was made ok, fabric ok. But the zipper unfortunately made the ftont of the outfit bulge and look odd."
2.0,"The lava rocks didn't fit into some of the charms. Some of the charms didn't close properly after they were opened. Almost as if opening them broke something in the clamp. The ""egg"" shaped one came and was already completed warped. It was uneven with it's clamp. Two stars because the usable ones were really cute and the metal quality was good. Definitely wouldn't buy from this vendor again, tho."
2.0,Was too large.  Ordered according to suggested information but wasn't correct.
2.0,Center/main jewel fell out on first day.
2.0,TOO SMALL FOR A NORMAL SIZE ADULT WRIST
2.0,"Material very flimsy, very sheer and stretches a lot."
2.0,It worked for the purpose I used it but the top didn’t match the shorts.
2.0,"My wife purchased the &#34;OVERMAL Handmade Adjustable Rudder Anchor Charms Multilayer Bracelet Wristband&#34; for me as a Christmas gift and this item is terrible! The clasp broke after wearing this item for the very first time! I sent a message to the Seller and my request for a replacement went unnoticed (Seller did not reply) which is really disappointing! My wife is understandingly upset, too! I hope that the Seller (MFR) and/or Amazon.com will take note and supply me with a new product at no charge to me."
2.0,Waste of money and time.
2.0,The piece is nice.. Not worth what i paid for though. At all!!  Could find cheaper
2.0,Very poor condition.  Sawing on this purse was not done correctly.
2.0,"So they all say XS but as you can see when I lined them all up by the left edge they’re 3 different sizes. Only one of these looks like a true size XS. Looks more like XS, S, and M. The two smaller pairs fit ok so I probably won’t be returning but be aware they look cheaply made with inconsistent sizing. Hopefully the pink ones shrink a bit in the wash."
2.0,Too small. They left a visible indentation around my 3 month old's head when I took off the headband. Was sad I had to return them. They were so cute.
2.0,Very cheaply made. The pouch came with a hole in the bottom and it took only about a week of use for the cases to start corroding.
2.0,Far too small for my size 10 1/2 feet. I can stretch them on. But they are too tight and uncomfortable.  Look nice though. Would probably be ok for size 7-8. Missed my return window or I would send them back.
2.0,"Hat does not fit well if you have a small head.  This is also the first hat I've ever purchased that is made of polyester/nylon.  I prefer headwear made of cotton, straw or wool.  In other words, natural fibers.  For me, this hat is like wearing rubber on your head in this hot and muggy Louisiana heat.  Just glad I didn't pay that much. I'll pay more this time and get a couple of the Outdoor Research Sun Hats."
2.0,Way smaller then I thought....If you're big busted...don't get.
2.0,"Nice length and soft quality. However, the side pocket for the golf balls adds bulk right on the side of the hip because it’s ruched for more storage and sewn into in the worst possible place. The second pocket is flat but if I put my phone in there it looks bad because it sticks out visibly. Terribly unflattering unless you are Twiggy. Sending it back."
2.0,"These things certainly feel sturdy. Whereas a Snappi creates tension across the entire front of the diaper, these just grip each side to the front, not creating as much tension. They also do nothing to cinch up the bottom of the diaper, which allows the legs to become loose. We're only about 50% on Snappis stopping a poop from escaping the cloth, but I think the Boingos are worse. My wife prefers these for some dang reason but I sure don't care for them."
2.0,"Way too small, and poorly made.  If you're above a C cup, this won't fit you."
2.0,"I have enjoyed these sunglasses for almost 2 years. They are very light, comfortable and look nice. Unfortunately, the rubber like coating that covers the plastic frame has started to deteriorate, giving a sticky feel to the frame when handling it. I purchased these glasses less than 2 years ago. I will be looking for another pair, that do not have a rubber like coating."
2.0,When I opened this it had a hole in one of the socks. Bummer. Returned.<br />Was super soft and looked good quality.<br />However... Too bad CONTROL quality.
2.0,"I would return if I could. These do not hang right. They are crooked. Material is much thinner than what I was looking for. The material, which felt soft at first, got rough with washing."
2.0,"I love how these look and how small they are-- they fit on my earlobes fine and hug close to the skin, so they don't get caught on things and don't look super noticeable. However, once I put them in, I have been unable to remove them again. They're to small and smooth to get a good grip on to open once in the ear. So, if you buys these I really hope you like how they look, because they might be in your ears for a long while."
2.0,I bought a purple Chuvora gem stone for my wife this past Christmas.  She loves it and wears it wonderfully.  So I thought I would get her another one for her birthday.  Well it just came and it is so dark.  All I can see is black no blue.  This pendant doesn't look anything like the photo.  The glass is good quality but it is very misleading from the photo.
2.0,I ordered an XL... seemed.to fit like a M... sent it back...
2.0,"Arrived in the mail.  Nice color and fit.  However, the velcro fastener in back for one strap was literally hanging by a thread  It was not sewn across the strap  It was supposed to be a gift  Disappointed, to say the least."
2.0,"Ah, unisex means small.  I have an average man's wrist and it didn't fit. Luckily there is enough room for me to punch 2 more holes.  This is really a woman's &#34;one size fits all&#34;  It's okay but thin material."
2.0,"The material was almost swimsuit like.  Followed size guide but was way too small on top, so stretchy it was see through.  But, on  the other hand my teenage daughter can wear it & it fits her better😊"
2.0,Based on other reviews I bought this a size large (I'm a 32D and bought a 34D) and the cups fit but it was too large around. I returned it and got one in my correct size (32 D) but the cups are way too small. I can get it on and it definitely keeps me in place but is really uncomfortable and leaves marks on my skin.
2.0,"Discription was deceiving, way too big for earrings or necklaces, are only good for keychains . But they are coloful and sturdily made."
2.0,Runs a bit small material kind of junkie like the arms they were kind of sheer but not real sheer but the body material was just crappy
2.0,"Unfortunately, they had tears in them after first wash. Not at the seams, just in the middle  of the fabric. I had high hopes for them."
2.0,I ordered a 3x and it was very short.
2.0,This dress is cream and black.  It was cute but not what I wanted
2.0,"bought this for Florida was really looking for just a nice simple white tank you could dress up or down.  First when pulling it out of bag noticed right away was not a bright white, defiantly more creamy white.  I bought a large just thinking its on the cheaper side so  I thought go up to be safe, well I am usually a Med to Large and it was very loose and big, a medium would have been better.  The material wasn't bad I didn't feel like it was super thin or cheap just very wrinkled and a loose baggy look."
2.0,"Decent quality print, but they are so small! My husband could not get them on his US Men's 9.5 foot. If he could get them on they would be short ankle socks and not mid calf crew socks. Best for a child or small woman."
2.0,It was bigger than anticipated
2.0,Impossible to read through swim goggles the numbers are too dim
2.0,Way to long!!!!!! Order these alot and these were way way too long
2.0,"I guess there is no substitute for actually handling a wallet before you buy.  This one isn't terrible, but out of the box with nothing inside it was as fat as my old wallet that needed to be cleaned out.  Once I got just my license and a few credit cards moved over, the new wallet would not lay folded shut.  The leather is OK, and the flip up ID window is handy.  There is a zippered pocket in the cash storage portion of the wallet that I think is the culprit on thickness and its zipper pull pushes through the wallet leaving a bulge on the outside of the wallet."
2.0,"The product arrived in a PLASTIC bag, talk about CHEAP! I thought, &#34;some of these are broken, for sure!&#34; Surprisingly none of them were shattered so I tested them out. 19 out of 40 did not work! They would not turn on and they're glued close so you can't change the batteries. The only reason I didn't return them was because they were only $7.10, not even worth the trip to the post office. I suppose 21 lights for $7.10 is still a good price, but it's not what I expected. On a good note, the 21 lights that did work were really bright and the batteries lasted for quite a while. But I probably would NOT buy this product again."
2.0,These are so tight they give me a headache and leave marks on my head. I can’t even wear them. (My  Head is not abnormally large or anything lol)
2.0,The shoulders are a little tight fitting  due to the lining.
2.0,"So I wasn't expecting a lot, based on the price, but these are just a waste of money. Immediately broke the silver one because the clasp wouldn't come undone. Damaged the gold the same way, and then there was the hassle of trying to re-close the clasp once it was inside the piercing. Never again."
2.0,FAR too small. NOT usa size by any stretch of the imagination. Order at least 2-3 sizes bigger than you'd normally wear.
2.0,"Loved shirt's message, color, and softness but it was several sizes too small."
2.0,This thing will be shedding sparkles until they’re all gone
2.0,Not sure at this time if I am keeping them
2.0,"Okay. Great idea but it tears after 2-3 months. This was my second one and never again. I would wear this under my uniform with a gun belt. If you wear compression shorts, it slides up and would not stick. Going back to good old shirt stays."
2.0,"I loved the way this looked but the band had a pin drop off and then a part of the link came loose and now there is no way to fix it. It happened while I was traveling and the ""window of time "" to return it has expired. I didn't know there was a timeframe on defective merchandise"
2.0,"Most of the charms were broken before i even tried to put them on my crocs, and about 4 broke while i was trying to put them on! Very bad quality"
2.0,Disappointed because I sized up and it was still too small. Great color and soft material though!
2.0,"It is very flimsy and looks very cheap, Very disappointing"
2.0,"It's bigger than I had hoped for as a child's hat, but my daughter will be able to wear it a long time if it holds up. Not sure about the quality, though...black thread material showing through on a pink hat? Cute for the price in my daughter's Halloween costume."
2.0,Sizing should say kids instead of girls.
2.0,Was working fine until that band broke. The silicone busted in half behind where the watch clasped. Wouldn’t buy again and wouldn’t recommend.
2.0,The fit of this tank is terrible. It is far too long on the top and short on the bottom. I am short waisted with a large bust and I cannot wear this tank. If I went a size smaller to fit in the top the length would be way too short. Disappointed.
2.0,"This jacket is 1) well-made; 2) heavy and not at all flimsy; 3) SO poor-fitting that it's like a Matryoshka Doll (Russian nesting doll). I *wanted* this jacket/coat to work for me, badly. I'm 5'6"" and 145 pounds. I ordered a Small. The sleeves were a bit long, but not too. The shoulders were perfect. The upper part of the coat was fine.<br /><br />But then. I don't know what was going through the manufacturers' minds. The hips literally form a ""S"" shape with the waist--on both sides. It seriously was as if the coat was made for a matryoshka doll. I returned it the day after it arrived, and I'm really sad I had to write this review, because if the coat had been properly constructed, it would have been the steal of the winter."
2.0,I ordered a large it was to boxy but yet not long enough for me but I am 6’1” very snuggly material
2.0,It does not light up!
2.0,The stickers themselves are really quite pretty half of them I cannot pick off for the paper and if I can't get them off the paper then the sticker rips or tears you better off going to your local pharmacy and getting stickers for as long as I waited for these ones to come to go over a month to come very frustrated
2.0,Comfy and looks like the picture till you put them on. Fits on the legs but.... Waste was 2 sizes too big and soooo much extra material in the crotch area like I have a pouch it's really weird looking. Guess ok if wearing a long shirt or tunic
2.0,The cheaper models are not worth the money. Not impressed at all. Maybe the more expensive models look better but i’m not gonna find out.
2.0,"Does not adjust to fit..  One size..  Otherwise, it looks exactly like the picture..  Have never seen a cap that didn't adjust to fit.  :-("
2.0,Item was much much smaller than expected :(
2.0,"These don’t stay in position once in your ear, I tried them for a whole day and I spent most it trying to keep them positioned correctly on my ear."
2.0,"These pants are preposterously small. Pulling them out of the package they immediately struck me as &#34;child-sized.&#34; Their sizing guide lists the length as 74 cm, which is 29&#34;. Out of the package, these pants felt like very thin, crisp cotton sheets, am measured 68.5 cm, or 27&#34; FROM WAIST TO HEM, with an inseam of 14.&#34; I didn't even bother to measure the waist because although they might stretch out to the max, the front of the pants where there is no elastic--with the button closure and pleats, to the side pockets--is very narrow and if the back elastic is stretched out fully it would certainly make the pants hang oddly. THEY RUN VERY SMALL and the cotton is thin and crisp, NOT FLOWY."
2.0,"I was super excited about this dress because it looked really cute in the photo.  I was still excited when I received it (the fabric is very cute and although it's thin, it isn't see-through), but then I put it on- firstly, it definitely runs a little bit small, but also the way the top is constructed you'll never be able to tie it behind your neck and still cover your chest... like at all.  Very cheaply made in that regard.  Could maybe work as a swimsuit cover up but even then, it just fits awkwardly."
2.0,Tummy control??? No. They're actually looser in the tummy than they are in the legs! They're a weird fabric composition because they don't feel very stretchy like spandex normally is.
2.0,Very comfortable but does not block the sun as advertised only worth 5 bucks
2.0,"I actually thought I sent this one back.  Its pretty, and fits well.  I'm not crazy about that particular fabric."
2.0,"Cotton was labeled first, it wasn’t, it was so clingy"
2.0,The shirt seems to be of good enough quality. I ordered on xl and received a shirt marked xl but it is more like a medium. Very disappointing.
2.0,"This top could have been cute, it just wasn't cute on me. I feel like it ran snug and the fabric was just thin enough that I felt like I looked cute if I didn't move, but sitting was not an option. It was definitely long enough for leggings. I think someone else could look adorable on this, but as a 12/14, I feel like it didn't offer enough flow or loose-ness for me to be comfortable. The look of it is adorable though and I love the long sleeves."
2.0,"It would probably look good on someone else, but my head is pointed and it looks awful on me.  Plus it was too big for me"
2.0,"Purchased a medium, came in a bag labeled &#34;large&#34; but clothing tag says medium? Fits very very big for a large."
2.0,Is not wrinkle free.  I have to iron them.
2.0,These earrings are really big...for me<br />The earrings may work depending on the occasion.
2.0,Cute but not quality.
2.0,Minute hand froze after one month of very gentle wear and no water exposure. No extremes of heat. Just stopped working. The day and date dials kept running one or two days behind and needed to be adjusted at least once or twice a week. I wish I had just shelled out the $$$ for a solid designer watch with quality that lasts.
2.0,"Pretty and solid, but, the chain broke after only one wear."
2.0,Very pretty and dainty earrings. They broke after wearing one time. Very disappointed.
2.0,"One of the stones fell out only after the second time wearing it, so I had to return it. I would have given it one star, but gave it two, because I really liked the design.  But overall, very disappointed with the quality.  Will not be ordering a replacement."
2.0,Turned toes green
2.0,"2 of the earrings came bent, and the backs that came with them are too small. 2 were good, 2 were poor"
2.0,"The size is super small, the fabric is like a thin disco- stretch polyester. I'd be okay with that if it weren't super small. I can't pull it over my head!"
2.0,Run tight get half size up
2.0,Did not like the fit. Returned.
2.0,"I purchased these earrings as a backup option for my everyday jewelry for my mother's wedding weekend. Unfortunately, I felt that the delivered product left something to be desired. I didn't love the way they looked on my ears, so I made the decision not to wear them and return them."
2.0,"First, the lenses is plastic (not glass as the description reads) and the purple is more of a darkish pink, AND, they arrived super scratched, probably because they where in a plastic bag with no insulation. Second, there is no foam lining around the lenses, making wearing them for any long periods of time uncomfortable.  I do like the chrome color on the plastic frame, and that is the only reason I gave 2 stars."
2.0,"What I received looks almost nothing like the picture. It is very thin, you can see right through it, the colors are not bright and vibrant and it is way too short to be called a ""Dress"". I bought it because it was cotton and bright and inexpensive...turns out it is just cheap!"
2.0,cheap fabric. Returned
2.0,1 was made okay the dark one is flawed and not made well.
2.0,The metal part started fading the first day. The package had a funny smell
2.0,Just realized the lens is NOT polarized even though Ralph Lauren advertises it as having polarized lens! That was the main reason I bought this pair. Can't return it now that it already passed the return window. POTENTIAL BUYERS BEWARE!!
2.0,I like this product its my 2nd time ordering this shirts but 2 out of 3 shirts were in mint condition while the white tank was all full of this weird marks all over. Seems like its packaging because the other darker shirts were sealed tight rolled together with this one. I would give it a higher rating once seller can correct the problem
2.0,A Did not last very long before peeling and breaking.
2.0,"Zippers are quite fragile. Although I have not experienced a zipper failure... the pants material is thin and the zipper is weak, so I do expect a failure.<br /><br />Definatley wash on a delicate xycle or by hand.<br /><br />Material is thin, and feels good on a hot day on the trail... but feel rhe material is very thin and will easily tear. As is, not sure I would purchase more"
2.0,"These earrings were as described and very pretty.  Unfortunately after only a few wearings, the pearl fell off of the setting.  I was unable to repair it myself and I was unable to return them.  I have ordered other jewelry from Amazon.  This is the first item that has disappointed me."
2.0,"At least two sizes too small, but the person I gave it to absolutely loves it!"
2.0,"I initially ordered the small because I usually do small but can sometimes do medium.  When I tried it on, the smalls were entirely too tight in the waist. I definitely don't want to sleep uncomfortable, so I returned it and ordered a medium. When I got the medium, they were still REALLY tight in the waist. The top was great and comfortable on both the small and the medium but these are not for women who have had children :)<br />If you don't have the stomach of a 21 year old, don't order them. Unfortunately, I had to send the mediums back as well."
2.0,"Top ran really small and pants were way to long. Also, top is black while pajama pant is Navy. You get what you pay for so if you can I’d buy from pajamagram."
2.0,Fit was nice and very cute. Pockets  made it stick out in a weird way but the main thing is the fabric. It’s basically swimsuit material and also snags like a bathing suit. I wore a soft belt with it and it still smashed all around the waist.
2.0,Sent back. Hideous color for pants on a 70 year old.
2.0,Very thin for laces that are listed as wide. Was expecting at least 3/8 but got 5/16th. 7 bucks down the drain.
2.0,"Not all that warm, I use them as liners under my work gloves."
2.0,This product requires ironing and was sold as wrinkle free.
2.0,"Not what I expected at all for ""sweatpants"". The fabric is similar to Dickies work pants/coveralls, but thinner. Not breathable at all. Might be fine for cold weather hikes."
2.0,"Poor quality, colors of earrings don't even remotely match, returning, should have known this would be the result given the awesome price...you get what you paid for."
2.0,Very hot for your head. It feels like 102 c. Also badly made hair strands falls.
2.0,"For $30 I was expecting a dress that was at least decent…this was not. Zipper is the cheapest simple kind you can probably find at Walmart, fabric is rough and wrinkly, and hem line all around is absolutely crappy (see photos). I’m 5’11” and 185 and only ordered an XL because I wanted to be sure it wouldn’t be too short…only to find out he XL fits like a medium (on the smaller side). Not worth the effort to buy, be disappointed and return."
2.0,"Very thin material, some irregularities in stitching and the zipper tends to get stuck. Such a shame because I love the fit and style."
2.0,About as good as one could expect for the price. Half of them started falling about after about 7 months.
2.0,I ordered a XL because I wanted it to be oversized. It’s so small. It’s like a kids XL for sure!
2.0,"The socks that I received are not as shown. The cuff is about 1/4"" above the stripe at the back. In the picture shown, they are not that low. I'll just gift these to someone and try again."
2.0,Extremely tight. I would size up. Ultimately ended up returning it and no reordering. Has a nice concept
2.0,"Extremely see-through. If you try to wear it braless, everyone will see your breasts. Even with a nude bra, it is too revealing. The front needs an extra layer. Going to try to sew something in. The back is very sexy."
2.0,Too small. Dont buy
2.0,It is missing  the bow tie and cufflinks
2.0,"The fabric wasn't very nice, and the fit was not what I wanted in nice comfy pj's. I returned them."
2.0,"Runs large. I sized down 2 sizes and the fit is decent, otherwise it would look like a sack. Material is a bit rough and the sewing quality isn’t great. Definitely not worth $20."
2.0,The aquamarines in these earrings were beautiful. The settings were flimsy. Some of the prongs were not even tightened down. I lost an emerald out of a pair of earrings with similar settings. I had to send these back.
2.0,"Overall, I liked the dress fabric, color, and length.  What I did not like was how the stretchy fabric was in the front and not the back, made for an uncomfortable fit.  I returned."
2.0,This bra squishes the breast down awkwardly instead of giving lift.
2.0,Great color but the material seemed cheap to me. It just felt kind of big and frumpy.
2.0,They’re ok. Poorly made in my opinion but it’s just some night clothes for my boys who will be grown out of them in no time. I would recommend.
2.0,Not watertight it failed when tested and had water inside does work for snow though and I have had pieces of plastic chip off as well as the stand quite staying in position and ripped off.
2.0,"After reading the reviews, my husband got a half size bigger and when he received them, they're way too big. Do not go up in size, even when layering. Have to return."
2.0,to small for my husbands neck
2.0,"The product looks like awesome.<br />But I always wash my new underwear before use it. I did it, but now they have a tint mix.<br />Please see the pictures attached"
2.0,"Pretty, but quality is not very good.  It looks like it has been used.  Gold is very dull.  It was a Christmas gift or I would probably return it.  Looks like $30 necklace instead of $124 necklace. Hopefully doesn’t turn my neck green."
2.0,These were way too thin. You could actually see through them. Not what I expected. Returned.
2.0,Sounded great in the reviews but… material is that nylon knit that isn’t great and fir was way too big and long. Bought a small. I’m 5’2” and 118. They need to make in xsmall
2.0,"Even allowing for the wrong fit, there is not enough &#34;stretch&#34; material to make a significant difference in one's form. I wouldn't waste your investment."
2.0,Not sure description matches pants..cute though I can make it work
2.0,Pulls together for cleavage but flattens.
2.0,"It’s very cute, but the band is thick. Also, after 6 weeks, it is yellowing and the print is wearing off. Broke shortly after"
2.0,quality on par with a walmart Halloween costume
2.0,Small would fit a child size chart way off. Nice brute color
2.0,initially we like the youth mission Gator masks. I got two for each of my children. My thoughts were if they were allowed to mask break they would pull them down and not lose them. That has worked. One is tight on one child and one is loose. Age is 12 for both. Each day they come home wash hands and wash the masks. They laid the wet masks on the white porcelain countertop and stained it. So far bleach has not taken the dye off. This concerns me since they are breathing this in and their breath is moist. If I had other better options I would not purchase these again
2.0,Way too small. Not very comfy.
2.0,Feels like thin cheap pajama material. Awkward fit.
2.0,"If you have boobs AT ALL don't bother purchasing this dress. I ordered a medium and everything fit well except my breasts were popping the buttons apart even without a bra on, and I am by no means a busty woman... Super disappointing returning"
2.0,"Kinks up and breaks apart easily, but price reflects that."
2.0,The bottom ball is huge. Not what I expected
2.0,It is a wonderfully made garment but of course the size does NOT represent the label
2.0,"It looks well made, but the sizing is ridiculous. Im 41 inches in my hips, hot an XL and it stayed in my knees, it looks wide but the opening its extremely small and no stretch, I got 2 pairs, the second one was the black one with the zipper on front, that one I kept and its true to size and its super stretchy, but the jean one stay away from it unless you are skinny."
2.0,It seems to be a good bag but is not the advertised size.  Going to have to return it.
2.0,"It's made ok, but it's too big, vertically. This is more like half a hat than what I think of as a headband. It looks goofy when worn imo."
2.0,"I won't wear this out. It's not the color or fit I expected. Too large. I ordered a medium and am usually a medium but this felt like I was swimming in it. Also, there is a flaw in the stitch from the neckline and vertically thru the bust. It looks very obvious and is embarrassing. I would return this if I had time or patience for it. I may just wear this as pajamas"
2.0,"This is just about the most unflattering dress I've ever put on. The waist is high and just does not look good if it's not tightly cinched. The skirt portion tapers and there's a slit on one side that comes up uncomfortably high (I'm 5'7). It's very form-fitting even if you size up, which I did. The material is decent and comfortable. This dress is designed for a very petite person who is quite comfortable with body-con styles. I got this on super duper clearance and still don't want it. Normally I wear a 0-2 in dresses, and I ordered the small in this case. (5'7, 125, 34 A/B, 28, 35)."
2.0,"Bought size recommended, but they were still huge. The only positive is how soft these were...I say WERE because the drawstring on these already OVERLY large pants came out after the first wash. Disappointed."
2.0,"I was super excited to purchase this ring for I am a huge Harry Potter fan. When I received my Gryffindor ring, the exterior design was very poor. My Gryffindor flag instead of having stars looks like a pizza and the lion is just sad looking. The quality of the ring as far as durability goes is great."
2.0,"I usually wear a 1-2xl so I bought the 2xl. Although it does fit, it’s much smaller and shorter than I want it to be, and it’s very tight in the arms. If you’re like me and have wide arms, I’d steer clear."
2.0,"Bad fit, looks cheap"
2.0,Made very cheap and slightly small. Sent mine back.
2.0,I've bought some of these for my husband. This time the v neck collar were the same as a t shirt collar. Seems like the company has change its way of designing v neck collar.
2.0,Little smaller than expected and had rip down the side. Other than that super warm and cute
2.0,"The hat itself is just as ordered.  However, when taking it out of the package, the flag was already peeing off the hat front. Refund was no problem."
2.0,gave me a blister and made a hole within two days of wearing them
2.0,Does not perform as advertized.  Waist of money.
2.0,The dress shape it’s self is really nice but the print quality of the flowers was disappointing. They’re blurry in most spots and faded in others.
2.0,"At first I was so excited to be able to wear lipstick under my mask.<br />But it is NOT comfortable for all day wear.<br />The plastic causes condensation, and the surrounding cloth got soaked, after 4 hours of wear.<br />I'm Bummed."
2.0,Looks very cheep! It was not what I wanted at all!
2.0,"They run very small. I suggest buying a size up. They are supposed to be fitted, but they were I-can't-breathe-fitted."
2.0,"Its long enough, but not wide enough... seems very small and extremely thin. I bought 2, but im not very happy with my purchase. Not hijab quality for sure. They are pretty though!"
2.0,Material is not good for me...it's a bit small..I have to keep pulling it up...no grip a the top...I thought the leg would have been taller...I bought a large
2.0,The fit was fine but after 3rd washing the sleeve has come unraveled.  It is past the date to receive a refund.  Very disappointed for such an expensive shirt.
2.0,"Pretty small, plus the wire arms are kind of fragile. I overextended one of them trying to fit it on my big head and now it just swings wildly. These would probably be fine for a child's head though."
2.0,It is hard to find a great size hoop and I thought I did but the hoops are really thin and flimsy not worth the price. I didn’t even get 3 uses and they broke.
2.0,"Ordered this in an XL for our son who usually wears a Large. Still to small, so I contacted the company-more than once and they said to keep the shirt and they’d send me a new one in an XXL. They never have and it’s been a year now. I still have the brand new XL.  Quite disappointed in the company."
2.0,[[VIDEOID:3c294e5b4be4f486e679f5bbb9e8ea1c]] Short in left lace and wont turn on and no watet has hit at all not very happy
2.0,Hubby sent it back. Didn't hold his pants up like he hoped.
2.0,Mine still has the tags on it because the material is awful and I'm too lazy to send it back.
2.0,My sone wore them for a month and they ripped in the back of the slipper. He won’t wear them anymore because of it. I would expect a new pair sent or refund.
2.0,Shorts was too long.
2.0,"way too small for a normal person's neck, and the extender chain makes it look even worse"
2.0,Nice alternative to name brand sport shirts.  The price does reflect quality though - some of the necks (grey in particular) of the shirts seemed to be stretched out even though it was new with a tag.
2.0,"The color of the bag, grey, is not dark which is why I ordered it. The color is more like a faded olive green. Disappointed."
2.0,Bad grafiti
2.0,clasp was broken. I loved the purse.  It was a pefect match to my dress...but your return policy prohibited replacing it with an unbroken purse even if I returned this one...which I did.
2.0,After wearing once got a hole in the toe.
2.0,"I really liked the cut and the print, but the black color looked faded without ever having washed it yet. I returned it because I don't like faded looking clothes."
2.0,The size is not good
2.0,The watch is really large and should not be listed as Boys Girls. We are returning it because it does not fit our girl.
2.0,"Not very happy with this shirt, cheaply made, runs very big, should of returned it but kept for lazy days & sweatpants."
2.0,I rated this with 2 stars because it would be good for a small child or a very small woman the strap is not adjustable at all and it sits high up on your waist the phone case part is way small you cannot fit A note or an Apple XR  In it
2.0,It smells so badly i can't wear it and i have to go wash my neck now....the smell is making me feel like I'm inhaling poison.
2.0,"The ring is really cute and my granddaughter loves it but the ring top completely,  came apart. The top of ring separated from the ring base! My granddaughter is heart broken."
2.0,"The material the bag is made of is of such an poor quality that I don't know if I will ever use it, but it would not pay to send it back."
2.0,Extremely small im a size 6 and very slender this is suitable for a little girls waist. Not for adults
2.0,"It is the medical grade of air compression socks. It works much better than those cheaper ones. It provides much more pressure and applies different pressure on different areas, As a result, I can feel the difference. The size may not be very fit since there are not many sizes and it is not elastic enough to fit your feet (it was not meant to be). It is pretty expensive but you are supposed to pay what you get for. I feel the material very sturdy and expect it can last for a long time. However, it is not durable at all. I washed it 4 to 5 times and the toe area is torn with a big hole. I expect it can last at least the same as other $3 socks I got from Target or Costco."
2.0,"very prone to scratches, in my 1st day of use I got like 3 scratches."
2.0,"The hands are very small, and in dim light, almost impossible to read.  You can push the illumination button and, in the dark, glance at and see the digital time, but it's not convenient to do so. Also, the directions are not as clear as they could be, and it's a challenge to get the day/date programmed correctly."
2.0,I was hoping for the pockets to have zippers on them because of the product says that they are present as you scroll down. Although the Amazon description section does not say they are present.
2.0,Size is ok but looks just  as synthetic as it is. I Don't understand the hype
2.0,"I had higher expectations for this shape-wear compression garment. I purchased it in addition to my favorite compression garment for post tummy tuck purposes. The material is a cheap quality and therefore not breathable at all . It will create too much moisture and furthermore the color rubs off onto your skin, so when I removed the garment at the end of the day my scar was looking Black. I like that it does have a pee hole opening which is large enough so you don't have to remove it. The measurements were pretty spot on I should have done a Large but they didn't have large available.  The biggest downside is the material and the rubbing off onto your skin , the level of compression was just okay."
2.0,A little disappointed. They’re slightly different colors and sizes. See pics. :(
2.0,fit like tights
2.0,Do not whisk the sweat off your body very well - pretty much not at all.
2.0,Have a few issues. To start with it's MUCH longer than it looks on the webpage. It also said the dress was black but it is very clearly navy blue. Also on the page to me it looked like a pull on dress but this is a wrap dress where you wrap it around yourself and tie it. The material is also VERY thin I would DEF wear something underneath. I just really feel like the picture on the webpage does not match the dress I received at all. It's light and comfy just doesnt match the picture at all.
2.0,A hole already broke through at the toe within two weeks of use. They were great while they lasted but not durable at all.
2.0,Ordered for daughter's birthday and came in time but the pair we ordered picture wise wasn't the color we received it was much darker then what picture showed
2.0,Quite pretty earrings. Only problem is with the hooks. They easily become misshapen. Difficult to put on or to take off.
2.0,Wasn't distressed like the pic and that made it look too cheap/bright.
2.0,"The colors I received were not the colors shown which is why I bought this product, I wanted colors that would look great with brown eyes and I got pinks and purples and only 3 of the colors I will actually use. Also the glitter is only on the top surface of the eyeshadow not all they way throughout. Overall I feel as though they falsely advertised their product. Good thing only $6 was spent.  My 3 year old will love playing with the gaudy colors."
2.0,"The dress fits appropriately. Unfortunately its made out of a cheap, thin nylon material that leaves it hanging oddly and static clinging to your thighs.<br /><br />I've bought other Welwit dresses in the past and they have always been nice quality , this dress is a flop."
2.0,"This dress would be perfect with a few tweaks, one being better quality fabric. It had no stretch and was very thin. It fit very small on the bottom but large in the bust. I’m 118lbs, 5’6” and ordered a small. Unfortunately I had To return."
2.0,My 5 year old tore these shoes up in two weeks flat. I mean maybe she’s a dinosaur but I would not purchase these again. The quality was not as expected in the first place.
2.0,2 out of the 4 fit even though they all were marked the same aize.
2.0,The cups are too big!  The side hard boning is very uncomfortable. Even with the next size up.
2.0,I wanted an automatic watch that had day date and month. This had it but it was too small to see .You need good eyes for this watch.
2.0,The shirt look great on my grandson when he first put it on . But after the first wash the colored faded. Too expensive for this to happen to a Nike shirt.
2.0,Sent them back for larger size
2.0,My son loved the shoes but they literally fell apart after two weeks of normal use.
2.0,"The wrist bands for the watch are made of a very cheap plastic! They break very easily, do not waste your money!!"
2.0,El talle calza más pequeño que el talle estándar. Pedir 1 o 2 talles más.  Tela más delgada que lo esperado.
2.0,Disappointing. These are very thin and run very small.
2.0,"They are Not a bold red, as the pic shows. They are a pale pinkish cream color"
2.0,"Doesn’t look anything like described. Didn’t like how the seams were visible on the mesh part. Looked weird. Also, I just don’t have the right body type for this kind of dress."
2.0,The product doesn't fit a &#34;petite&#34; category because it was larger than expected.
2.0,Material is not that great. Zipper split within a few months.
2.0,Length wasn't long enough.
2.0,Way too small.  I gave it to my daughter.
2.0,"I liked the way they stayed up, but they got wholes around the toes, first ti.e that ever happened.....and it was every sock that did it."
2.0,It is too tall and narrow. Doesn't hold much at all.<br />I do like the fact that you can operate your phone through the plastic.
2.0,Rubber nose pieces fall off easily. All 4 of mine fell off in less than 6 months. Plastic scratches easily. Be sure to put them in the provided pouch when not in use. Otherwise good glasses for the money. Very useful for looking at phone on a sunny day.
2.0,Ok so I'm not huge I have a stomach that I wanted to be flatter for a wedding I was going to. So I thought getting this girdle like thing would help. Its 75%rubber and 25%cotton. I dont sweat normally. But when I took this thing off I was soaked which was so uncomfortable! And let's not forget you have 15 hooks like a corset. I would feel bad for someone that was really large try to hook these.  You would have to lay flat on bed and try to see hooks to fasten. And heaven forbid you have arthritis. It was uncomfortable and really didnt do what I thought it would. I would of ordered something else. And the article said something about helping with posture? It didnt.
2.0,"Pretty, but would not click shut. I wear this style all the time and no issues. Seller didn't respond when I reached out."
2.0,The band did not hold up. It broke about a week after I got it... since the band is proprietary I would have to buy a whole new watch...
2.0,"/stone is beautiful, but the back was not strong enough to support the weight of the earring. One back arrived broken."
2.0,"Fabric has too much spandex in it, cheaply made and very clingy. Also, material is super thin!"
2.0,"I followed the chart for ordering these briefs.  I ended up ordering a size larger than I do in other brands, but these were still way too undersized.  Perhaps for a person with a smaller body type, they are fine.  For me, a 6'1"" 200+ lb guy, they were very uncomfortable - tight around the legs and extremely low-rise at the waist.  I wasn't expecting something to come necessarily exactly to my belt line, but these were about a half to a full inch below it.  Sorry, but they just didn't work out for me."
2.0,"I really wanted to like this dress, but the rouching on the shoulders was cheaply done & coming apart.  It looked bad.  I returned it."
2.0,This is the third pair of minimalist walking shoes I've ordered in the last few weeks so I'm keeping them even though the ties on the left shoe don't match the right--but they feel alright for walking. Still don't recommend this brand for it price/value ratio or quality.
2.0,"This mask gripped my face just like most masks, making it uncomfortable to talk while wearing. Especially if wearing for long periods of time."
2.0,The shoulders are to small!
2.0,"I am a size 8, American. I ordered the size 8. It was way too small, whic was a huge disappointment. The shoe seemed very comfortable and I was impressed by the seemingly supportive insole. I will order a couple sizes bigger and home it works for me."
2.0,"I bought this purse with the dimensions in mind as if they started from the zipper at top to the bottom of the zipper.  I even asked if this is where the dimensions began, with no response.  It looks nice, but the hardware on the bag does not match the hardware on the handle, the color is off, oddly.  Next, as I said, the bag is much smaller then it appears because the zipper is like two inches below the top.  Next, my item came all smashed up. This is not something you can undo by allowing it to sit upright or wet it like clothing hoping to get its original form back.  Once smashed, always smashed.  I would give it a one star, but the purse is decent looking, but it has a lot of flaws."
2.0,"Tiny, and the elephant was half painted, half not."
2.0,Like how they fit I did receive the 2 but my black stitching needs to be better how do I contact seller to get replaced??
2.0,This necklace is really cute but it came broken. The dinosaur is not attached to the chain so I will either have to return it or go to the craft store and find a ring to attach it to the chain. Not worth the money for the product.
2.0,The product was just as it looked in the picture however I am 5’4 and the dress came just below my knees also I ordered an xl and it fit my 1 year old daughter who is 5’0 and 100 lbs
2.0,"Cute but runs really, really small."
2.0,"Low quality, stitching was off and mismatched buttons."
2.0,I had to return the lacing on top came loose.
2.0,Very small. Not true at all. I ordered a large. I gave it to my xs 15 yr old. Fit her perfect. Order two sizes up.
2.0,Love product.. but broke the first week.
2.0,Cheaply made. Dollar store item at best
2.0,"The blue red socks seems to have an elastic piece too tight for my calves. I didn't realize these would be made for people with small calves, so I cannot recommend these to anyone that does any exercise for their legs and have above average calf sizes."
2.0,They were too big for me. Very comfy but not a good fit. Felt too much like granny panties.
2.0,Very small and chrap
2.0,"This is a beautiful looking necklace. I did have some initial issues with it's overall quality, however. The chain is actually two parts, not one continuous chain. The chain attaches to the center portion by two clasps and two metal rings. The company provided second picture seems to show this best, if you need a visual reference. When I initially opened the jewelry box, I noticed that the metal clasp on one side and become detached from the metal ring. I was able to put it back into place fairly quickly, tugged on it, and it seemed fairly secure. The next day when I wore it, however, the clasp became detached again without me realizing it, and the only reason I didn't loose the necklace is because an astute coworker pointed it out. I took it off, brought it home, and with help from some pliers was able to make sure it never opened again.<br />Now that the issue is fixed, I love this necklace. The center piece appears different colors depending on the lighting, and can appear blue, green, purple, or even silver. I have gotten multiple compliments on it. Would rate 5/5 if it wasn't for the initial quality issues, as no necklace is worth the money if you loose it on your first day!!!"
2.0,This is cheap looking and unattractive. It's too baggy. I would avoid.
2.0,Although it fits on the bed perfectly they are not comfortable at all.  Really don't believe they are 800 Thread.  Won't buy them again.  I will have to purchase other pillow cases and top sheet so I can use it.
2.0,If you're under 60 years old you probably won't like this hat with it's massively high crown.
2.0,"Based on reviews, I ordered 2 sizes up. When I opened the package, I knew immediately that the cup size was way too small. I'm a busty girl, and  have trouble finding tops that fit,  so I always order larger sizes. I was hoping for a DD like cup size in the 2XL; boy, was I wrong. The cup size was more like a C. I decided to try it on for schnitz and giggles; maybe it would stretch and work out... Nope! Boobage was popping out everywhere; side boob, under boob, quad boob. No bueno. The suit seems well made and it was nice, but I'm going to have send this one back."
2.0,WAY TOO SMALL... I got an XL that is too tight for my head. (That's a first). I cannot wear it. Now I have to return.
2.0,"The design is painted or printed onto a white band. After very little use, the finish comes off and it looks terrible. Now - Ancool customer service made it right, and I was able to order a solid color band that won’t wear out so quickly. Recommend Ancool, just don’t recommend this particular band style!"
2.0,The material is see through when held up to light and has discoloration in the inside but cannot see on outside. I would definitely where a slip underneath the dress. I did not like the pleat on top at neck and shoulder area. The picture does not show these pleats.
2.0,Awful harsh mesh to walk in. Not comfortable at all. If you like soft things this is not for you.
2.0,It's small for adults...nice though!
2.0,I fell in love with the pj top logo and ordered my usual size L for elasticized bottoms.  The bottoms fit a bit too tightly.  I liked the top so much that the bottoms weren’t that much of a loss.
2.0,"The necklace fell apart after I had it for about an hour. The sellers were kind enough to send a replacement after I contacted them. I asked if I should send back the broken necklace. They said &#34;as long as you don't spend much money.&#34; If I'd sent someone something that broke, I'd suggest that they keep it as a sign of good faith in addition to sending them a &#34;I sent the broken necklace back to them via normal mail. The necklace broke again (clasp separated from rest of necklace again) after having it less than one month. I never slept with it on and hanged it on my necklace tree after every day that I wore it. I liked the necklace, even after reading reviews that the lobster clasp was reversed. I'm going to a jeweler to have them solder the same piece that seems to be the &#34;weak link&#34; rather than return the broken necklace AGAIN."
2.0,It’s cute but it feels really thin and cheap. It won’t last more than a few washes
2.0,Super thin fabric combined with puckered seams along waist of bodice and the bust darts sewn incorrectly.
2.0,"Nice looking, but plastic."
2.0,I got 5 styles of cats with 5 charms of each. 6 charms were completely broken and unusable. I wished there was a greater variety.
2.0,"I bought the 'Cool Robot/Iron Man' long pant. I'm usually a small, sometimes a medium. Putting these on, they were a little snug once they got up to my thighs, which I fully expected with this material.  But once I pulled them all the way up to my waist, they were way too loose and would not stay up.  I bought these to work out in, but after every few steps I took I had to pull these up again.  It was very awkward having to put a safety pin in the back just so these wouldn't fall down during spin class. Whenever the cycle instructor told us to rise out of the bike's seat, my hands had to reach back and pull my pants up so as not to moon the row behind me.<br /><br />These were a disappointment. I don't think I'll be purchasing tights from this seller again. If you have more of a square shape where your hips & waist are pretty much the same measurements, then these may work for you. The only reason I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 is because the print really is cool, and despite the fact that they were ill-fitting I still got tons of compliments on the design."
2.0,cheap quality.
2.0,Too much gap which causes the coin to slide and flip upside down. I was hoping it would keep it in place. I like the silicone though. So there's that!
2.0,"Too small, and I don’t have a big head."
2.0,"The way these are designed they will not lay flat against your leg.  The stitching and orientation of the Y joint make it so the band jets out from leg, this causes a noticeable and easy to identify protrusion in your pant leg as well as irritation against the leg as you walk."
2.0,"I'm puzzled by the good reviews.  The clamps on mine keep falling apart.  I can put them back together, but it's annoying and time-consuming.  I've only had one day wearing these in which all the clamps completely held. Usually one or two will fall off in the middle of the day, sometimes all of them.  I'm 6'1&#34; so I presume the good reviews come from shorter customers."
2.0,"They say that the max length of the chain is 16.5 inches, but it is actually more like 14.5 inches."
2.0,"Item was peach, not pink and the long edges are plain raw cut."
2.0,Does not stick as well as other similar bras (i.e. The ones sold at Target and Walmart)
2.0,"this thing is a piece of s@#t! broken in package, super lightweight...but get what you pay for I suppose."
2.0,They are soft and comfortable but you will find black fuzz all over the house when you wear these. The bottom is so thin you feel the dots meant to keep you from slipping.
2.0,Pajamas looked cute but not like the picture.
2.0,"I returned this immediately. 2 stars for cute design & quality of heavy vinyl fabric. It was well constructed but TINY. I did order a size up and it was still clearly 1-2 sizes too small.<br /><br />I should mention the moment I opened this I was confused, then angry. It’s a waist cincher suspender dress—DOES NOT go over bust as shown. After re-examining the item listing & zooming in; the model in fact is wearing a separate vinyl top that blends in with the dress. So misleading. Didn’t work for my event."
2.0,"poor stitching, especially on pocket square"
2.0,"In chose these rings because at my job I operate machines and cannot wear jewelry. The black one with the real glitter really caught my eye and I love the Chevron shape. I was so disappointed when they arrived. You can barely see any of the glitter, it's just a black ring. And the picture is misleading, they aren't as noticeably shaped in person. They also feel extremely thin and they twist easily when sliding them down your finger. So cheaply made I might as well wear rubber bands to represent my marriage."
2.0,"Was looking to use this as a tie for my groomsmen in my wedding. The color is perfect, but it was just too cheaply made. Very thin and you can see the stitching on it. I can't complain too much though because it was very inexpensive which is why I purchased just one to make sure. Smart move on my part.  I'll still use it for work, but you get what you pay for."
2.0,"These are laughably big (and I like big sunglasses) and also very poorly made. One of the lenses was too big for the frame, and jutted out over it."
2.0,Nothing wrong with the hat. I bought it thinking it was for toddler boys. Definately won't be able to use it for my son.
2.0,The frame of the glasses are small
2.0,"Very pretty but it clung too close to the body.  Believe I ordered a 2X but it didn't have any ""flow"" to it.  I usually order this size and there is plenty of room and gives movement when worn."
2.0,"I’m not a big fan. The fake leather looks too fake & kinda looks like a garbage bag. I got the coffee color, & in the pictures it looks a lot darker. But it isn’t dark at all which is what I wanted. The fit is unflattering & isn’t form fitting. I’m not sure if I’ll be able to wear it. It’s wrinkly & I’m not even sure how to get the wrinkles out. I don’t really have anything positive to say about it, which is why I only gave it 2 stars!"
2.0,"Really pretty but all the crystals are falling off and I’ve been using the multi-colored lanyard everyday for several months. It will serve it’s purpose without them, but not as prettily."
2.0,The cloth is good. The design is pretty. But it has sewing errors. Quality control is poor.
2.0,Doesn't work well.
2.0,This looked great on the Amazon website but once I got it it was very thin and flimsy.  The magnetic ends also acts up a big where you have to keep readjusting it throughout the day.
2.0,Her gloves fit big and the hat ran small:/ all i could use was the gloves. Dissapointed momma:(
2.0,"I did receive compliments on it when I first revived it and wore it, however I sousing purchase it again, it hasn’t really stood the test of time.<br /><br />I have two major cons: 1.) the chain is long in total, however the split opening is just slightly too small to make sliding it on and off easy without having to unfasten the clip. And if you try to add an extension, now the lanyard is just way too long all together; 2.) It is extremely delicate. The chain breaks a few times a day, anytime my ID card snags on anything (my purse, if I pick up a box, etc) it pops right in half. Fortunately the chain is easy enough to slip back together."
2.0,"I haven’t tried it on yet, it’s soaking after washing it in a stronger deodorizer. The one of the last things you want to experience when buying new clothing is it smelling horrible. No way this happen during shipping. It’s like a weird chemical smell. Not sure if it’s the fabric or processing from country of origin. If anyone had smelled cat pee.... its soooo strong. I washed it but it’s self... and the laundry room smelled like that smell afterwards.<br /><br />Edit: several days later, I have washed it 3 times now, there is a mild smell, I will probably soak it again and then rewash. 4 times that makes me.<br />Side note seller contacted me, saying, sorry, smell happens in long shipping, to wash it and hang it out to dry. Right, Uhh. K thanks, not helpful."
2.0,"Save your money, the fabric feels weird after only one wash"
2.0,"Cute but runs small, average quality material"
2.0,I bought 3 pairs.  2 out of 3 tore when trying to put on first time. Waste of money.
2.0,"Definitely NOT as shown in photo. Sweater is just short of body-hugging, with large turtleneck that model must be pulling down in picture, because it actually stands straight up and would cover your face if you pulled it up. Sweater is not chunky - thin model must be wearing largest size. Knit is standard, nothing special, and looks like it would get pulls easily.<br />Material is somewhat less than great. But again, the biggest problem is that the photo does NOT represent the actual item."
2.0,"They're too narrow/ tight, no cushion, but they do keep your feet warm after a while.<br />I have narrow feet and these are uncomfortably tight. I hate them."
2.0,"Let me begin by saying these are the best ones I've used so far. I've worn shirt stays everyday, for years, as they are required for my job. The clips on these are top notch and have never slipped off. The &#34;over the foot&#34; design is really comfortabe. I can only give these 2 stars though because even at there smallest (shortest) adjusted length, these are too loose for me and I'm 6' 1&#34;. This leaves too much slack in the shirt stay and then my uniform just doesn't look professional as it allows it to come untucked and fold over my belt. Great quality, but they just don't get the result that I must have for my job, deeming them unusable for me."
2.0,"I wear a 16 on top and bought the largest size. I'd estimate that this runs 2+ sizes smaller than advertised. It fits my teenage daughter, who wears a womens' size 6 to 8 or a medium, as shown in the photo. The fabric is nice but the fit being misrepresented is seriously disappointing."
2.0,"I returned it. I asked for a medium. I'm a short but fatty person. So, widht was perfect, but it was too long (I am about 4,9 f. and 63 kg). Fabric was ok, i thought it was going to be warm but it's a little tick so you can use it for spring days."
2.0,"Wore these once. The colors are nice and the cloth is good quality. However there is no pouch in the front whatsoever. Nowhere to put the goods,  so as I wear them eventually my junk falls out the side by my leg.  I can't wear these, I'm throwing them away."
2.0,As soon as I put it on I could her threads popping.  I have adjust it all the time.  It was way to cold to send back and wait for a new one. Probably good for someone with a one size fits all size head.
2.0,"I ordered this belt since which did not specify its waist size. It turned out that is is way too small for my size (I wear 31"" waist pants). This belt would probably fit those who have a 28"" waist size or less. The design of the buckle may not be the most attractive and stylish neither. Some better product description of this product would be helpful for customers."
2.0,"I am sad to say I am disappointed by these little earrings.  They came packaged nicely in a box, nice enough for gift giving maybe a tween? I honestly like the security of the clasp and the color. But the ""embellishments "" and actual size are not quite ""ACTUAL "".  I personally think they are fine for running around doing yard work and such, so I won't return them...but i should have chosen a different pair."
2.0,doesn't fit as expected. if you have med to large boobs don't bother. you will be disappointed.
2.0,I didn't like it-- returned it. Too big and cheap looking and strap didn't stay on my shoulder
2.0,"DO READ manufacturers sizing info. It runs true to their sizing, which is substantially smaller than UK or US sizing. In US  I would wear a L in this romper and the 2x fits me. Also, it isn't for tall people. I am 5' and the shorts are right at fingertip length.<br />The 4 stars are because I had to send the first rompers back because of a defect in the seam.<br />Edit: the second romper is splitting up the outside thigh seam. I want to love this, but the quality just isn't there. The second one didn't come defective, but after 1 hand wash and 2 easy use wears, it is breaking down as well."
2.0,"These goggles do not keep a seal, they are cheap and poorly made. I ordered them because I thought they were like similar goggles I had ordered in the past that were also incredibly inexpensive, but those goggles kept a seal! These just leak, despite my best efforts, they fit well, though they suction to my face harshly."
2.0,Fit was good and the fabric feels nice and soft but not warm at all.
2.0,"I bought these pajamas because they were described as ""cotton"".  Product was titled ""PajamaGram Soft Flannel Pajamas Women - Button Front Cotton Pajamas Women"".  When I received the pajamas, I tried them on.  They had a soft feel to them and the size large fit my 5'6"" - 180 lb. body.  But the fabric did not feel like cotton.  Upon further inspection, I found that the material was rayon and polyester.  I felt that these were very expensive ($68) pajamas made completely of synthetic material and would not hold up and wash well like cotton.  I returned them."
2.0,"While I do like the look of these sunglasses, not what I ordered. The lenses are NOT orange which was the primary reason I ordered. Found I do like the style but glasses feel flimsy and barely sit on your ears. Not great in quality and not as advertised. They were cheap enough that I'm not overtly upset but this is yet another reason why I think I need to stop buying so much online - what you see if often not what you get!"
2.0,"Bit disappointed with this top. Cheap t shirt material, it is thin and hangs. Over priced sadly. Will donate it."
2.0,Flimsy. Cheap construction. It falls apart easily.
2.0,I love the shoes but the strap broke after wearing them the first day.
2.0,Horse to big. Not plush enough. Price was great.
2.0,"The coloring is bright (just like the picture). I got the lime-colored (green) one, which may be unflattering for some skin tones (it's not great for mine).<br /><br />The sizing was weirdly small. I even ordered a size up, just to be safe, thinking that it would be pretty loose. In the picture, it looks like there is quite a bit of droop and some nice swooshing of voluminous fabric going on. What I actually got was a shirt that fits like a normal (fitted / tight / body con) shirt. For example, it might be a little snug on me if I were to wear even a thin tank top under it. I guess what I'm saying here is that what I received did not match what I expected to receive in terms of fit based on the photo.<br /><br />Also, it is worth noting that the shirt had a bad smell when I opened it (not like BO, more like a factory but not in a good way); I wash everything I buy before I wear it, so I’m not concerned, but I wanted to let it be known as some people are more sensitive to smells, or have more sensitive skin, than I do."
2.0,Too small i like the style but the too small
2.0,"The shoes are just like the pictures, However the shoes do run small or my daughter feet got bigger over night but I will buy new ones I love them to bad they are too small."
2.0,Es muy bonito pero enseguida para ponermelo see rompió
2.0,Was not what I was expecting. Not the right type of bag for me.
2.0,"I bought these yoga pants because of the reviews. Honestly, they are terrible. The fabric is rough and cheap feeling. Pulling them from the bag I realized two things this company said four way stretch? MAKE THEM STRETCH FAR. These were and large and by the sizing chart that should be conservative for my measurements…these could have fit a child. No thank you. Immediately returned."
2.0,HUGE! SHOULD BE A PAPER WEIGHT!
2.0,Decent but would not buy again.
2.0,"Purchased this dress and was so let down. It arrived pre-worn, smelling like detergent and perfume, with stains and rips. So sad I was looking forward to this style of dress. Returning."
2.0,"I am 5'4"", 145 lbs with an apple shape, and typically wear a 14 or large. I read the reviews and someone suggested to size up so I did and ordered XL, they were too big so I gave them to my daughter who wears XXL and they fit her fine.<br /><br />Her only complaint, and I think it's a rather important one, is that the black dye has stained her skin. I do not recommend these leggings."
2.0,"I must have a defective unit because I cannot calibrate it, even though &#34;Easy Calibration&#34; is professed."
2.0,"These are sooo cute, but unfortunaly they will not stay on my feet. They are so wide my foot slips around and so short they fall off the end. THe result being I can't walk in them without them falling off. Very uncomfortable. Honestly I have not idea who they would fit as I have short wide feet as it is..."
2.0,"I received these a while ago I did not know what to make of it the headbands are ok good quality that's why I gave it 2 stars but since they are sending everyone the wrong item I don't think that's ok since it's a waste of our time you are ordering the correct item number just the picture is wrong on this site I don't really like to make bad reviews it rubs me the wrong way but I have to be completely honest with this item don't. This seller has a lot of great items and I have purchased before from them they have all been good great quality as pictured and everything, now these are where something is wrong the main picture needs to be updated to what we they really send out for this item so it's good to always read the reviews before buying my mistake I did not but yes this is my honest opinion , I did receive this at a discount for my honest and unbiased opinion so here you go.<br /><br />Thank you for your time it is greatly appreciated ! If I was helpful please click YES! Below but for real please lol,<br /><br />Jetzali"
2.0,it broke as soon as i got it i never even wore it.poor quality.
2.0,"Really small, if you are a size 10 these will not fit you"
2.0,"This robe is very beautiful and fits well, however, it is much too heavy to be comfortable. This is why I have returned it."
2.0,returned. nice design but poor fit way to small
2.0,Cheap quality for the price
2.0,Tarnished a week after we got them. Ive cleaned it and nothing. Not happy
2.0,Runs large and too thin.
2.0,This is no where near close to fit but the print and fabric are wonderful.
2.0,This dress is beautiful in general.  The burgundy color is my favorite and actually was on sale when I ordered. However upon inspection In sun light I noticed discoloration on back side of dress. I don’t know if it is fabric coloring flaw or it is a used/ worn dress. It is two big spots hard to ignore.  Sadly returning it.
2.0,I am disappointed with the fabric used for this suit. I regret buying it
2.0,I'm no where near a 5x and It fit like a XL. But it is still a pretty  blouse.
2.0,Came unstrapped while riding.
2.0,"I really like these. They are just the right size for me, and they match my vintage wedding ring and necklace very well ! They are comfortable enough to keep in and sleep in, there's no post on the back sticking out, so you almost don't even know they are there. The shape is great too, they aren't circle but rather just shaped to hug your ear lobe.<br /><br />Only one downside is you just have to be careful with them, the clasp isn't super strong so I've accidentally knocked one out wrapping my head in towel or brushing my hair and since they are so small they could easily just get lost , you won't even hear em hit the ground.<br /><br />Update : 4 days later they are lost, I'm really upset."
2.0,"Although I love it, it’s hard to breathe with it on"
2.0,"Product is super small, need almost two sizes up"
2.0,very poor quality. returned it.  looked nothing like the photo
2.0,"Material was too heave for me, but I liked the pattern."
2.0,This item was Small & very thin<br />It definitely will not make through a wash cycle.<br />Looks as if it’ll be hand wash only.
2.0,This kimono looks better on Amazon than it truly is! Not as silky as I expected like some others I wear. Kind of cheap fabric used and rough feeling. Worth maybe $2.00. Will donate to Goodwill.
2.0,Order up. Runs small. The wedding I bought this dress for is next month. And I’ve tried to reach out about it being too small and I’ve yet to receive a Message back or help at that.
2.0,The shirt is not an off the shoulder shirt. It fit like a plain tshirt. It was too big very Disappointed!!
2.0,This cover up is not something I would wear in public.  Go for home use only lol
2.0,"Nice quality, but only two stars because it is NOT FLEECED LINED! Only reason i purchased so i returned it."
2.0,"These were so adorable that I initially decided to keep them even though they were a little too big for my 6 year-old daughter to wear immediately (she is currently wearing a size 1 and I had ordered a 1.5). However, the second time my daughter tried them on (to see if they fit well enough to wear) the end of one of the buckle straps broke open, exposing the inside of the strap. These shoes were too expensive for me to keep if they were already falling apart prior to being worn. We were both really disappointed."
2.0,"The top fits great, the elastic on the bottoms is awful. It twists and doesn't stay flat.<br /><br />I just wear the top with jeans now, I threw the bottoms away."
2.0,"I reported this to Amazon as an incorrect ""product information"" that misrepresents what was purchased.  Because this was ""fulfilled by Amazon"", I do blame them to a certain degree. The bag I received (as you can see by my pictures) has matte straps, a faux leather name plate, and a white tag (not green).<br />The quality is decent, so I'm going to keep it, but based on the fact that it has a white tag, and has a faux leather name plate (instead of metal) which is stitched down instead of tacked down, and has an unfamiliar pattern on the interior I believe this was probably made for the outlet store.<br />I know Amazon has had problems in the past selling counterfeit VB, as this one could be as well, but for now I'm going to assume it's a Vera factory store product.<br />I do not appreciate the deceptive listing though, and wouldn't buy from this seller again."
2.0,Knacky Reusable Unisex Lumberjack Plaid Face Mask with Adjustable Ear Loops Cotton Washable Christmas Face Cover 4 Piece Set in a Bag Xmas 3D Cloth Mouth Mask Protective Guard for Men Women<br />Fits poorly. Doesn't seal well around nose
2.0,"Other reviewers weren't kidding when they said this is small! The pendant is too dainty and the chain is super thin. Not what I was looking for at all, but you get what you pay for."
2.0,Mask is not breatheable.
2.0,Much bigger than expected. Cannot leave in all the time or will rust.
2.0,cute but tight in the bust area. i had to return it
2.0,Bands have a nice design but the Gotcha device keeps falling out and doesn’t stay in the band. It fell out several times one the first day which makes this item useless.
2.0,I like the material of the dress and it arrived on time but it is a lot shorter than expected and the fold around the chest was crumpled so the stitching didn’t lay flat. After trying on the pattern wasn’t my style but the dress was cute non the less. But again it was supposed to be maxi and came just below my knee.
2.0,My kindergartener wore these shoes to school for 4 days and they look as though he's been wearing them all year. Would work great for a single occasion.
2.0,"Ordered a size 13. Didn't fit my feet, too small. Had to order another similar looking sandal from another company and it fits perfectly."
2.0,"Just plain ol poor quality leather band. The metal center piece is great. However, the band is flimsy with poor construction. The very first time I tried to take it off, one of the button snaps came off with it. ... This is a big dissapointment to me. I am now actively seeking a larger more sturdy leather band to some how try and adhere the awesome metal center piece to. Bummer yo!"
2.0,Distortion made view appear like fish eye lens
2.0,"Beautiful suit, runs very small, they did not offer good customer service"
2.0,sizing was way off.
2.0,All of my clothes get snagged in the zipper.
2.0,I returned it because it was too small.
2.0,"This hat fits like a skull cap. Maybe it might fit properly on a child, not an adult."
2.0,"Nice feeling fabric, but 100% cotton. The sweatshirt runs EXTREMELY small and fitted, so u might want to go up 2 sizes for a decent fit. I’m in the process of hopefully returning it or exchanging for larger size . AND it came from China so it took long to arrive!"
2.0,"Crappy! None of the colors pictured! Mostly lavenders and purples, do not like this. Price was good . Will give it to a friend."
2.0,"I love the way this looked but the clasp broke so easily, the company was prompt in sending me a replacement, however, the clasp broke on that one as well. I did get a refund but thought I'd make everyone aware."
2.0,lost the metal pin after a week
2.0,I thought this would have a fuzzy fleece lining like in the photo. It does not. Very dissappointed.
2.0,That are too short for comfort.
2.0,"Fit is okay, I usualy wear W 6-7, and ordered a YXL. Quality is much below my expectation. The socks pill horribly right after the first wash. The inside thread are too loosely woven (?) together, so if you have any little split or uneven parts in your nails, expect a struggle to get them on. Worst thing, they slide off my feet like crazy. Quite disappointed."
2.0,I thought it looked really cheap and the gold overlay looked to be coming off. I have some pics that I'll add as soon as I get a chance.
2.0,It was nice to wear but was tarnished before the end of the night.  Cute necklace but cheaply made
2.0,Cute but broke the second day I had it on....
2.0,The back of these earnings are off center and a weird length so the “droop” from the ear.
2.0,My daughter loved these shoes and they worked great. She wears them only occasionally when she wants to be fancy. Unfortunately the button fell off after only 4 months so it’s no longer functional 😢 She’s really disappointed.
2.0,"Be more prepared then I was, you only get one! Not a pair"
2.0,I like the product but when I got it they were too small for me so I gave them to my mom.
2.0,the pants are not as long as they appear to be from the picture. they were really to short.
2.0,It wasn't placed on my face well
2.0,"This little key fob protector is very cheaply made and really doesn't do the job.  My Nissan Pathfinder key fob fits inside with way too much room to spare, consequently, it moves all around inside the zippered pocket.  The outer plastic &#34;window&#34; that is supposed to allow me to use the key fob, is cloudy, not clear and I can't see the buttons on the key fob at all, making it useless.  The back zippered compartment has this very cheap longish chain, to which I am apparently supposed to attach a spare key or two.  It would make more sense to have three stationary key rings at the top of the compartment.  This key fob is not well thought out and is not functional.  I won't send it back but I won't use it either.  Don't waste your money."
2.0,Why is this necklace so damn huge?! They put the measurements in cm so you don't think about it. I would look insane walking around with this on!
2.0,Had for about w weeks and bracelet rope broke.  Neckolace has had to be retied twice.  Cute but you get what youbpay for
2.0,Did not like the quality of the hats. The fedora was smashed
2.0,These were too large and uncomfortable for me. I ended up returning them.
2.0,"I loved the way it looked, but the neck line was all crooked and I ultimately could not wear it!"
2.0,They don't look like the pic
2.0,"not the biggest fan of this suit, the mid section is kind of short, and i would not describe myself as having a long torso. Overall, weird fitting."
2.0,"Overall looked good but ring came damaged and I had No time ro return, had to give gift without ring 😓"
2.0,OK but much too large. I wear a 11 wide  so I ordered a 10.5 in the Norocos and they are 1 1/2 inch too long. Quality seems OK
2.0,Very small and sheer.
2.0,"I purchased for a wedding after all the reviews and researched my size.  It showed up and the color is great, however it stunk like plastic/chemically.  I am 5'9&#34;, 145 lbs (size 10) and it looked horrible on me.  The top was way baggy and the bottom was not flattering even with spanx on.  I was hoping this would work for a wedding but alas it is being returned"
2.0,The actual necklace set looks differently than the picture. The gold appears very fake which makes a potentially nice set look cheap.
2.0,"I thought these pants would be regular sweatpants but were thin cotton. Also needed the next smaller size. I was disappointed. I need warm sweatpants. The pictures didn't show that the garments were not what they were labeled,  or at least one wasn't.<br />I appreciated the easy return,  however."
2.0,"The elastic is too soft and stretchy--not enough tension.  If you need just an extra inch, it's hard to get that fine an adjustment.  If you need three inches, it would probably be OK."
2.0,"They are tiny.  I am hoping they fit my mother, otherwise I'll have to return them.  I ordered the Med size, but they are wee."
2.0,Not even close to the dimensions stated. Measures closer to 4.5&#34; x 7.5&#34; x 1.5&#34;
2.0,"Cheap. Will wear as a swim cover up and nothing else, nice material but the print is really tacky.<br /><br />**I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review**"
2.0,It didn't work long at all the wires weren't really done good or something idk when we got it it worked and than when we got it out to go trick or treating we turned it on and than not died so that was a bummer my son was pretty upset maybe I just got a bad one idk
2.0,The slippers are ok but they look thicker than they are.  A cool or cold floor goes through the bottom of the slipper and so they are not very warm. Actually socks are warmer but would be great for the hospital or to wear in the summer. I would not buy them again.
2.0,"I was so excited for this bag.  But ugh.  It's tiny, almost play size.  The handles are cheap and won't last a week of use.  I will be giving this to my daughter."
2.0,"Quality is very poor - you can see through the fuzz to the mesh underneath on the sleeves, fuzz falls off very easily. The jacket cake vacuum sealed so it was all matted down and didn’t really regain any fluff."
2.0,If you have a small midsection it will be big in the cut-out on the stomach. It was also a but see through.
2.0,They are very pretty but make ur eat hurt
2.0,"I bought this dress to get married in, and I really liked it at the time. It fit as expected after reading everyone else's comments.<br /><br />After my wedding, however, I realized that the pattern of the green dress really looked like some of your grandma's drapes. It wasn't very flattering. It's kind of shiny, and it hugged my arms weird, making them look fatter than they really are. You can see in the pictures that it is loose in the chest area above my boobs, and in the back just behind my arms, it does the same thing.<br /><br />Just order a different dress. It's not worth the money. You will look like you're wearing curtains, and you'll be sad that you chose to wear it for an event you'll remember for the rest of your life."
2.0,Nice design and fabric for summer
2.0,It fits great to bad they didn’t send the clips to hold the overalls up
2.0,TOO TIGHT AROUND THE BOTTOM
2.0,Little tight and seam came loose on 1 pair first time out
2.0,"To be honest it looks like a boys shirt and cut very square, not very flattering on my body type."
2.0,This style is quite ugly in person. The closure is awkward. We love Keens but these were a return.
2.0,"The t-shirts are NOT true to size.  I gained weight during COVID, but not that much.  Size it up unles you enough the stuff sausage look, if so, stick to your normal size. Otherwise, size it up.  Good Luck!"
2.0,"It fits small, I usually wear a small to a medium, I should've bought a large or xl large,  But then it would of been too big in the neck and shoulders. Wish my kids would've not thrown the packaging away. I would've returned it."
2.0,"Adorable purse, and bigger than I was expecting. I recently got a job at a veterinary clinic so this was a little reward to myself. However, after just a few uses the strap snapped :( all I had in it was my wallet and keys, no excessive weight. Love the look of this purse just with it was a little higher quality."
2.0,"This shirt was ok.... i sent it back, bc it was super bulky and not flattering at all. I am highly disappointed."
2.0,The actual watch itself is nice.  The band however turned my arm black after wearing it ony once.  Will definitely not but this again.
2.0,very wrinkly
2.0,It's a children's size not for adults or teens
2.0,"Isn't standing up to being a quality product.Not pure sterling silver.the products color changes, and tarnishes too<br />Not satisfied, would like full refund.thank you"
2.0,The black onyx looking center fell out within a week
2.0,Loved the design but I wear an XL in American sizes so I ordered this top in 3x and it fits like a US Medium... Only buy this top if your skinny with a small chest
2.0,"Some pics at different angles would be nice.<br />It is mirrored on 3 sides.<br />Think aluminum foil, how it has a shiny and not shiny side... The not shiny side is what you see and the shiny side is what gives the cube it's sparkle. It's 2 of the flat sides and one of the ends, so 50% of the time you will likely be seeing the not shiny foil...<br />My 5yo picked this out, so I think it will be fine... but I definitely wouldn't gift this to a teen/adult. She picked out the ""rainbow"" color and the foil has an iridescent-ness to it, so it might not be that obvious.<br />If I didn't commit to getting it for her already, I'd probably return it."
2.0,"Listen to the reviews about threading & thinness.  Bought due to speedy delivery, but wish I’d waited 8/10 have major threads and or missed stitching which makes the bandana torn.<br />  Not worth the price or fast delivery for the quality of product!"
2.0,"I loved the material and the look of this sweater. I just wish it had actually fit. I ordered a large but it was tight enough to feel like a S/M. The sleeves were too long. The cuffs extended way past my fingertips. I would have to shove them up my arms for a comfortable fit and that’s not what I’m looking for. I’d consider exchanging for a larger size but the sleeves would be just as long, if not longer.  I ordered 4 sweaters from this line of clothing and all four had the same issues. As much as they are beautiful, I’ll have to return them."
2.0,"I like this idea, but just fits .... wierd. I have other shrugs, I thought this one would work well, but just doesn't fit right. I think it's a little too big but can't really tell."
2.0,Product dulled and finish was not good quality. Disappointed in this purchase! Don't buy if u expect a quality product.
2.0,"The material is too coarse and it actually was itchy, plus the back straps require someone else to dress you so if you are by yourself, you can’t get the dress on. It’s also too long.<br />Returning for poor material and design."
2.0,"ordered 2x and can hardly get them on, nowhere on the gloves does it state the size. i'm sure they are a medium."
2.0,Kind of small and cheap material look else where.
2.0,"I measured my wrist before ordering this.  It measured 6"".  The bracelet was way too big for me - a gap of around 3/4 "" which made the bracelet roll around all the time."
2.0,The dress is not as flowy as the picture or as long as shown on the model.  The material felt like flimsy swimsuit material and not the sheer flowy fabric in the picture.  I returned my item.
2.0,"I changed my star review, I stll cannot say how they hold up but the company does giveaways.  The first one I got they honored, I got my shirt for free and they sent me a gift card, so I ordered another one.  This time I got a buy one get one free.  This time they said since I got the other giveaway I cannot get this one?  Which is not right, no where does it state limit of the giveaways to one customer and they wont respondd to my emails.  Not ok and not great customer service.  I attached pictures to show the color, cut and length of the shirt.  As you can see the color is slightly different from the one shown online (as screens can change color a bit). It is so soft and comfy, I am 5'9 about 180lbs 38C and have a belly so I ordered an xl, going off reviews on running small.  That is does, according to the chart an xl fits a bust of 44, uh no.  It is not swimming on me, it has a little wiggle room, not tight, goes past my tush (which shirts that long are hard to find when you are tall) and does not hug my rolls either.  The V neck is also long so I would say if you want it to cut lower order up a size or more.  The pocket is a cute lilttle touch, to me this would be more of a spring/fall shirt.  I wore it on a slightly warm day and I was hot so, I could imagine how it would be on a full fledged summer day. In description it says there is cotton, I took a pic of tag and nowhere does it say cotton.  These shirts are not worth wjat they charge for and they are boxy.  Hope this helps 😁"
2.0,the back is unusually longer than the front. hoping i can get it altered because the sleeves are cute
2.0,Nice wallet but if you are looking to buy for the scan protection Dont. I scan through it every day to get into different rooms at work.
2.0,"We tried to make sure we took this off for bath time, but only took once for the water to get into the watch. Would not recommend if water activities are involved."
2.0,"These bras look great and seem well made; however, the back strap feels like tiny needles on my skin. Maybe I'm sensitive but I couldn't wait to take it off. I've always worn a 34 C but I think these run small. Maybe a bigger size wouldn't cause such pain."
2.0,Supposed to be a leather cord. It was a cheap shoestring with a plastic sleeve over it.
2.0,"Looks like the picture, super cute. Actually, I would have loved this outfit except for the fact it is WAY too big, I bought the 0-3 months size and this outfit is closer to a 3-6M/6M size. The pants aren't much wider than a 0-3 but are at least 3 inches longer than a Gerber 0-3. The onesie swallowed my 2 month old bub, who currently wears 0-3M in Gerber and 3M in Carters brand. Currently working on returning this outfit and hoping the carters 1st xmas outfit I ordered will be here in time for our first family xmas pictures."
2.0,Pics aren't accurate
2.0,I like this Pendant and im definitely giving it as a Gift but i dont know why this Seller put my Phone number and a description of whats in the Package and how much it costs on the outside of the Package.
2.0,"The glasses were warped right out of the packaging and no matter how I tried to straighten it, I couldn't get it right. The lenses are uneven and give me a headache when trying to read because the magnifying areas fall at different angles. They are lightweight but are distorted and not sturdy."
2.0,"Bought this for my teen son. I was a bit disappointed.  It wasn't as nice as I expected. The basketball flap was a screenprint/fabric picture, not leather, flat not textured as I expected. When they put my son's name on they started the first letter on the left edge where the stitching is (much further to the edge than the picture shows) We got the size S, which had several credit card slots, license slot, money pocket and extra slots. It was OK for $16, but not as nice as the picture made it look. I give it 2.5/5 dec2017<br />Update - my teen son didn't like it at all. Too cheap looking for him I think."
2.0,Ordered a 3XL and it fits like a large. Will be a cute shirt on my daughter. Too bad it didn't fit me!
2.0,"I thought I was getting sterling silver ankle bracelets, although they're all very cute and I still wear them they look pretty cheap and fragile. If I knew thy were going to look that way I wouldn't have bought then buuuuut! for the price and the amount of anklets that come in the package, they are still cute especially for the summer"
2.0,"These shoes are comfortable enough and super lightweight. They are a great camp shoe for when you're hiking and want to remove your boots in camp.<br /><br />However, the fit is a bit weird. I normally wear a M10.5 or M11. For these I had to get a M12. The fit is just ok - they are still a bit too short and by big toe feels a bit like it is being jammed against the front of the shoe. I am hoping they stretch out a bit.<br /><br />Also, they originally sent me the wrong color and I had to return it. They thankfully reimbursed me for the shipping but then the owner complained that I should've sent it via USPS as that is cheaper. Dude! Maybe if you weren't such a penny pincher you would've hired someone to send me the correct item in the first place!"
2.0,"This necklace loks just as pictured, except the &#34;stones&#34; are not shaped, they are just rounded. Also, though I understand it is a statement necklace, this thing is MASSIVE. I haven't been able to wear it because it is just so clunky. Perhaps on a larger frame it balances out, but this thing doesn;t suit my body."
2.0,It's a bit big all over. But the breast spots are very close together with little support. I wouldn't suggest this bathing suit.
2.0,they fog a lot
2.0,"I got these slippers 5 days ago.  Put the slippers on as usual and my foot was sticking through the right side of the right slipper. I don't just mean a small hole, the entire upper is torn away fromt he sole. It looks like the slipper is actually made from thin card-board. just asked Amazon for my money back."
2.0,The top fit perfectly and was very flattering. The bottom was too small.
2.0,"My mechanics glove was wearing out and soaked in grease so I got these hoping to replace the old pair.  The gloves are thick and big wore bigger than the medium size I got.  Latex grips well, maybe too well.  My fingers were getting stuck together to each other, and to the part I was working on.  In the end, I had to take the glove off to complete the work because my fingers and palm were sticking to everything and I could not turn the wrench any more.  Maybe with use the stickiness will go away but I am going to find something else to use when working on my car.  I can see using these gloves maybe to change the tires or working on something that does not require dexterity but for working with wrenches and smaller parts, this probably will not be my first choice.  I received this in exchange for my honest and unbiased review."
2.0,This bra does what it’s supposed to but it’s uncomfortable and itchy. It’s also so hard to button back up after nursing because the buckle is so high on your shoulder it’s difficult to pull the bra cup back up one handed while holding your baby.
2.0,This runs somewhat small. I bought M assuming I would normally wear a small but it's still too small. Material is very thin. I would not describe this as a &#34;compression&#34; top.
2.0,The material is slick and doesn’t give at all. They also run very small. I’m 5’2” and it was just over my knees.
2.0,Super cute came with a snag
2.0,Super small!  I ordered an XL and it looks like a small.  I had to return.  I love the design though.
2.0,I would not by these again. some of the socks fit great and others where to tight! It didnt take to long to blow my toe through three or four of them.
2.0,"I like the sheer silk part, but the are to tight on the ankle"
2.0,"Very cool design but the wrist part is wayyyy too small, more like what a child would wear."
2.0,"I normally wear a size 7 shoe, I ordered size 8, they were much too small. Couldn't even get my foot all the way in. Big disappointment."
2.0,"I didn't expect them to fit perfectly due to the fact that I am on the thicker side, but I did not expect them to be COMPLETELY SEE-THROUGH. And on top of that, the waist is the same size all around, so it does not give enough room for the butt. I'd rather spend more money and get quality ones."
2.0,"I thought I liked this at first so I kept it. But after my first wear, I realized it’s a donation item. Difficult to wear due to buttons in front. I was tugging on it and uncomfortable all day."
2.0,Shirt is really tight not what I was expecting for my size. Otherwise the Material is soft and very good quality. Wish this shirt fit better as I love it.
2.0,The green hair is going to go everywhere. I should have listened to the other reviews but I figured it was just $12 so what the heck. Should have spent the money on a bowl of vietnamese soup instead. Yum!
2.0,"pretty, but runs very small - had to give to my daughter!"
2.0,The description says navy blue and black. The dress that was sent to me was navy blue and green. I was expecting navy blue and black. On the other hand it is a nice dress.
2.0,Lower quality for its price.
2.0,It's cute but one of the chains popped off one week later!! I don't wear it
2.0,Leggings look how they are supposed to look but they fit so stiff and hardly have any stretch to them
2.0,"Didn’t come with the doll robe, only child’s robe. Amazon refunded"
2.0,It's not to wear outside I will jut wear inside my house.
2.0,This dress felt like a swimsuit and kept rising up. I ended up trying it with leggings and still wasn't a fan. I love the print but wasn't comfortable wearing this so I ended up returning it. For $20 I expected better quality.
2.0,These earrings are not worth the money. They are ill made and cheap looking.
2.0,Whatever is on the gloves that is for gripping immediately fell off once it got a little wet. I wouldn't purchase again.
2.0,No worth it
2.0,These are not long as advertised.  They offer no compression support either.  Baggy and loose.
2.0,Shirt doesn't look like picture
2.0,"The Dress is so cute. So I was so disappointed. Fit very oddly on my body. Looked horrible on my chest. Otherwise it was good. My sister (very different body type) tried it as well. Still fit poorly. So much potential. I’m 5’6”, medium, size 8. Medium dress. I don’t think a Smaller or bigger size would have helped."
2.0,"The army green color is really more like grass green. Other than that, the dress is OK, like the description. I returnes because of the mismatch color."
2.0,Fabric is rather stiff so it doesn’t have a flowy look. More like a petticoat.
2.0,I am disappointed in this because it doesn't stay hooked. It keeps coming unclamped.
2.0,This was not the quality I was expecting it fit a little snug -
2.0,To small don’t hold much it good
2.0,Not worth it. Each pair was cut differently
2.0,Shirt took a long time to come and is cheaply made
2.0,Bought this watch for my friends birthday and it broke a month after will not buy again
2.0,"The sweater itself is ok, its a flat thin knit, but it doesn't look like the pictures.  the pictures show a large design with a raised pattern.  The actual sweater has a pattern that is about half the size and has a flat knit.  The video shows what the sweater actually looks like."
2.0,"How can you have a golf dress with no side pockets? It's cute and the fabric seems comfortable and breathable, but it doesn't work for me.  Maybe it would work for a really good golfer who doesn't need to carry extra balls in her pocket!"
2.0,Looks significantly nicer in the picture.
2.0,It was only 6 pairs of gloves. Not a great deal for the price. The picture on the ad shows 8 or 9 pairs.
2.0,logo is in the way
2.0,"I’m giving this hat a two star rating because the fit is nothing like other women’s hats from the same company.  TrailHeads, PLEASE make this hat exactly like your other hats, I LOVE the cute design on the sides, but the folding brim, and large size makes for a sloppy looking hat.  I would also love to see some neutral colors to choose from (khaki, green, off white, etc.). I would buy them all!"
2.0,"small,  defects"
2.0,"Darker color and more ""youthful""  than I needed. My mistake. Lovely top in all ways."
2.0,It was difficult to install my watch on and came without any instructions. It should have come with additional pins.
2.0,"I was pretty happy with the item, but it didn't last very long. The clasp broke after a month or so of irregular use."
2.0,"These leggings were not squat proof at all. I am extremely disappointed because I was looking for a pair of seamless leggings for the gym. I'm 5'1 and 140 pounds. I have bulked up a bit, so I have muscle and that muscle makes buying leggings difficult. Boiled down, these are almost too tight, and see-through. I bought the ones with the white on the butt, so that could be why. I am still going to wear them out and about, but they can't be used to workout in. A large might've fit better, but then they would've been too long. I recommend ordering a size up if you're not sure. I do think they are good quality. I wouldn't call them squat-proof though."
2.0,"The size fits well, but the collar opening is too big for me."
2.0,"Very pretty swimdress. When I received it one of the straps was broken. Seller reassured me it would be replaced but failed to do so. Unfortunately that is why I had to change my review from five stars. I was writing it as is the strap was fixed. Since it is not going to be addressed at all, this was my only choice. It is very pretty and does provide ample covered. Aside from the strap being broken, it appears to be well made. It is unfortunate because I was looking forward to owning this. Had to return."
2.0,"I was really disappointed when i opened the package, The immediate smell of mold had hit me, and I thought it was just because of the rain. But when i pulled out the costume to wear, I noticed mold spores growing all over the shorts of the cosplay."
2.0,"Top was a little big, bottoms a little small.  Top doesn't give much support either."
2.0,They are way too tight around the waist.  White looks like underwear
2.0,"Well, they are cute for fun and maybe a 70's party, but they don't actually function as sunglasses.  The mirroring makes it very distracting to look out of when it is sunny outside and I'm not sure there is ANY UV protection.  I find myself squinting when I wear them outside and I get a weird mirror glare effect, which I assume is from the mirroring.  I wouldn't buy them for actual sun protection, but they are totally cute for a themed party."
2.0,printing on the stripes was off making them appear crooked.  returned because AC customer service acknowledged flawed.
2.0,"I bought these a while ago and I still haven't tried them on because they had a horrid smell to them, so I had to put them aside.  FYI."
2.0,These blouses fit like a gunny sack. I returned them.
2.0,"Dude, don't listen to anyone else on here tell you this is a good dress for short people. I got excited because it's so hard to find maxi's @ 5'3&#34;.... read someone say it worked well for them at the same height... i ordered a small & this dress is like 6&#34; too long! Awfully disappointing."
2.0,"This was super cute on the model so I looked at the size chart and ordered accordingly. When it arrives, I could tell I should have sized up. The suit is small! The crotch-chest length was just too short and was maxed out in stretch. I have a 34DD chest and there was little support, even with as tight as the suit was. There was ""slippage"" of my girls into the waist stripes so I would say busty girls beware. If you do order and try it out, make sure not to drop anything because you'll def have a JJ moment when one of the girls comes out. Cute but not for me."
2.0,I just got my swim suit and it's an XL which is suppose to be a 16/18 I wear a 10 in jeans and have a c cup so I should've been able to order the M or L but I ordered bigger and it's way to small the top would fit a B or smaller and the bottoms look like a size small. I'm not happy with the produce
2.0,"I got two different shirts with issues.<br />On one shirt, one side of the collar was shorter, and it laid way too weird. Otherwise, fit well.<br />The other shirt was tagged as a small, but fit like an extra large. The shoulder seam was 2 inches over my shoulder.<br />All I can say is... WTH!?! I give up.<br />Good luck to you, if you order this shirt. You never know what you'll get."
2.0,It’s just mediocre. More of a royal blue than navy …
2.0,I took a chance but the other reviews were right. They cover way less of the foot than pictured.
2.0,So what I got and what the picture shows are two very different things. First off the ones I received have no pockets and the picture shows pockets so very misleading. the fabric is very thin and could easily be seen thru. the fit is much smaller than expected. The length of these are very short like a capri. They however are very comfortable.
2.0,Not true to size. They were at least 2 sizes to small.
2.0,Looks like a giant moomoo shirt
2.0,Not a comfortable dress
2.0,Does not look anything like the photo. It’s more of a shirt then a jacket.
2.0,Smaller than expected and cheap material..cute design..i guess in this case you get what you Pay for.
2.0,"These worked perfectly for the first day, but then began cutting into my lips. The plastic on the end is incredibly sharp, and made my lips swell until the plastic cut even deeper into my skin. Don't wear these anywhere you have a lot of movement, as they will did in to your skin.<br /><br />Positive: they stay in super well and the fit of the stud is pretty tight."
2.0,"These used to be great- obviously bought out or changed who/how made. Garbage now- very disappointed.<br />I had 8 pairs that finally started wearing out after a few years so eagerly ordered their replacements. Smaller, poor materials, totally different waistband. Not worth buying at ANY price. Sad decline of a formerly great product. Steer clear!"
2.0,Dislike. Easy to be broken.
2.0,Washed one time and (did not put in the dryer) in a washer without a agitator and they fell apart. Made with very thin materials still got sunburn.
2.0,The bracelet was very Pretty. However the prongs bent every time I put a shirt on. Catching on everything.
2.0,Too big and falls off of my face. It’s thin but not breathable.
2.0,These keychains sublimated beautifully. My issue with them were the scratches on the back side that were already there right out of the package. I won't be able to sell these.
2.0,"I understand that these are a big savings over the real, honest non-scrapper pins. But they really should tell you they are scrapers and you might feel bad to trade them as real Disney pins! 10 pins were duplicates (2 of each for 5 pins). Some had huge spurs around the edges. The paint was poorly done on some - no shine at all. And many with paint dips. Only 1-2 looked really close to real. These are fine if your child just wants some pins or if you don't mind trading fakes with the cast members - who probably know what you are doing.<br />2 stars for on time shipping and complete order."
2.0,I used this slipper every day.  Lasted about a month and the padding was gone.
2.0,Very thin and not great quality
2.0,Turns green and turned my neck black
2.0,Very poor product quality.  The clasp broke twice within the first 10 min of wear.
2.0,way too heavy
2.0,Not what I was told it was.  Also I'm told it could take up to 21days to refund.  This was a costly gift and I won't get a refund on time to replace.
2.0,"Seems to be made a little on the cheap. Install went OK but once installed regular visor would only come straight down not  tilt towards the windshield. unable to adjust to keep the sun out of your eyes and be able to keep your eyes on the road. The yellow filter worked OK for night driving but being a bit narrow allowed headlight glare to get you on the side of traffic. The dark daytime filter was almost useless except when the sun was past the 10 or 11 o'clock in front of you position. But when the glare came off of windshields, buildings or water it was pretty lame. It's worth I suppose what I paid for it. Knowing what I know now would I buy it again - no."
2.0,"The band is very nice my wife loved it, but the tassel part broke within a month of use."
2.0,Too large and it is see through
2.0,Disappointed. Ordered this according to the measurements and it was still way too small even at a XXXL. I returned it.
2.0,"I liked these a lot at first--until the finish began coming off. I can't even tell that they are &#34;rose gold&#34; anymore, after only 3 or 4 months"
2.0,Small fit like a large
2.0,"For reference I ordered the pink with white stripes in a Large and I am 5’8”, size 8/10 and about 150lbs with small C chest.<br />Good:<br />Nice color, soft feel, cute style and fit. Hit just above knees.<br /><br />Bad:<br />Typical Chinese junk. Thin poly blend fabric. Arrived with hole and other separating seems. Sheer enough you would have to be careful with bra choice and a slip would be a must. Maybe worth half the price paid. Will be returning."
2.0,Way too small to be a large. Cute though.
2.0,This shirt is way too small even the largest size XXL is way too small.
2.0,It's just a paper... Poor Freddie...
2.0,"Bought this for my husband and it's way to small. Beware, not true to size."
2.0,"Got it for my wife's new car, it broke like the other review. We found the pieces and fixed it.  A week later it was misding again.  Frustrating as she doesn't even need to take her keys out to unlock or start the vehicle.  An attempt at being nice is now a frustration.  Don't buy if you plan to use it."
2.0,Very pretty color but the style and shiny fabric was not like the other Charmy dresses I have.  This was matronly and not flattering!
2.0,It is a nice lightweight shirt but runs very small. I usually order a large and did for this shirt and was not comfortable. And the sad thing was it does not come in XL so I couldn't reorder.
2.0,This dress is very boxy and runs quite large
2.0,"If this shirt were made out of a fine cotton,  it would be the perfect shirt.<br />I did not like the plastic like feel of it.....so I sent it back :("
2.0,Ordered it as a gift and to be honest I’m not sure I’m going to keep it I was disappointed in the quality and material of the purse it feels kind of cheap and more like plastic than wicker. The strap is very thin and feels flimsy and also feels overall cheap... not in love with it.
2.0,"Strings get tangled and won't go back together , super annoying"
2.0,Disliked and returned due to fabric. Too much static and wasn’t quality material.
2.0,"The look was really cool if you are looking for a feline effect, but some won't fit on the fingertips. Everyone's body is different and my fiance could not put all of them on her fingertips. I'm not saying not to get this product, but you may risk wasting your money if you do due to improper fitting."
2.0,Stone was very small for the price.
2.0,"This lanyard is pretty but it will not work for my name badge.  The lanyard is crossed before being sewn and it will not lay flat and the clasp is not designed well to hold the badge.  The VB decoration is sewn in with the  clasp and is in the way once the badge is attached; perhaps this is due to the lanyard being sewn twisted.  Overall, pretty, but useless."
2.0,"does not have reinforced stitching and broke after an hour of wearing. I did like that it was double mesh, just wish it had held up."
2.0,"Obviously faux leather. Too wide, looks cheap. Returned."
2.0,Looks nice but very light. Does not feel strong
2.0,I thought they would fit on a chain and they don't.
2.0,"If you want a lightweight sock, you will like these.  However, the seam at the toes is weak.  It appears to be unraveling at the toes.  I would expect this to happen at the big toe area over time, but it is occurring all along the entire toe line in random spots.  I have not had these socks for very long and I have not worn them enough to explain why this is happening other than poor workmanship."
2.0,"comfortable and light, but i bought the white one and you can see straight through it, even with a white bra underneath."
2.0,"I ruined the first pair when I tried to put them on, my fingers went right through the lace panel. There were several pairs in the package and each pair was very easily torn. They're pretty but they dont last."
2.0,was too big on me
2.0,I received the shorts and it was not like picture I looking at. It was not cuff at the legs. they were fringe at the legs and just been stitch. Who ever did the sewing did not do a good job a I was not happy. the button hole was close up. I could have got a pair of jeans an just cut them myself. I was expecting the shorts to look just like that picture at looking at right now. And it did not look any thing like that .
2.0,The color is great but super small and doesn’t fit my 5year old
2.0,"Got sweat lines the first time I wore it. Wouldn’t off cared if they would have washed out, but they didn’t..  This is the second hat that I bought from Nike recently that has done this. I love the quality of the hat but you just have to be okay with staining after a couple wears."
2.0,Too tight around the hips
2.0,Really uncomfortable material. Ripped easy/see through
2.0,La verdad muy bonitas pero tienen un gran defecto cuando uno camina se sueltan son incómodos se safan en fin no se que hacer con ellas la verdad la devolución cuesta de tiempo
2.0,dress to small in sholders. No return label. Very dissapointed.
2.0,Product looked used/refurbished
2.0,"Jeans do not fit to size. I’m 36x30 and ordered 38x30, they were still too tight. They are also like elastic or stretchy jean material so maybe they are form fitting by design but certainly not in a good way."
2.0,"They look well made and lately I've always bought Vionic or Orthaheel which feel great the minute you don them, but not so with these...am trying to give them a chance, but they hurt."
2.0,"Didn’t like quality of fabric, it’s too thin"
2.0,Ended up giving it to my daughter.
2.0,The shirt is smaller than described. I ordered several other shirts in the style from a different manufacturer and they all got great but this one is smaller length wise and does not have a loose fit.
2.0,"This dress is inferiorly made and ill fitting. The neckline is not as depicted and constantly slides off one shoulder, the print is crooked and veers to one side, and the front hem is noticeably higher than the back hem. But I'm keeping it for shlepping around the house. Definitely not good enough to wear out."
2.0,Wig is a lot thinner than pictured and the beads were falling off when I took it out of the bag.
2.0,This is a pretty ring. Loved it until one of the side stones fell out. Guess you get what you pay for.
2.0,"I washed in delicate cycle and one of the straps tore off, before I even got to wear it!"
2.0,I ordered a large. i wear between M/L but was small busted. maybe you should order two sizes up.nice  material.
2.0,"These are really cheap and do not have th shelf bra built in. There's nothing special about them, but I guess to workout they'll do the trick."
2.0,"The fabric was really thin, i got the grey one hoping it wouldnt be see through but it was so i had to return because i wanted them for my wedding pics"
2.0,These get slimy pretty quick. Gross
2.0,Left greenish mark on wrist after I took the bracelet off.
2.0,"The hoop doesnt come around fully around ur nostril. Theres a big gap n its not like u can do anything to fix it or rig it bcuz the gap is on the front of ur nostril where it shows, its not on the inside where u can hide it or squeeze it closed. I didnt like that i wanted something with a full hoop all the way around from inside out n its ashame bcuz if it did it would look really cute having the gem and a hoop."
2.0,Pants are made of almost a nylon material. Needless to say it's see thru. No give it stretch at all. Returned them
2.0,"This shirt was very light weight,  slightly see-through,  and a light lavender in color when i purchased white."
2.0,While I liked the color and material of these shorts and really wanted to like them they were too snug around my 26 week pregnant belly. Normally I like the support around my belly but this was too tight.
2.0,"They are really cute, but they aren't very big. I used the last connecter on it and it was a bit too tight.. measure your neck I guess? Lol."
2.0,Very cheap material. It stretched out before I even left. Material is scratchy
2.0,"It was a good attempt at making these jeans look like the image, but in all honesty, this was false advertisement. They do not look like the jeans in the image even though they tried. They are not high waisted and the material bunches in the crotch from poor pattern. It’s a stretchy material which is nice but not necessarily comfortable. The width of the flare is the only redeeming quality but the delivery of the idea was wasted on cheap materials and resources. They’re getting returned."
2.0,"It's a good idea, but it slips, and the finish quickly came off of the buckle.  Don't waste your money."
2.0,Fits tighter than expected. Not really linen or if it is very low quality.
2.0,This came apart within hours of receiving. she wanted to keep said she would put it on a ribbon.
2.0,Run too small!!!
2.0,"I loved this bag when I initially bought it. It is mostly high quality but the zippers are extremely cheap and broke after just a couple of weeks. The same thing happened to both zippers. The zipper piece will slide, but 99/100 times the zipper will not close. Otherwise good materials and storage. Strap is a little uncomfortable if you have a laptop or heavier item in it because it is not very wide on the shoulder."
2.0,This is made for women's rings.  The wrap-around legs are too short for any men's ring more than 2mm across.
2.0,I am disappointed because the texture looks kind of cheap. Not what I expected like the picture. And the button hole broke easily... :(
2.0,These ended up being too long and uncomfortable. You need to have a very large ear to have these fit right. Very large ear!
2.0,"The cap is way too small  for me. It doesn't feel comfortable...I have to adjust it over and over all day long and the adjustable button on the back hurts my head. Unfortunately i washed it before trying and cant return now. Although it is made well, great quality fabric and doesn't need to be ironed after wash."
2.0,coin purse zipper was broke
2.0,Nice style but the knot on the front makes way too short almost to show your  privates
2.0,"Poor quality, returned product"
2.0,"Great vibrant color assortment however the construction is very poor. You get what you pay for, these “glasses” are not meant to be used more than once. The plastic is very thin and can be easily broken. If I had known they were such poor quality I wouldn’t have ordered them. I ended up ordering another 2 dozen glasses from another seller. I plan on donating these to my daughters school for their treasure box toys."
2.0,"I returned this item because it would not stay up around my face, it constantly fell down unless I would fold it over my ears which was a total pain. I returned for a different item that came with ear loops so I wouldn't have to fidget with it constantly on the motorcycle."
2.0,Not good quality - just use twice and color is already fading.
2.0,Wanted to like it but it was too large and just fit a bit weird.
2.0,Its very cheaply made all you can see is a giant black blob with glowing eyes and what appears to be a a street sign at night I'm assuming it's the ship.
2.0,This is a cute little jacket but the material pilled up after one use.  I think it was from the friction of wearing my purse over my shoulder.  I guess I could use a sweater shaver to fix it but should you have to do that after wearing once?
2.0,Petals fell off during initial wear...<br />I would not have known if bystanders saw on floor....<br />I need another pair for this grief<br />No one purchases broken jewelry...<br />send another!
2.0,biggest size fits only a 4 year old
2.0,Terrible material. Wore once already coming apart.
2.0,"Very cheaply made.  Baglane or Dot & Dot are better made bags.  Spend the extra few dollars on those.  Also, I think these were some promo item or something, as there was advertising on them."
2.0,I received the band on June 15th. It broke on July 26th.
2.0,"color cosmic violet,  size medium.  These are totally SEE THROUGH when you bend over. The color distorts it at times but other times, yep, there it is, all my business. These are more so see through than any other pants i have tried.  Other than that they feel amazing.  I wanted them for yoga so I don't want see through.  But if you getting these for running or the gym and your not going to be bent over i would have given them a 5 star.  I'm 148lb 5'9 and medium fit great.  I have a bigger than normal hip/butt area, fit though. They do make LOVE HANDLES. They fell so good I wish i needed them for something else. see picture for love handles and one picture i stuck my hand down the pants.  If you can zoom you can quite clearly see my finger nail through them at the middle of my leg."
2.0,Not what I wanted. But awesome return experience.
2.0,"These white pants are basically see-through. Long enough and nice shape though. If you’re ordering white, be sure your top covers your tush."
2.0,"These bracelets did not agree with my skin oils, they turned after the second day of wearing them."
2.0,I’m only hoping that it got damaged in the shipment. Was hoping for just a basic case to hold my glasses in overnight but got a case that was smushed and not aligned. I hoped it was just a small fluke and tried to open and bend it back. But this only resulted in a case that had a gap similar to a pistachio nut. Hoping that future orders will be packed a bit more carefully as this was sent in a padded envelope.
2.0,I took more than 45 minutes to do the first hand wash for this new sweater since the water kept to be hot pink for almost half hour. The quality of dyes for this sweater is not good so caused too much color bleeding. Be aware to wash it alone for the first wash since it could affect your entire load of laundry if you put it into machine with other clothes.
2.0,"(Note:  I've tried deleting this duplicate review, which is the same as the first one I submitted 5 days earlier, with no success.  It appears that once my unfavorable review had received a couple of &#34;helpfuls&#34;, the product was re-listed without my review and some other unfavorable ones.  I re-submitted it, and it was re-listed again without my review.  Looks like Amazon caught onto this game the seller was playing, and now both of my reviews have been reinstated, along with the other unfavorable ones.)<br /><br />Have a difficult time rating this dress. Was looking for something simple and long, not too clingy (to hide my many flaws!) to wear to a casual outdoor wedding, and really liked the look, particularly the modest scoop neckline. Ordered a large (I'm 5'-7&#34;, 155 lbs, typically wear a size 14 and a 36C bra.) According to the size chart, a large correlated to my usual dress size (&#34;12-14&#34;), might possibly be a bit big in the top (&#34;38.5-40&#34;), but I've usually found that anything with Spandex (5%) usually fits a little more snugly.<br /><br />When it arrived, initial impression was good - nice and soft feel - until I tried it on. The top was VERY snug, the waist was more right below my bustline versus at the waist (as shown in the photo with the model), and though I loved the flow of the skirt, I would have to be over six feet tall to wear this dress unaltered - even with the highest heels possible! Since the wedding is outdoors with chairs on the lawn, women had been advised to wear flats, and in that case, this dress was going to have to be hemmed a full SIX INCHES (and would still hit the floor!) I remembered being confused by the reviews... a woman my height (5'-7&#34;) said it was @ 1/2&#34; off the ground... a 5'-8&#34; said it reached her ankles... a 5'-9&#34; said it reached the tops of her feet but didn't drag the ground... a 5'-10&#34; said it was too long even with heels --- how could these women all be experiencing such different things? Once on Amazon I'd mistakenly ordered a dress for my granddaughter by an imposter, and I wondered if possibly the same thing had happened here. But there's only one seller, &#34;OLRIK&#34;, and orders are fulfilled by Amazon.<br /><br />Well, I just now looked at the &#34;Certificate of Achievement&#34; on this listing, 5 photos down, and there was the clue as to why there are such discrepancies with what women were experiencing. Here's what it says (complete with misspellings and actual punctuations): &#34;All authentic levaca products sold through AMAZON.com are sold only by the seller OLRIK. Prouducts that sole by other sellers are imitation products similar in design. Please take note. these unauthentic products does not have same quality such as color.tabic. construction and over all design and feel as our products. levaca does not support the quality assurance of these products. Hence. Please check the name of seller before purchasing these products. levaca takes authenticty of product very seriously and will take legal action against all lmitation products and will further take possible action with Amazon.com.&#34; It seems the lack of attention to detail in the &#34;Certificate of Achievement&#34; is reflected in the product itself, which is obviously hit or miss.<br /><br />For 20 bucks, you can always take a chance (like I did) that you get one that fits; if you don't, you can return it (like I am.)<br />Comment"
2.0,WAY too small doesn't even begin to discribe!! Seemed nice enough when I pulled it out of the package but then the XXL that I ordered wouldn't even fit one boob!!! Had to give it to my God daughter who wears a B cup!!! Don't waste your time and money!!!
2.0,too small...<br /><br />Thanks!
2.0,The tee shirt is soft but the appliqué ruins it. I have not worn it!  Too heavy and thick !!
2.0,The back is a very faded pink compared to the front. Cute but so so quality
2.0,Chain broke easily
2.0,Way to small for a man's wrist. He really liked it to.
2.0,I should’ve checked to see what material it was made out of because it turned out to be that super cheap sort of ribbed “club dress” stuff that I absolutely cannot stand.
2.0,I bought them for my girlfriend and it just did not fit her well at all.
2.0,I like this a lot but I wish you could pick a size because when I got the dress it was a size or two bigger than me
2.0,Bottoms were too small but top was perfect. Wish they would have disclosed these run small or sold pieces separately so I can order a different size for each. Bathing suits feel very nice though!
2.0,The material is cotton. I usually wear a small but seems a little tight. The straps at the top are awkward also.
2.0,"The shoes ran a bit small, but good fit once I went up 1/2 size. Great traction for trail running/hiking. My biggest complaint - and it is a showstopper - is the almost total lack of cushion support. My feet and knees hurt after pretty short hikes. I expected much better support out of shoes labeled as for the trail as well as past experience with the brand."
2.0,This product is of poor quality and high price.
2.0,received wallet and proceeded to put cards in slots be careful when you do that because I guess I push down a little too hard in the lining split and I guess they use some kind of glue because every time I will put my car down the line and came out with it
2.0,Jewel fell off before I EVER wore it
2.0,The chain was not that strong. It broke even before i used it.
2.0,"I loved the watch, I work from home, so I like having a simple easy watch but the problem is that the band got so dirty in a matter of just days. I don't know what from, only time I wore it was when I was working, but nothing I did could get it clean unfortunately..  :("
2.0,I disliked that the material it is made from is easily damaged.
2.0,This product does not hold shoulder length thick curly hair.  It also doesn't stay in place while you sleep.  Compared to another I bought the material is thin.  I do not recommend this cap for anyone with longer thick curly hair.
2.0,I'm 6'1 about 240. The XL fit like boxer briefs.
2.0,Quality is not good. Thin and kind of see through.
2.0,It came from SheIn and was so small I was busting out of it. Returning it was also a pain.
2.0,Cheap looking. Returned for one that looked just like it but the whole mask was leather look. The bottom half of this mask is like felt or something.
2.0,Returned but it was cute dress if the stitching was better
2.0,"This is a lovely shirt in the photo, but in person the tye dye was so terrible,the pattern did not line up.<br />One sleeve looked very muddy in the colors with no obvious dark blue stripe, and the other sleeve had dark blue on the shoulder, which was misaligned with the stripe on the shirt. It looked REALLY terrible on, like it were tye dyed by an elementary school kid.<br />I did like the fabric, cut and sizing of this shirt, but if  the alignment of the print is this far off, I would be wary of considering to try their future products, which is a shame, because they are really cute in the photos! (See attached photo for reference.)<br />Very disappointed!"
2.0,Very loose fitting. A lot of stitching was fraying. Having issues with the zipper also.
2.0,Did not lay flat on my neck
2.0,"Soft material but I received a medium top and large pants, neither of which fit. I'm really disappointed 😞"
2.0,Disappointed. I have always worn a straight size 6. These were extremely difficult to put on. I had to use a shoe horn because the back heel collapses and there is no side zipper. I wear a medium and it was way too short and narrow. I returned these shoes.
2.0,Tassels were very bent & unraveling when I received the item.
2.0,Ordered my usual size 40DDand cups were way too small while the band was so stretchy that my normal 40 ended up being to big.  The girls kept falling out the bottom. So my advice would be order a cup size up and a band size down. But bras are so hard to buy without trying on.
2.0,"Attractive otherwise, this shawl is a bit too thin.  A little improvement would make this product much better"
2.0,The arms fit really wierd and I actually had to sew the straps up so that it looked better.
2.0,"Let's be honest, most fit-over sunglasses are awful. These are no exception.<br /><br />These were incredibly unattractive. I can't imagine they would look good on anyone.  Plus they felt really cheap. The only positive is that they weren't huge- although they were fairly wide."
2.0,The feet are huge! Everything else goes great!
2.0,I like the glasses but definitely is hardly a heart shape. I so regret buying them but I guess it's not a huge waste of money but not at all what was advertised. Did come with free bag case though which I didn't expect. Overall not worth buying though
2.0,My daughter wanted these and when they were delivered quite a few were broken. Most of her favorite characters were salvaged so she kept them but if not for her impatience I would have returned
2.0,I really like the neck scarf but the hat was really small. Even my 6 year old said it was to tight for his liking.
2.0,"I expected it to be a similar size as the inage, but it came much bigger and without the necklace it self. It seems to be good quality, my only issue is with its size."
2.0,These got a run in the crotch the first time i wore them. It ran up the butt. So disappointed because they were cute and comfy.
2.0,Very disappointed I received the wrong name.  The product itself seems to be more low quality for jewelry. Something for a kid to wear or something you’d get at Walmart.
2.0,The print is grainy and makes it look cheap.
2.0,Ordered an XL and it fit too tight
2.0,"While these are well made, sturdy glasses, I am disappointed in the orientation of the lenses.  I wanted them to use while lying flat on my back doing stretching.  I tried some my friend has and could easily see the wall in front of me with my head flat on the floor.  These, however require a cushion under my head or tilting on the bridge of my nose (less than comfortable) otherwise I only view the top of the wall near the ceiling.  They are perfect for bed when your head is on a pillow.  I like the idea of making them on some sort of swivel."
2.0,I have only had this bag for a couple of week and it has com apart already. I am not happy about this.
2.0,"It broke as soon as I put it on where the cord is wrapped around the leather.  I kind of fixed it with some effort but needed it for my costume and was in a hurry, was upset that something I just bought was broken!  I didn't expect much for the price, but didn't expect it to fall apart the first time I put it on.  Should have spent more to get better quality.  One positive comment is that it came with a nice black bag."
2.0,Plastic balls cracks easily and some we're missing pieces
2.0,"In my opinion, this shirt is not made for a plus size person. I saw this shirt on a Woman the same week I purchased it and it looked horrible on her, and when I tried it on it didn’t look good on me either. So, if you are not a small thing breasted slimmer person, this may not be a good option."
2.0,I want to send it back
2.0,"great looking watch but it is very heavy and there is 0 adjument for the band, you are taking a gamble buying this watch because unless you just luck out and it fits your wrist perfectly by removing a link then you are out of luck, for me the watch was to large and loose and removing only one link made it too tight.<br /><br />because this watch is so large and heavy if worn loosley like other watches it becomes annoying very fast moving and rotating all over your wrist with any movement, and when too tight its weight seems to cut blood flow down.<br /><br />Over all a very poor design for such a high priced watch."
2.0,"Washed according to care label and red dyes from dress ran into white fur and it looks terrible now, an I would not purchase from this seller again!"
2.0,"Love color, fabric, sleeves, pockets, but those triangular pieces at pockets stick out and make me look bottom heavy. So bummed. I’m not tall enough, it seems.  Bummer!"
2.0,These were very cute. I wore them once. When I went to put them in again today the hinge broke on one of them and I’m out of return period. Very disappointed.
2.0,Fit is perfect but pattern looks NOTHING like the picture it advertises!! Returning...
2.0,Fits to small. It said the color was pink and it was not. It was a mauve color. Wouldn’t buy it again.
2.0,The dimensions are incorrect. 25.2 cm x 46.5 cm. The gaiter itself is the quality I expected but it's too small for my fat face.
2.0,"Don't get me wrong, these chokers are so cute but they're very bad quality. The clip easily rusts and the product  isn't good."
2.0,Too small and too tight. I think I need to go with 2 sizes larger. Well made though.
2.0,Look nice but not very durable. Mine started tearing at the stitch after first use.
2.0,"Too tight better suited for someone long and lean.  In 5’2”, 121 lbs and short waisted.  Looked horrible on me.  But super cute shirt and nice quality"
2.0,"Cute shirts - but if you have any kind of curve on the lower half, I wouldn’t bother. I bought a large (biggest size offered, even though amazon recommends a medium for me in this) and I couldn’t get them over my hips. So if you’re working with anything more than 39” for your hips, they won’t work lol and there’s no stretch."
2.0,Very low quality. I tried on with underwear and you could see every line and color so I can only imagine when it gets wet you could see my entire butt! I tightened the straps all the way because they weren’t very supportive and the fabric was pulling so it is likely the strap would rip with wear.
2.0,I have both this pair of shorts as well as the limited edition Mizuchi shorts. They fit about the same and seem to be the same material. I only gave two stars because the stitching on the velcro is not the high quality that I have come to expect from Hayabusa. The velcro fly came off after the second practice when taking the shorts off.
2.0,"Received these. They were nice but not true to size. Order 1/2” the box said 1/2” but the were too small.<br />Not user error, I’m sure of my size."
2.0,"links broke after 2 wks, orderind a 2 one, hope they give me something off? kal"
2.0,I was hoping for the price a better quality. This had been sitting in my cart for a while.
2.0,Cute shirt. However- found a hole on the right seem when I went to put it on for the 1st time. So bummed.
2.0,"I fell in love with the concept but, it crinkles and cracks like crazy, not the best material, it was not cheap either so... Disappointed"
2.0,"Arms were way too tight - and I have relatively skinny arms. Also, the black strip in the center is just too long - looked very feminine. Too bad, 'cause the color is great (can't seem to find it anywhere else). Had to return."
2.0,"When I put this converter on my bra, I lost support from the bra. Not a great solution."
2.0,"Cute shirt, didn't like the fit and the colors weren't right for my skin."
2.0,I was really looking forward to these masks. They are cute but way too big on the ears and the face. I’m going to try and sew them to get them to fit my face appropriately.
2.0,Material feels itchy on the skin. Fits ok in some areas but not so well I'm other areas. I only bought these because of the value pack and they said they would have pockets and mine do not. Probably more upset about not having pockets then the other stuff.
2.0,"The little gadgets inside the shoe to control the lights on it, broke after just 2 times my grandson wore them. I did not do a review earlier because I just gave them to him last Friday. So, I was disappointed that they broke and he was very disappointed that they do not work anymore. He is just nine years old."
2.0,"I bought this shirt specifically for the cut, the print and the cuffed sleeves.  What I received is completely different.  It's a long shirt with a mundane print and regular sleeves with no cuff.  The material is nice and light and the fit was okay.  Just not the shirt I ordered.  I was very disappointed."
2.0,"Though the measurement is identical to my glasses frame, they don't fit well at all."
2.0,The red in the skirt and the red in the stripes are a very different shade. It looks weird so I will be returning it.
2.0,"The measurements of this watch are incorrect. I bought it because it says here the Case diameter is 29 mm. False, it is 38 mm way too big in real life. The watch itself is pretty and femenine. However, the case diameter and bands are too big if you have small wrists. If your wrist is within 5cm, I do not recommend this watch."
2.0,"The leather and style were great, yet the clasp was broken and not repairable...absolutely no problem with the way the product was packed.  So much for quality control."
2.0,Bit small.
2.0,"The shirt runs big, probably becuase it has dolman sleeves, which I don't like so I will likely return the shirt.  The fabric is very nice but it pretty much looks like dressed up scrubs."
2.0,all of the fancy parts (rose on the ring and most of the bead work) fell off during transit or on the first try-on.
2.0,The color looked so vibrant on the website but in person it looked kind of faded!!!
2.0,quality is so bad. had to return!
2.0,"OK, so I ordered this in one size larger than I normally need because I know these Chinese merchants tend to have a completely skewed idea of sizes versus what we Americans use. It wasn't enough. The shirt fits, but it's so snug that it's pretty much unwearable for now. It's very snug in the chest, belly, and shoulders. It's basically like a Spandex top at this too-small size.<br /><br />So my advice if you decide to go for this is to order at least two sizes larger, but in my opinion if you want a loose fit that feels comfortable and doesn't hug your chest and belly, order two or three sizes larger. That might do the trick.<br /><br />Two stars. Doesn't fit like a Henley should, doesn't match the size they say it is, and just doesn't work for me."
2.0,The earrings are a bit dull.  Does not have that shine you see online.
2.0,"The glasses serve their purpose well enough but instead of being in nice colors they are all very boring colors, mostly browns and that is NOT what I ordered"
2.0,Thought they were for kids but nope  no safety  on them
2.0,"Scratchy as heck on the inside. Outside was more like a brushed rough fleece, no Sherpa to be found on the grey ones."
2.0,Not flattering. Tried it. Went back to an apron
2.0,"I’m pretty disappointed in this item simply because of how small it ran. Based on other reviews I ordered a medium. I should have sized up to an extra large probably. For size reference I’m 5’0 I weight 125lb my bra size is a 32DDD. When I had this item on I was busting out of the sides terribly or there was no support on the bottom and I would be busting out there. It did come padded with removable pads and I tried removing them to see if it would help but it did. Overall, pretty disappointed cause of my breast size. But if your breast could fit then it’s perfect! It’s super soft. I love the material of it."
2.0,These are cute and well made for the price.  But sizing is not well-translated.  Buy up a couple sizes.  Had to return.
2.0,I ordered a small but the top is way too large and the bottoms scrunch up at the crotch I'm 5'2 100 pounds and I'm very disappointed  the sizing isn't as accurate As It Seems.. you really need to offer a extra small for us little girls :-(
2.0,Another set of socks that roll down after walking just a few steps... Waste of money.
2.0,"I really wanted to like this belt. It’s very well made, but the buckle won’t slip through the loops on any of my BDU or Tac pants. Had to thread the belt through, then reattach the buckle."
2.0,"Was flattering, and the stretch was good but the zipper broke bc I’m more thick in the stomach. I look at the tag and it said SHEIN and it was a size small."
2.0,Really like these sunglasses but they broke after 2 months of use. I was very careful with them and always had them in the case when not in use. Then when I put them on my face yesterday they right arm snapped. Unfortunately I was unable to contact the seller to see about a refund.
2.0,avoid this product. Quite noisy
2.0,"WOW, is this material paper thin!  Runs very small and has unnecessary pockets that take away from the look of the pants.  Order 1-2 sizes up from your normal size, depending on how tight you like things to fit.  I'm returning mine, would have liked to get a larger size, that that was not offered when I returned them."
2.0,The pearls are bigger than expected... so I didn't like it...
2.0,The sizes at the waist was way off on this dress. I ordered a small and it was way too big in the waist and stomach area.
2.0,It didn’t work for me . Not as I expected. Too harsh on the feet and didn’t help with any symptoms.
2.0,Disappointed. Only three of the six quick release  actually work.
2.0,"Not super impressed. Quite thin with no warmth. Quality is not the best either and the color is different then pictured, it is more of a salmon color with does not appeal to me. I expected a better product for the price."
2.0,"Just eh. Nothing special. Jumping on the minecraft name. Trust me, unless the child in your life specifically asked for these (and why would he/she), don’t waste your money. Get them something else."
2.0,"This dress was HUGE. I am usually a size 4-5, 125lbs and I was SWIMMING in the Medium. I immediately sent it back. I think this would be a great and really complimentary dress for big beautiful curves, though!"
2.0,Not quality you would expect very thin .
2.0,"I wear a size 16 and usually an XL, my chest is 38. I ordered a XL this was way to small could not even zip. Not recommended for those with broad chest."
2.0,"I have a hard time locking it up on my wrist, otherwise it looks good. I can't work with it though."
2.0,"Great wallet but came with a pink clasp. Picture showed green and blue. My son was not happy about the pink. So he wouldn't clasp it to his pants,  now its lost:(<br />Amazing wallet though."
2.0,"Its more narrow then described, the color is slightly diff from pictured too"
2.0,"My son is small and usually wears a medium but ordered him a large because the description advised ordering a size up.  The jacket arrived quickly and that was great.  Sadly, the jacket is very tight and the hood won't even zip up.  My son was bummed but has wanted this jacket for so long that he wanted to keep it even though he can't zip the hood up and wear it as a costume."
2.0,Isn't really wind-proof. Touch screen doesn't work
2.0,Largest size is too small
2.0,I wish you could actually see the etching on the bracelet as shown in the picture.  Disappointed with that part of it.
2.0,The sleeves are too short and only goes down to my waist. I ordered a medium and I am 5’4.
2.0,The chains ate falling off.  Not good quailty
2.0,"The retention ends kept opening up and catching on clothing. Yes, I could push them back down but really annoying to have to do that!"
2.0,Looks like a dollar store product. Don't feel like I can put in my webpage! My goal is to make my people happy and my non profit causes get there 20%
2.0,"This necklace is not 24&#34;. I do not know what measuring method they use but it looks about 18&#34;.  It stops right at the bottom of my throat when it should be somewhere around my chest. And even with a ruler it is 19&#34; including the clasps! So, I have no idea who or what measuring system they are using. It gets two stars for at least looking like the necklace pictured.<br /><br />0"
2.0,"It does look like the picture. However, it runs small. I'm usually a medium and I definitely needed a large. I'm 5'6, 130lbs, 36C - need at least a large in this suit."
2.0,The jewel is microscopic. Bought it for a Monroe piercing and it won’t even work
2.0,I’ve only been using one of these bands for 3 days and the color is rubbing off.. it’s a shame because the style and shape are great
2.0,It can’t cover lights from sides only from top side .
2.0,"First these arent true to size. 2xl fits like XL. Also the picture shows a longer length in the legs, they are like briefs but a tiny bit longer. They are not boxer briefs!"
2.0,Very cute shoes but way to big!
2.0,I had ordered a medium before and it wasn’t quite as long as I would like so I ordered an XL and it was even shorter! I was so disappointed.
2.0,"The product and price is ok but the Supplier/the delivery is not enough, everyone should check the quantity inside box, I bought 400 masks but received 340 masks."
2.0,I wear consistently a 14/16 across all brands and ordered an XXL. I could hardly get this over my arms. If you wear over a 10/12 don't bother with this dress.
2.0,"The item seems great, sturdy and strong... but the chain literally broke within a few weeks. Upsetting."
2.0,Th original that I bought less than a year ago fit my size 6 foot far better and they a nice/sturdier texture
2.0,This was too small for me in the bust. I normally wear a 2x and that is what I ordered. Very pretty and length reached the ankle. Ended up giving it to a friend.
2.0,I took this jumpsuit on a cruise to wear my second night out.  I put it on and ready to walk out the cabin door and my friend says.  Hey look at the split on the leg.  I looked down and thought ok.  Looked for split on the other side and nothing.<br />When I took it off the sewing on the split leg seam was so on the edge that it had no material to do anything with it.<br />I had to find something else to wear.
2.0,"This is a great looking vest. Fits well, has a number of storage pockets. BUT ... I am allergic to it! You may be as well. I have asked the seller twice, if this is a sterilzied hypoalergenic fill, but my question gets deleted with no answer. I own many Baleaf shirts and tops, I wanted to love this vest, but if my face gets red and itches, and eyes are irritated by wearing it ... it goes back!"
2.0,Nice pants but immediately start to pill
2.0,These leggings are very comfortable but I ordered a three pack of black and received a pack of mixed colors.  Everything else about the product is fine.  They are very soft and fit as expected.
2.0,The product doesn't run true to the advertised size.
2.0,"It's an attractive hat. Seems to be well made enough. But when you lower the ear flaps, they just hang down with no pressure against the ears. Therefore, no protection against even a breeze. I sent them back."
2.0,"The fit was good.  Material, not so hot... but each one I purchased had stains on them right in the top part where it shows."
2.0,Horrible quality now the color turn black
2.0,"Runs too small, not very stretchy but they are very cute !"
2.0,It’s beautiful but has some issues
2.0,"Don’t spend your hard earned money!  I got these to stop using hot hands packs.  The tips of my fingers got cold after 10 minutes working in freezer, I also put 2 vinyl gloves on underneath.  My hands got cold after 45 minutes working in fridge.The elastic band is fraying.  So I’m going back to the hunters gloves with hot hands."
2.0,"I purchased this brand because my usual brand is no longer sold here. The pros: The colours were great and it arrived quickly.<br />The cons: The top of the bra made an unsightly cut across chest and there is literally a ""pop out"" where your nipple is supposed to go. This essentially gave you permanent ""headlights"". For me, I couldn't keep wearing these bras."
2.0,"Very cheap quality, just go to Claire's instead"
2.0,"Bummed out as soon as I opened the plastic wrap the pants were in and the waist button fell to the floor.<br />They are a Lil snug, not bad... more like a size 6. I am 5’7 150 and usually wear between a 6-8 depending on make.<br />I am really bad at returning, and need them for a trip so I will just belt them to get away with no waist button.<br />The embellished zippers and rivets on the pockets are not coated? I fear washing might stain/rust the pants? Time will tell...."
2.0,The fabric is cheap and unbreathable
2.0,"This piece, while beautiful, broke upon wearing approx. 15 minutes. The tiny ring holding the toe loop let go. Instead of returning the item, I will repair the loop myself. It is a cute accessory that I look forward to wearing longer."
2.0,"Love the texture and design but it did not fit...way too tight in the arms. Im a plus size usually wears 2x to 3x tops, i do have large arms, but 3x tops fit perfect. I purchased the 3x and it was too tight on my arms and does not fit loose like i expected. My daughter who wears a size large is able to wear it but it's very baggy on her."
2.0,"I don't have super fat neck, but I just couldn't even lock this necklace on it. so yeah."
2.0,"I hate giving bad reviews!  Son picked this as a Christmas gift for wife, his mother, I didn't read the reviews beforehand that it has a heavy chemical smell.  Other reviews say that it doesn't wash out.  I asked dear wife to put it in the wash, but she didn't want to transfer that chemical smell to our other clothes.  She put it by the front door for a few days, then she said it started to make the hallway stink, so she threw it out!  I was disappointed, as the pajamas looked comfortable and looked good on the model, but dear wife refused to even try it on because of the strong chemical smell. I was disappointed, because I really wanted to see dear wife wear the pajamas that her son gave to her as a gift, but that didn't happen."
2.0,"It is good, having light material. After wash it is not good."
2.0,"I was excited to receive this item in the mail but it didnt last very long.  The dangled hearts fallen apart within few hours, I tried to put them back but the hooks already broken apart. Very disappointed with the materials."
2.0,"Nice Earrings, how ever the backing never stays on longer than 5minutes, if that!"
2.0,Tail stayed deflated. Looked like a wrinkle mess. It was still cute but never again.
2.0,Through  out the day I'd  have to keep re tightening the bracelet. Was very annoying.also lasted only a few months before the ojo broke off.
2.0,Falls apart easily and very cheap
2.0,"This dress was too big and too small at the same time.  I'm only 5'3"" and nothing fell in the right spot. The top was large but the waist was at my hips and was too tight.  I wouldn't bother with it if you're short or curvy.  Also it is a costume made of cheap costume fabric,  so don't think you're getting more than one wear out of it"
2.0,"The necklace was really pretty and I was able to wear it for about a day, before the piece that holds it in the stone fell out. So now I have to try and find some super glue or something to stick it back together. I wish that it was more resilient."
2.0,"Order small, they all run big, I ordered a medium and they are huge!!!"
2.0,Is not one size fits all. It runs small.
2.0,The 25 pack had 22 keychains.  About half of the snap in covers had to be trimmed to be able to snap in.
2.0,The plastic is thinner than I thought it would be. It might tear soon.
2.0,I used to have a hat exactly like this from the San Diego hat company.  I bought this one expecting it fit the same way but unfortunately the hat was different.  Didn't fit as well as expected and didn't bend to the shape I wanted.  The hat also had a very chemical smell.  For the price it works but if you are looking for a more quality hat I do not recommend.
2.0,"Ordered L, sleeves too short, length too short. Not Amazon returnable easily, womp."
2.0,This is a surprisingly small watch. Far too small for a man's wrist. OK for a woman or child.
2.0,Very very large. 18-24 mo looks like a 3T
2.0,The shirt is completely see thru. Very sheer. I can't add a photo because you can see my bra and everything.
2.0,"I love the quality and look, but the opening it too large for my small wrists. When I take the hair band off the bracelet falls off."
2.0,"I did not like the material, doesn't look like the picture"
2.0,"I got this swimsuit for the summer and it looks very pretty but it's a little faded when it came in and also the front part is loose so boobs fall out it also is see-through When Wet, the crotch part is very tight so it looks like I have a camel toe would not be ordering this any time soon does not look anything like the picture"
2.0,"It's one size for several different pin sizes (16-22mm; ergo the actual band width is only 15mm wide, which is pretty thin looking on 40+mm watch faces.  Additionally, if you have like 8.5"" wrists; depending on the size of the watch, the fit can be a little tight..?  Overall it's still a decent twist-o-flex."
2.0,"they look kinda matte in the picture which was going to look awesome with my outer gear, but turns out its shiny as can be.  isnt built as nice as my smiths, oaklies or k2's."
2.0,"Si son bonitas, y grandes cómodas,"
2.0,Disappointed in length. It’s much shorter than the picture shows. Very wrinkly fabric.
2.0,"I liked it, it just didnt fit."
2.0,"They will serve the purpose of keeping things &#34;bundled&#34; together ie underwear, socks etc so the suitcase is more organized but they are very cheaply made and not high quality. I ordered two sets...one for me and one for a gift. I am considering returning the second set as I will be embarassed to give them as a gift. I also do not &#34;appreciate&#34; the silly stuff printed on the bags: Secret Pouch etc. Not too impressed."
2.0,I returned it too thin
2.0,"Received this item as a gift, its cute but wore it for one day and it turned my skin green...very disappointed."
2.0,To tight in forearms and long in the wait.<br /><br />6&#34; 185
2.0,"Two stars bc it is mega comfy. I ordered a lrg, Im 5'3 ad the product is short on me.  It doesnt fit as I expected. Thought it would be pleated and drape almost skirt like but more like just wide leg yoga pant."
2.0,Poor quality jeans.  The stitching looked awful like someone put labels on a pair of no name pants.
2.0,"Not what I expected  that it would be thicker , it's more like a shirt"
2.0,After 4 weeks the minute hand doesn't work.  It moves freely.  Overall the watch was nice for the price.  Got it for my daughter.  Saw a lot of people complaining about the size.  Size of course is relative.  To some it might be big and to others not. It does give dimensions of the watch in the description so  don't know why all the complaints.  My 11 year old daughter liked it and I thought it fit nicely.  Other than the minute hand broke it was an okay watch.
2.0,"This jumpsuit was not for me I am 5‘4“ 130 pounds and ordered a medium. The medium was way too big but looked kind of cute, so I ordered a small and the small was still too big and didn’t look as cute.It’s a bit high waisted and the legs of it is pretty baggy. It just may be my body shape that it doesn’t fit, because it looks cute on other people in the pictures."
2.0,Very cheap it appeared to made from felt there was no thickness to the coat. I’m sure after one wear the material would bead up but I wouldn’t know because I returned it.
2.0,"Cheaply made, bad fabric. Should have been cheaper  with the quality actually. But fits good. I do like them regardless. Id expect to pay 3-4$ honestly on the make. But since its here, i get what i get."
2.0,I do not like the newer type of sport sock now available in white. It is much too tight. The type of material has been changed from what I got a few years ago. It is more like cotton whereas the material a few years ago was more like spandex.
2.0,The bangles were exactly what I wanted but one of the black bangles broken before the night was over.<br /><br />They look nice but they are not good quality.
2.0,The attachment ring broke after just a few days…
2.0,Clean and packaged but hot to wear used as disney character.
2.0,"First, there is a substantial embroidered ""CAMEL"" logo on the right front chest area (see photo), a full two inches wide, and there is no way to remove it because it is sewn in with individual threads. The logo is almost invisible in the product photos. I hate things like this, and I never would have ordered in the first place had I known the logo would be there.<br /><br />Second, I ordered size XXL and the outer packaging (see photo) clearly reads XXL, but the label on the hoodie itself (see photo) reads ""US XL; EU XXL; UK XXL; JP 3XL; CN 190/112A"" and, since I am in the US expecting US sizes, what I actually received was XL and not XXL. I tried it on and it is large enough that I can wear it over a T-shirt, but it would be tight over a reasonably thick sweater.<br /><br />I got a really good price, $20 instead of the usual $40, so I'm debating whether it is worth returning. This hoodie was a real disappointment, as the build quality seems high and the material is warm and comfortable, but it is definitely not what I was led to expect from the product description and photos."
2.0,Looks good but feel cheep
2.0,"The strap is actually of great quality. It’s been difficult hunting down 26mm straps for my Panerai’s, but this did the trick. I’m leaving a low star review because the length needs to be addressed ASAP. I have an eight inch wrist, and it’s way too short to be worn as a proper 5 ring. I would say the strap needs to be about three inches longer as people can always cut off and cauterize excess length."
2.0,This shapewear didnt do much for my stomach at all. I'm 4'11 122lbs .I ordered a small. I have a belly.... This barely made a difference on me.
2.0,Charm fell off first day I wore it.
2.0,Many reviews said thia dress was lined but mine is not.... Also very short. The color is beautiful but not a 4 season dress like description said. Not sure if I will be keeping this.
2.0,this was not what i thought.i wore it once and if turn to a dif color.very poor quality.improve the quaity of this product but it also came in a good park.
2.0,"Had a stone missing but other than that, cute as expected. I don’t think they will last long though."
2.0,The quality is out of my image.show as picture above! Only wearing one time for swimming class and one time for Legoland. I bought 7years old size but I think it is only for for 5 years old who is normal weight.
2.0,"Runs small order up.  It’s not entirely too small, but at least one size bigger would’ve been better."
2.0,"I bought this grey from this seller, as the grey was also misrepresented (even more so) from another seller. None of the colors of this shirt are as represented in the pictures. Sure, grey is not going to be an exciting color, but this shirt does not know what color it's supposed to be. It's more of like a dingy, drab color that changed in the wash. Not the cool light grey pictured.<br />The fit is nice as I like things fitted. I'm tall and a 14/16 and the XL fit perfectly and as expected."
2.0,"It is much smaller than the picture of the model. Maybe she has a small head than me. That isn't so bad, but the hat came all folded in 3 - 4 parts. I cannot fix it to look like the way I want.  I read that in other reviews, but I decided to take a chance. It was a bad gamble. I cannot use this hat. I would like to recommend that they ship it better so that it is not folded and squished."
2.0,Didn’t last long at all! Brim folded n fabric came off waste of money tbh
2.0,I am a large but I ordered a XXL just to make sure. Well good thing I did because the XXL fit.  This fabric is not flattering and is extremely see through.
2.0,Not a good cap front much too long
2.0,"Such a cute top…I wanted to love it but the fit was a bit too boxy, not very flattering"
2.0,Washes terrible
2.0,"The mask, for as long as the wiring holds, is really cool. But the wiring broke at the power source really quickly. It's really too expensive to be this janky."
2.0,Very cheaply made. Caused my ears to break out.
2.0,"In 2019 I bought the pink version of this coat and received a coat that was well made, with nice thick material.  So this year I'd decided to buy the navy and black version.  I just received the navy version and I'm sad to say that the quality has gone way down.  The material is thin so that at best I'll be able to use it as a early fall/late spring piece.  I have not received the black version yet but I am now not anxiously waiting to see what I get."
2.0,"This nightgown is comfortable and flattering, but it showed signs of wear within three days after purchasing it.  I washed it, and now this gown looks as if I have had it for a couple of years.  I am disappointed in the material and would not recommend or repurchase.  The material really needs to be upgraded."
2.0,After a week the Velcro falls apart.
2.0,expensive for material but clasp is nice 2.5 star
2.0,"This is definitely nothing like a sweatshirt so if that is what you want, don’t buy this. The material is a slippery, thin fabric. Nothing like I thought when I read sweatshirt. They should take that word out of description. It would make a great shirt in cotton fabric."
2.0,size is like one and half smaller
2.0,"The item is adorable, and really wish that I could say it’s comfortable, but I don’t know because I couldn’t fit into it. I ordered my size, but the size discrepancy was huge…but even close."
2.0,"Cute dress, but much smaller than expected. Bought a XL and it fit like medium."
2.0,"At first it seems to be well made, but it definitely isn't. The seam in the hat ripped within a week of wearing it."
2.0,Runs small and cheap feel
2.0,These are very comfortable but I bought them to work out in and they are NOT squat proof at all. You can see my whole butt when I squat. They are really comfortable though so if you just want to wear them and don’t plan on squatting or bending over you’ll probably like them.
2.0,Very weird fit at the bust.
2.0,It runs small. I would order two sizes up. Not as pictured. It’s very high cut in front.
2.0,No. It was not true to size. Ordered an 8 and the 8 was to big.
2.0,in very disappointed. the glasses are crooked and I have to keep adjusting the edges to sit on my face. I'm gonna send them back
2.0,"Did not care for the material, which affected how the skirt looked on me.  It did not flatter my<br />body at all.  I am returning."
2.0,I’ve bought this shirt before in the same size and it fit great. This time when I bought it in a different color in the exact same size it fit at least 2 sizes too small. The shirt looked the same (different color) but the label was different. Clearly this supplier from China has very inconsistent sizing which is a shame because the shirt is really cute.
2.0,"If you get this and it does not fit, you pay for returns."
2.0,"Really small especially on the arms, are usually wear a size medium and the large didn’t even fit me"
2.0,The magnet doesn’t hold very well. The fit of the pins is off too. Very hard to replace or take off to clean.
2.0,I bought this watch at a swim meet for my daughter.  She has worn it maybe 3 times a week while swimming for less than 2 month.  The face has already fogged with moisture.  I won't recommend this watch for a someone who wants to swim with it on.
2.0,It was a nice hat but mine wasn’t fleece lined so I returned it. It had about an inch & 1/2 knit band on the inside instead.
2.0,not even close to proper sizing
2.0,The good :<br />I love the nylon strap.  It's very strong and the colors are very nice.<br /><br />The price was very reasonable.<br /><br />The adhesion and plastic piece that fits inside your case seems good quality.<br /><br />The bad :<br />The ring is plastic!<br />It feels cheaper than other lanyards I've purchased.<br />The break away piece (shown in the pic). Is weak and releases way too easily!!<br />I would not use this lanyard for anything important or expensive.<br /><br />A name badge is perfect.  It's about all the weight it will hold.<br /><br />I'm not happy with this lanyard.  I purchased it for my cell phone... Which is stated in the information that it will work for a cell phone... .. I didn't realize it was a break away lanyard!!<br /><br />While just walking.... my Brand new cell phone (S-20) came loose from the lanyard and hit the pavement!! I don't even understand why you would want a break away lanyard! Because<br />The ring pops off when you need to release the phone from the lanyard!<br /><br />So just be aware.. Do not buy this for anything important or expensive.  Keys might fall off and you could lose them... Or worse.. You're brand new cell phone could hit the ground for no reason at all!<br />I would generally rate this lanyards 3 stars but not after my phone hit the ground.
2.0,"Did not like fabric. Just was not what I had expected,"
2.0,"I'm 5' 8&#34;. Washed & air-dried, immediately after receiving. Texas floods have nothing on these pants. Above my ankles. Only worn in private. When will clothes designers know, you can alter up - not down?"
2.0,You know how sometimes you buy an item online and it arrives and it looks nothing like the picture? That's what happened to me. I was buying this for a piece of decor I was making. I wanted a detailed and multicolored pocket watch with silver and copper or bronze for the piece. I received a gold-colored wrist watch on a brown strap.
2.0,"They are a cute design but I had to return them because they were too small, even after going with a slightly larger size. If you have a more narrow foot they might fit."
2.0,The tassels fell apart after three uses. Cheaply made and are very heavy.
2.0,it fits weird too small
2.0,"They hurt for the hour they stay on. Then, they fall off to be lost forever."
2.0,Perdió el color por completo a la semana
2.0,"As others mention,  I have had problems with the wire that gives stiffness to the shape of the backpack.  I have to keep clipping it and then fighting it snagging on my clothes when I carry the backpack.  I like the bag from a functionality standpoint but the wire just keeps coming out and the bag has less and less shape."
2.0,"The sizing for these are off. They’re adorable, I just can’t find the right sizes for my girls. I ordered a 7 which were too small so I ordered an 8 and when I hold them up the 8 is not even a hair bigger. I ordered an 11 for my other daughter and they were way too big.  They’re really cute so I’m very disappointed I couldn’t get them to work."
2.0,"The product was too tight and that &#34;cooling feeling&#34; comes from not being able to feel your blood run through your arm. But thanks to amazon's great customer service, they refunded the money right away."
2.0,I don’t like how it tight even though I got a size bigger then what my 1 year old is in
2.0,"Like the colors but the chain itself definitely looks fate. Some costume jewelry even though its costume, looks as though its not but you can spot this a mile away.  But then again the price is really cheap."
2.0,"The color doesn't look the same at all! The ones that arrived were completely black, I LOVED these because of their heathered gray look and I'm so sorely disappointed that they did not arrive as expected. :("
2.0,I missed an ordered the wrong glasses an had already taking the tags off; so I didn't worry about trying to send them back gave them away
2.0,Product seemed good until it feel apart after a few weeks.
2.0,you got to have a stick size neck to wrap that around twice.
2.0,The pearl keep falling apart
2.0,"I love my Oakley Blender sunglasses, but my lenses were scratched and peeling.  Since Oakley no longer makes them I started researching replacement brands.  I settled on Revant and I might be a little bit harsh in my review, because it isn't Oakley... but it isn't Oakley.  The lenses are polarized, which I do like.  But the lens is just slightly smaller than the original and it does fall out if you apply too much pressure cleaning them.  They pop right back in, but I never had the originals fall out.  These lenses are also much lighter tinted than I expected and there is no mirror finish to them at all.  My eyes are clearly visible through these lenses.  Basically, I'm back to the drawing board looking for something I'll be happier with."
2.0,"These are one use gloves, and barely at that.  They fell apart almost immediately.  I bought them for cigarette-girl costumes for my catering crew to wear while passing out appetizers at a film festival.  They completed the costume, but I would never buy these again."
2.0,"Cute, comfortable, way too fragile. It broke in 3 weeks"
2.0,This dress was not what I thougt it would be.  The material is like a jersey material and is not very flattering at all.  Definitely unsuitable for work.  It's a shame I didn't read the reviews before purchasing as it could have saved me some disappointment!
2.0,Irritates your skin. Works for Amazfit Band 5.
2.0,So cute but broke the first time I wore it
2.0,I really liked the eye snug it was really comfortable and did block out the light well. I would have originally given this 5 stars but I only gave it two because I have only owned mine for maybe 2 months give or take and it's starting to fall apart at the bottom in the arch around the nose and also above the nose at the top. I'm not sure why it's doing this and it really bums me out bc this initially was a really good product I felt. Would love for the company to send me a replacement.
2.0,WAY larger than expected
2.0,"I had ordered a multi colored dress in this style first. And I Loved the way it fit/hung and the silky feel of the material.<br />So I ordered two more. One in red and one in blue.<br />The material is Not the same. Not silky at all. So the dress did not hang, fit, or feel the same. Actually kind of heavy compared to the multicolored one I had ordered first.<br />Item has been returned."
2.0,I was looking for a evening out blouse.  Would wear more this  likely with a work uniform.
2.0,"i’ve had these shoes for like 2 years now and they still hurt! the strap cuts into my ankle 👎👎 i wish i hadn’t bought them, they cost so much $$"
2.0,Too small for an average man...maybe OK for woman or man with small wrist.  I gave it away.
2.0,"BUYER BEWARE!!!<br /><br />Not too thrilled anymore.<br />From the minute I bought this purse, I was excited to receive it. It came in the mail pretty quickly and I loved it!! It was huge, there was so much space left that I couldn't even fill, and it was super freaking cute.<br />Well, when I had had it for 9 days, I was walking into the grocery store... Just walking with it on my arm, and the strap broke. There's no way it broke from weight because I only had my (small) wallet, my checkbook, phone, car keys and gum in it. It wasn't the age... Purses that I paid $5 for, carried more than that and lasted years. So I can only think that either it's crappy quality or I got a defective one. I'd like to think it's defective because the other strap seems ok and nothing else is wrong with it.<br />Well I complained to the company and they gave me a partial refund. I'm thankful for at least that, but I didn't want a refund, I wanted a functional purse!!!<br />So just know that the same thing might happen to you."
2.0,Did not have a “curve” to the fit. Cut straight instead of a curve for the hip. Unexpectedly tight in the hip. Gave them away.
2.0,"Went to my daughters and saw this robe in the bathroom with holes in the seams and pocket coming apart. This robe was poorly sewn too close to the edges, therefore, the holes and ripped pocket. My grandson is two and only wears this after a bath for 10-15 min. This should not look like this within 36 days. This seller offered a refund within 60 days if there was a quality issue. I returned and got most of my money back but not a full refund as stated. If you purchase, check all the seams upon receipt!"
2.0,Too hard to go to<br />The bathroom zipper area does not open wide enough which causes me to urinate everywhere
2.0,"I really liked it ,till the middle mirrow part came off,then you could see everything through it ,I tried painting it,but that didn't really work so good."
2.0,"When I ordered them, the label said they were black. The picture was of black socks. I got them today and the picture has been changed to green socks, with in the bulleted description it stating they are military green, while still being labeled as black above the bullets. I also think the picture was changed cuz they were certainly black when I ordered them. ONLY BUY IF YOU WANT GREEN."
2.0,"Arrived on time , only 2 styles in bag while picture shows all different. Size is more like a large than xlarge(small)"
2.0,was not true to size. I ordered 1 size larger then I normally wear and it was still a little snug.
2.0,"I wanted to have a wool-based base layer pants.I am 5'6'', 120lb and I ordered size S. It was so large that it is not remotely possible to wear it as a base layer. I had to return it. This brand doesn't carry XS and I am not sure even XS would be a good fit for me . This could be a better choice for someone who wants a loose bottom layer.Other than that, the fabric felt soft . The waistband is made of elastic band only."
2.0,I purchased this and ultimately returned it. It was too short for my liking and I felt like it would ride up constantly.
2.0,Really cheap chain.
2.0,Uncomfortable to wear. Not worth the money. Would rather use my old regular garden gloves.
2.0,This dress is made flimsy material and is see-thru.
2.0,This is pretty small for an XL and the graphic is sewn on crooked.
2.0,Just not comfortable at all :(
2.0,"Not great. The material is thin and while the outside is soft, the inside’s itchy. The arms are snug and fits small. Not a great buy."
2.0,Very pretty but this is for a short person with a short torso under 5 ft 3.  I am 5 ft 6 with a long torso and it did not cover my crotch.
2.0,"They came way too late for the reason I ordered them and one was broken...I kept them to use in the future. They are nice looking, just wish the delivery was faster....not broken."
2.0,"Very disappointed, item is warped, small and completely unusable. Ordered last minute to complete a ren-fest look, but item is only made for Kids. Even with the Velcro, it will not fit. Item is also warped and would not even look good if I extended the Velcro in the back. See pictures. Unfortunately I will not be able to salvage this piece and will be returning it."
2.0,Item arrived with a stain on it. Appears to be make up ... I hope. Also when I tried the first one on that didn’t have a stain it fit so tight. I felt like this was a mother and kid set verses to adult sizes as advertised. I would have kept them though if the one that fit didn’t have the stain on it.
2.0,"Bracelet it cute but it broke within a few days of wearing it..  Great concept just not well made or, maybe I just got a dud :-("
2.0,"Be aware that some are apparently not receiving the product that is depicted.  The item clearly states six double-sided windows but the item received only has four.  In addition, the item shown in the picture has rounded corners while the item received has square corners.  Otherwise the item seems to be of good quality, hence +1 star."
2.0,Is quite large
2.0,"The hoop and bar looked ok, but the chain is very short (14in).  Could barley fit around my GF's neck which I'm pretty sure is a normal neck..."
2.0,The images make it look like it is soft and flowy which is very misleading. The fabric is soft but not flowy... the cotton-ish material is clingy and wrinkles and sticks to itself showing every flaw of your body. Also the lace at the neck curls so it looks like it is not even there. And it is itchy and scratchy. I am not happy with the purchase.
2.0,Band is very narrow and seems more like a female type width. Also the band is not very large. I got this one as it was the largest one I could find in this style. It still only fits on the last hole. The color is like a flat grey color. The picture makes it look almost black.
2.0,for the first month and a half everyone loved it but then it started rusting like crazy so now i cant let anyone see it all rusted.
2.0,I am 5’10” and the straps are too short. Disappointed
2.0,"The hat felt very stiff, and it was accompanied by some religious/pro-life messaging which was off-putting."
2.0,Band broke in less than 30 days. Love look of it. Not made to wear and take off everyday.
2.0,"This mask has a very strong order that immediately made my eyes water. My house was quickly filled with the same stench, so I put it outside to air out for 2 days. I even tried washing it. This mask smells so bad."
2.0,The fit does not look anything like the photo once you put it on. The neck hole is definitely not big enough to do the off the shoulder look and the arms are verging on too tight. It also doesn't have the same hi-low look as in the picture. It also smelled REALLY REALLY bad when I first got it. I had to soak it in vinegar and hand wash it multiple times to get the smell out.
2.0,"It isn't great. The material is kinda like workout or bathing suit material. The patches don't stay on your elbow. The stitch came undone after a few times of wearing it. It is cute, so i still wear it, but only occasionally. Not a hot buy."
2.0,"I bought this for a Lucy VanPelt (Charlie Brown) Halloween costume and it served its purpose, but when I washed it it shrank by at least a size or two and didn’t hold its shape at all. Shame on me for putting it in the dryer. I should have known.<br /><br />I am 5’7” and 135 lbs and I bought a medium."
2.0,"Looks really nice and loved the date magnifier but stopped running after a week or so, started again and then stopped again. I think it’s due to the perpetual motion charging feature but stopped during the night and only off my wrist for about 8 hours. Very disappointed but would not recommend."
2.0,"It's stretchy and comfy and fits well, but it's super see through so I don't trust it in public, and it seems very cheaply made- the holes the drawstrings come out of are just little cuts in the fabric, no stitching or reinforcement of any kind. I'm not confident that this won't fall apart when I wash it, so I am returning it.<br />The second picture is without any added lighting, just my white wall behind the pants- you can see the wall through the fabric, between my fingers."
2.0,Love the earrings but one of them came without a hook
2.0,Too short for long torsos. Scratchy fabric. Weird sleeves.
2.0,"I bought this as a gift for my mom, boyfriend (ex now LOL), and his mom. It was super cute and super bright, but unfortunately it was not bound very tightly. All of the bracelets fell apart within about two weeks. I wish it were just made a little better (:("
2.0,It’s cute but it doesn’t look like the picture plus material is like a rayon
2.0,"It fits in shoulders, sleeves, and length<br />But, front wears like a vest.<br />It doesn't cover the front of you"
2.0,"Right off the bat, I had a feeling my package was a returned item since it looked like the stuff was just thrown back in the bag. I took the items out of the bag and there were no tags attached so I didn’t even want to try it on. I started to at least fold the items up and put them back nicely in the bag when I noticed a stain near the hood that looked like snot or bird poop or some weird s#i+. Disappointed that this was what I received. Yuck! Barf!"
2.0,The shirt was ok. It was a little too short for a Large. The material of the shirt was rough not soft. I have a feeling that the picture will peel off when I wash it.
2.0,"So if u want a fall shirt,this is a good one.<br />In the pics look like a dress,but it is not!fit just too right"
2.0,"We thought getting this suit would be perfect for a day at the water park. When wet the fabric looks like velvet, my daughter loved that! Because she loved it she was determined to take care of it, so much so that she rinsed herself with the suit on to make sure all chlorine was removed promptly. After a few hours wearing I noticed the entire backside was pilling. For the price we were hoping to at least get more than 1 wear out of it!!!!"
2.0,"Loved the price point of this dress, but you get what you pay for here. I W as really hoping it would be great for my rehearsal dinner. It looks good in pictures in other reviews but in person it really looks cheap. Also, the middle of the underlay part up top was higher than the sides (in the chest area), so it looks really awkward there. Will be sending back."
2.0,"Too tight in the bust area, upper arm area, and fit too short on the hip line in the back. Fit more like an xl petite"
2.0,These run very big
2.0,Lightweight material and I’m sure it’s comfortable but the sizing on this dress is crap. Fits everywhere except the waist which is nowhere near large enough compared to the sizing chart. If you’re an apple shape just keep browsing elsewhere.
2.0,Too small for a 2xx and the material was too thin.
2.0,"Didn't like the ""polyester-like"" material"
2.0,The earrings are very pretty but thin and a lot of the studs had turned black on the back posts right into the whit gummy you place as not to lose your earrings must have sat for a very long time very disopointed.
2.0,Does not hang the way it looks in the picture - not as full.  I have washed it twice as there is a great deal of sizing in the material.  The color has faded a lot.  I would not order again knowing what I do now.
2.0,"This dress was smaller than expected. And shorter than most maxi dresses. And I'm only 5'4&#34;. The material is like a thin, cheap polyester material. The color is pretty and the design is exactly like the picture. Definitely go up a size or two."
2.0,Runs small and knit is thin/fine/see through. This was a gift but did not give it due to quality.
2.0,Some of the socks barely go on my feet.  The stitching is so tight I cannot get them over my heel.  Solid pairs are fine.
2.0,"Bag was a lot bigger than expected.  Also, hardware was gold (which I cannot stand) instead of silver as the pictures appear to show.  I don't care for it and will likely give it away.  I used a bag I already owned for the conference I bought this one for."
2.0,"Its okay but was cut oddly.  The material is not breathable, it's okay for cold days but it wont be a regular and will likely find it's way to Goodwill very soon."
2.0,Not as shown on picture. You have to open the item to see the correct assortment. I bought these for my the full Spider-Man as shown on the front picture. I never bothered to check the assortment when I opened the item to purchase. I would not have spent $20 for 3 pair of boys briefs.
2.0,"These look ok. Have a terrible smell that would probably wash out but Im returning. I ordered the 10-12 size M for a 10 year old girl and they are way too small, more like for a 6 year old. Im just going to order something from a more established business like REI or Columbia Sports to get the sizing right."
2.0,"Normally these are great, but my newest pair already have a hole in them after a month of buying them."
2.0,The color was closer to burgundy than maroon and It doesn’t look as good on as it does online. I didn’t expect anything crazy nice for the price but I have bought nicer for the same price.
2.0,Smells like mold too. :-( I like it but I can't keep it.
2.0,"It seams to be very well made. It has a good heft and fits my, rather large arms.<br />I have to amend my review a bit. I have had the watch for 3 days and the clasps that hold the band shut have fallen off. It looks like the holes that the spring pin sit in are almost nonexistent. Nothing I cant fix, but I shouldn't have to."
2.0,"fit is awkward, fall down when you are working out"
2.0,Not how the picture looks
2.0,"Great material, but fit small and I bought 3 sizes bigger. The biggest issue is a seam down the back which is too short and draws the material into a permanent wedgie."
2.0,This boot used to be awesome. The last pair I bought squeaked horribly. Hopefully that problem can be fixed by the manufacturer.
2.0,so tight
2.0,my wife said they were to uncomfortable.
2.0,"Considering these are called &#34;infant newborn&#34; shoes I expected them to be small enough to fit my 7 week old for Christmas.  This is certainly not the case, they are way to big for an infant."
2.0,"Very weak magnetic closure. It pops open with just a light touch. Scared it will open in my bag and spill everything out. Pretty design, though"
2.0,"I wear size 10 or 11, depending on the shoe. These are definitely NOT size 11-12 as advertised, they are a small size 10. Also, they are not soft. The memory foam is so thin that it is almost not noticeable. I am returning these slippers."
2.0,Not a good size for anyone under 9 years old.  I could wear them and I am not a kid except at heart!
2.0,Maybe I should have gotten a smaller size.
2.0,This purse is very cheaply made. I expected it to be somewhat of lower value considering the price but the stitching is badly done and the chain is so cheap I am scared to wear it for fear it will break. This purse was not worth it for the price.
2.0,The photos for this shirt are incredibly misleading.  They show an almost ombré sapphire blue to sea foam green transition.  In reality it is purple on the bottom abruptly transitioning to white and then another fast transition to turquoise.  Super disappointed.  The fit is weird too. The backing is pure white so the ombré is a machine effect rather than dye.
2.0,This sheds feathers like crazy. Continuously
2.0,"I expected the top to be fitted to my waist, then flair out (like in the picture) but that was not the case. The seam separating the top from bottom portions hit me mid-boob, making the flair out portion start well above my waist. It was not flattering, made me look pregnant. Maybe if I had no chest it would have fit better? Returning it was super easy though, so I'm happy for that."
2.0,Product runs much smaller and the zippers are backwards
2.0,I thought this would go with some of my dress shirts but it was just aight. Nothing that screams buy me! buy me!! Also I wish the seller gave some discount for volume purchase... like reduction on the shipping price especially when you buy like 6 of these ties at once.
2.0,Kid complained about difficulty to breathe due to suffocating stretchy fabric.
2.0,"This costume is very cheaply made for the price.  Even though it's not super expensive, I thought it would be made out of more durable fabric and not so thin/cheap feeling."
2.0,Unfortunately product not as I'd hoped
2.0,Omg! I really wanted this to work for a very special event I had. I’m a US size 14 or 1x hour glass shape. I ordered this skirt in navy blue and I sized up to a sz 16 just to be safe.<br />Unfortunately I could not fit but one leg in the skirt comfortably and I waited 3 weeks for it to arrive. I’m so disappointed.<br />The skirt is absolutely stunning! The good thing is my daughter who is a teenager sz 8 was able to fit it so I will altar it and let her hv it. She’s not into the long look but she loves the sequins.
2.0,the sizing was not what I expected. It was not slouchy like I wanted. Had to give it away. I would avoid this manufacturer.
2.0,Do not look like the one on the picture. I didn't like the material.
2.0,Disappointed.  Legs of these are long and fit great with room to spare BUT unfortunately crotch to waist area is too short and comes below the belly button.  I ordered 4 pair and am returning all but one that was worn..
2.0,"I want to love these shirts! I truly do! But after washing once,  they all came apart at the seams! 😢 they are a great material,  perfect length and fit,  but all came apart at different seams.  Uploading pics of one shirt for an example (see the upper part of the shirt,  one side apart at seams,  the other,  the strap is coming apart),  but happened to all. I was so excited to finally find a great long-length tank. Maybe I got a bad batch,  but so bummed!😢😢"
2.0,Good colors.. fit is off not long enough in the body..
2.0,"they were ok, the only thing I can say about this company's earrings.."
2.0,Hard for my daughter to walk in.
2.0,Very stiff leather.  I returned for the Frye Jayden.  Much more give in the leather.
2.0,To oversized nothing like the picture
2.0,"Very soft, but after washing in cold, the length lost  3 inches"
2.0,"Orders xlg so it would be a little baggy, but it was more like a petite large. Fabric is thin, also. The lace was the best part."
2.0,Ugly and cheap looking.
2.0,Purchased for my youngest granddaughter as a gift. Tiny but cute. I was very disappointed that no gift box was included. Now I will have to search for a nice jewelry box to wrap them in.
2.0,This top was returned. It was not flattering and it did not fit well. Very cute but it did not work out for me.
2.0,Very small for the size. I ordered up a size and it was still too small. I did like the colors and design.
2.0,Cute but too small to fit comfortably on an adult.
2.0,"Really wanted to love this, but one of the screws in the back fell out. Since it is labeled as Volkswagen OLM I was expecting better quality. The leather must have a plastic plate or something in it for the screws to grasp. Because they are not long enough to screw into anything else. So needless to say I’m still looking for another keychain, but this will do, until the other screw falls out."
2.0,"I was not happy with how it fit, and it took awhile to be shipped. Also I paid shipping, that I will not get refunded."
2.0,This product does NOT have a nose clip as advertised.
2.0,Thw post broke off after wearing them once.
2.0,I purchased these shoes for my 10 year old son  and  they were a little  too tight for my liking even thought purchased them.in bigger size than he normally wears. I wouldn't buy them again.
2.0,Great pattern. Unfortunately not an adult size.
2.0,Like the print and color but the fit and quality were not good.
2.0,"I am a size 12/14 depending on the manufacturer, so bought the XL. It fits as if I'd bought a size 10. Unless you are skinny, beware."
2.0,Style is not becoming in the back!!!  Had to send it back.  Sorry.  Liked the color and the front view.
2.0,The style is pretty but the dress is so shear I could see my skin through it
2.0,"These clip-ons have really big lenses. Depending on what you're looking for, that could be a good or a bad thing. They looked more or less as depicted, only larger. As far as I could tell they really are polarized lenses. The downside, one I couldn't ignore, is that the metal part that joins the clips to the lenses is really big. It poked me in the forehead. Between the lenses being larger than what would look flattering on me, and the clip poking me, I couldn't use these on my glasses. The do, however, fit over plastic frames. For fitting plastic frames and for apparently being polarized, they earn two stars. For how uncomfortable and unattractive they are, I returned them. Your mileage may vary."
2.0,"I measured my waist as they instructed. I ordered the size they requested for my waist measurement. Although it fit, it could have been much smaller. The zipper idea was not smart. Much like all zippers, it got stuck. It got hung up on the hook/clasp and got wedged. I tried everything to get it moving up or down, with no luck. In my attempts to get the zipper back on track, the teeth broke, and now the thing is garbage. I'll probably be ordering a smaller size for a better fit, and definitely with out a zipper.<br />Everything else was fine and made well."
2.0,"These sunglasses don't block the sun at all. If you're going more for style, they are really cute and high quality. Unfortunately for me, I was expecting  some sun protection. They shipped fast and arrived in good shape."
2.0,Length good but tight at chest and arms. Somewhat small and smell material is strong.
2.0,"This is obviously made in the US.  I am 5'3, 115lbs, but larger chest and a medium was pretty big.  I like the women's flannels to fit a bit better around the torso.  Material is very thin, not like a true flannel,  but more like a plaid shirt.  But a well made product.  Don't expect this to keep you warm for fall."
2.0,While I loved the cute design they did not hold up well and they broke after dropping them the first time. Not worth the money.
2.0,"It does not match the rose color of the Apple Watch. It is also very thick and definitely not suited for a ladies wrist. Probably be okay on man's arm and I also think the color might match a yellow gold watch. It was too much of a hassle to return and so I have decided to keep it and, who knows, maybe someday I will buy a gold colored watch, although, honestly, since  I don't wear a watch, the band may be re-gifted or donated."
2.0,"I got this ring for my dad and love the design but the sizing is not accurate! My dad wears a size 11 and I got him a size 13 because he's had other silicone run small and the size 13 was super tight. Unfortunately a 14 which is the biggest size, won't make much of a difference, so I have to return it now."
2.0,I love socks!!! However these socks are thin very comfy but will snag very easy.
2.0,"What I got was probably what I should have expected for the price. The fabric felt like a cheap Halloween costume and the legs would roll up my thighs immediately while the waist was kind of loose. I ordered Medium and I'm 5'7"" 140lbs. I'll be returning and spending a bit more for some shorts I will want to wear."
2.0,Too big in the chest. Didn't lay right. Disappointed.
2.0,"Definitely a weird fit. Bulky and square up top and way too short for my 5'6&#34; frame. The sides also have a very high slit so wearing it as a swim cover seemed ridiculous b/c my bum would hang out. I can maybe use it as a summer top with skinny jeans, but not sure. I wish I would have saved the packaging so I could return it."
2.0,Very cute however the tutu is coming attached and fraying after just 3 wears to dance class. A bit disappointing since now o have to purchase another. I bought this one specifically because it has short sleeves which seems to be hard to find.
2.0,I’m in the 23” inch range and these were just tiny. Not even close.
2.0,"Don’t get me wrong. This is a stylish jacket that’s fits the urban millennial style of 2019. Only problem with this product is that it was way smaller than their other jackets. I bought two of the same jackets just different colors both at LARGE. The green one fits like a large but the navy blue one fits like a medium. Both jackets are made from different material and have different zipper styles. So depending on what color you choose you will get a different material and size from the posted size you selected. Also on my green jacket, the zipper got stuck and won’t open but I can zip it up and put it on but can’t un zip it fully"
2.0,"I'm a white gold kinda gal, so when it showed up rose gold AND I had to pay the shipping to send it back?? Come on.."
2.0,"I loved this Cardigan, its beautiful but the smell is something horrible... It smells like burnt chemical smell. I have washed it 3 times and air dried it and it still smells awful. I cant even wear it"
2.0,Only one of the pairs didn't have a scratched lens out of the bag. With that being said I like the glasses. Wished the other weren't scratched.
2.0,Looks cheap. Purchased to see if I would buy for gifting to 30 plus and decided not to since the quality is poor.
2.0,I ordered this Grimm key soon after I watched the series finale of the show so I was very eager to get my hands on some Grimm memorabilia. I was immediately drawn in by the price and quickly placed my order. When I received my necklace I was not very pleased. It was considerable smaller than I expected it to be. In one of my photos I placed it next to a penny for size comparison. The craftsmanship of the key was also quite shoddy. The pattern only matches up when the actually key is exposed and when it is flipped back in it is very loose on the hinge and constantly exposes the key inside. The metal was also bent. I did give this 2 stars for the sole fact that I love the show and even though it was not exactly what I wanted it was still a part of the Grimm story.
2.0,"Nice cool cotton shirt good for tropical climates. Beware that these shirts run Small and you might want to go up a size or two. It's an ok shirt, but I won't be buying another."
2.0,Cute but definitely not 18g. I got them yesterday and so far have already lost 2 and never felt them fall out. I am used to occasionally losing one but that is over weeks of time. On the other hand they appear to be well made and sturdy as well as cute. Wish they were the right size
2.0,Beautiful watch however it fell apart after 30 days
2.0,"Like I said in the title,  yes it is a good looking apron and fits well.  BUT,  before I even got to the worksite the top pocket rivet came out when my cell phone was in it,  the stitching unraveled and my phone took a dive.  Fixed it for the day with a safety pin and sewed the pocket back into place when I got home.  I have  been using it every day on the worksite and all the stitching on the front pouch pockets have come loose and had to be sewn back.<br />The white thread is either old or weak and the stitching was not locked therefore all the stitching,  and I mean all has to be reinforced if your going to be wearing it for hard work."
2.0,I liked the color but I couldn't really feel the arch support. The nodules could have been higher through the arch.  Also the sizing isn't accurate. These were too big & too long by at least a half size to a full size. If you buy these I'd go half size down and maybe a full size if you have narrow feet and don't expect much Arch support.
2.0,Need tailor cut to  it
2.0,"I initially really liked this outfit when I first took it out of the package. The fabric is pretty soft and stretchy so I thought my daughter would really enjoy wearing it. I also liked that this same outfit is marketed under the brand &#34;Leighton Alexander&#34; (seen often on Zulily) for a much higher price so I was glad to get such a better deal here on Amazon. It didn't fade or shrink in the wash (washed and dried inside out) as far as I can tell. However when I put it on my daughter I noticed that the crotch is too short. The arms and legs are perfect in length but then the crotch is unusually mismatched so that everything bunches up in that area and pulls the top area down. It's just really odd fitting and I won't be putting it on her again. Even if a smaller baby were to wear this, the arms and legs would then be way too long so there's no fixing it, unfortunately.<br /><br />The snaps are plastic and one broke (near the bottom of the leg) after the first diaper change. So while this outfit looks cute, I would recommend not buying it. I don't think I'll be buying from this brand again."
2.0,These glasses broke within two weeks of getting them.
2.0,"I was looking to buy this for little girl but it was too thin. Its a beautifu bracelet but, aagain too thin."
2.0,Had for kids to put on by them selves
2.0,"I got these to go over the top of my masks just to add some fun and color and a bit more protection. But they were thinner than I thought they would be. They are so thin I can see my lips right through them. Again, I only plan on wearing them over a mask not alone.<br />But for those of you, that plan on wearing these without something underneath I don't recommend it. Always wear extra protection.<br />He loose strings are a bit annoying as well.<br />After trying them on just now I feel that they are very itchy for the fabric they are and are very uncomfortable.<br />As for the print it’s really nice and it went to the first wash just fine. I’m sure it will fade but so far it’s doing ok.<br />Thankfully we can wear them in many different ways."
2.0,"Color and fabric are perfect, but size is too small."
2.0,Within a couple days the bows on the side cane right off. Wouldn’t buy again.
2.0,Runs small in the ribcage
2.0,"Bought these for my wife. They were supposed to have come in gift packaging. Unless clear cellophane is now considered gift packaging I was deceived. Worst thing is they don't close securely. They're not a lot of money, but still too much for what you get."
2.0,"They feel so cheap and fragil; I got a feeling that they are not original, even the case was bad so I returned them not worth buying."
2.0,"Turns out my ears are too small for these to work. When trying to squeeze them tight, they broke😢."
2.0,"Watch out with these.  I bought them for my wife and after less than three (3) weeks they started falling apart.  The center turquoise is glued on and it just fell off.  They are useless now.  Also, the picture is somewhat deceptive.  The back of the earring is a flat separate piece of plastic and is not connected to the metal part of the earring so it flaps around.<br /><br />These are cheap and fall apart quickly."
2.0,Fits way smaller than size it says it is.
2.0,I bought a 4x when my daughter wears a 3xl<br /><br />It’s snug across her chest and belly
2.0,This shirt arrived wrinkled and I can’t get the wrinkles out. It also feels cheap.
2.0,I did order another suit... I'm hoping the next one fits as I order one size down from previoiusly.<br /><br />Thank you
2.0,These earrings are very cute and good for the summer. However I’m not sure about the quality of the material. Hooks started to get black at the first day. They arrived already with some black spots and got much worse after first use. See photo. I am not sure if metal is oxidising or golden plating peels of. Either way I have doubts that this is safe and hypoallergenic and I suspect that the rest of the earring may soon get dark as well. It must be all made of one material.<br />I was planning to buy different earnings  from this brand but now I’m not sure. Would be good to hear from manufacturer about this problem.
2.0,Was much too small in comparison to my regular size orders. Quite short as well. Material not great but ok for the price.
2.0,Dislike..material not cotton...very large..
2.0,The item received didn't look like the picture at all! I was so disappointed
2.0,I am regularly a size 4 and bought a medium. It fits perfectly  in the bust and shoulders and ends about 3 inches below my bellybutton. This is a shirt.
2.0,"I should have ordered a smaller size.<br />I washed mine on delicate and hung to dry.<br />Better to hand wash this item.<br />The lace is too thin and neck edge is already fraying , I haven’t even worn it!"
2.0,"Is this a maternity top?  This thing is made for a small-framed woman (narrow shoulders and small boobs) with an enormous belly.  The only way I can see that happening is during pregnancy.  The straps that are supposed to be kind of tank-top spacing actually attach closer to the center of my chest, either side of my sternum.  There isn't actually any push up aspect. It gives your boobs that very unified, matronly look.  Meanwhile, below the boobs, the tankini top billows out like a ball gown.  The moment you get in the water the huge skirt of a top is floating up all around you, revealing to midriff. Who wants that??"
2.0,Clip poor.  Cheap
2.0,"Cheap, not tunic length, shapeless"
2.0,Don’t recommend it
2.0,The elastic around the collar made it look like a part of clown costume in person.
2.0,"This necklace is really cute, and the price was wonderful. Unfortunately with the chains being connected it gets tangled all the time. I wouldn't buy it again."
2.0,As a North Face product I expected it to be warmer than this thin material.
2.0,The slots are a too tight fit for credit cards.  Business and appointment cards do not fit at all.
2.0,My son can't wear them because the strap is backwards and sown on so I am unable to place the strap the right way
2.0,"This blouse has no stretch at all and the sleeves are very small for this being a 2,x. I am a 42D, fit fine in this area but sleeves were right up in my armpit and tight, like a vise. Very hard to pull off because of no give in fabric."
2.0,The watch itself seems fine but the strap keeps coming off so my son doesn't use it as he is afraid of losing it.  Eventually we'll try to get the pin replaced to see if that helps.
2.0,Don’t see how these are useful. Unless you have implants and don’t need security. Lost the stickiness and flat out didn’t hold
2.0,Did not end up wearing as they are uncomfortable
2.0,Super loose around waste... not same as others purchased in past...
2.0,I usually read reviews but with this I didnt. The shirt was tight and the pants were long.  I suggest looking at other cocomelon outfits. If I would of ordered a size up the shirt would of fit but not the pants. It's cute and soft my little one wore it today but when I go to wash it I'm sure she wont. She saw me opening it and got excited so I couldn't return it.
2.0,I ordered a medium and It's kinda large. Just before I posted this I noticed that one of the sleeves is broken (See picture).
2.0,"Although the style is as pictured, the description is not entirely accurate. The hat is very loosely knit, not chunky as described. If you are looking for a hat that will keep you warm on a cold winter day, this is not it. It would be fine for a warmer day if you're just looking for a fashion statement. My main reason for the 2 stars however was because I ordered the dark gray to match a 2 tone light/dark gray winter scarf that I received for Christmas. The hat did not match either of the grays in the scarf as it was more of a mauve/purple tone. I was disappointed as that was not how it was pictured. I contacted the seller and although he offered me a $1.00 credit, was not understanding about my disappointment, telling me that color doesn't matter and does not affect the product. Well, I chose this color for a reason so it does matter. If I had known it wouldn't have been a true gray I would've ordered another color that would've at least complimented the grays of my scarf. This hat looks terrible against the grays. I will not be ordering another hat from this seller."
2.0,Cute but very cheap for the price. You can go to target and get nicer for the same price. Very light weight and feels like if you opened then too fast they may fall apart. I wear nothing but aviators.
2.0,"Not the usual quality. Some sort of sticky glue stuck on one side of the hat, tightly woven into the material, impossible to remove."
2.0,had loose strings lower quality than expected
2.0,Didn't see anywhere in the description that this was for small children. I should have measured the cape with the provided measurements. This cape sized for children under 6 or 7yo.
2.0,I ordered a large it fit comfortably and loose. I found it odd when it arrived that there were holes riveted into the shirt. I wore it with a grey tank and with in a couple hours of putting it on one of the rivets popped out.
2.0,"I was so excited for these, but when they came in I was very disappointed. For more than one reason.<br /><br />1. I did not receive all three colors, I got one blue, and two white/clear<br />2. The pictures make these seems very classy and gorgeous, and almost like a real jewel. In reality the stones look very cheap and plastic-like, and the white is more of a crystal than an opal.<br />3. One of the rings I got was faulty. One of the white/clear ones was faulty, the top ball wouldn't screw into the bar.<br /><br />Positive things:<br />1. Correct sizing<br />2. Timely shipping<br />3. Cheap price<br /><br />Overall I would've returned the product, but it wasn't worth the return shipping price. I wasn't happy with my purchase, mostly because I did not receive the third ring in black. I think if a product is advertised in such a way that it seems you would receive all three colors, you should get all three. I would've been perfectly OK with the cheap appearance of the materials had I received the three rings specified, and all of the products worked correctly/ without default."
2.0,The straps are too tight..uncomfortable.  my little one don't like them..
2.0,"These are children's gloves,  not women's gloves. They are very small."
2.0,I ordered this and was so excited to receive it. It arrived late and it was ripped and smelled of vomit. I had to wash it 3 times to get the smell out. It was tight along my chest and stomach. The stitching was poor and loose. You have been warned!
2.0,Not so good. I don't return much..Like 2 things every year... I had to return this.
2.0,the dress was beautiful but it run kinda of smaller
2.0,missing a stone (fake diamond) and I had to attach my own jump ring to fix a dangling chain in the middle of the necklace
2.0,"I love the print so I decided to try them.  They are horribly cheap feeling and the insole is not even attached to the inside.  I am really disappointed, but they came from China and took forever.  I’m sure I can’t return or I absolutely would."
2.0,Returning. Material ripped from the snap the first time I wore it. 😟😖😩Loved everything about it but the quality trumped everything else.
2.0,Looks very cheap and the pearls and crystals are huge make it look even more like cheap costume jewelry
2.0,Shrinks after the first wash
2.0,Just what I wanted and great price
2.0,"All in all, these glasses are ok, I've owned two pairs but I doubt I will buy another. The gold color was nice until it all rubbed off within a couple of months. I really want to love these sunglasses, but the truth is that you have to have an enormous head for these to fit properly. I'm a large guy with a Large size head (my hat size is 7.5) and these glasses fall off if I look down sometimes which gets really annoying. To make it worse I bought these mostly for motorcycle riding since they have great eye/face coverage and have a nice wrap around shape, but these glasses are so large and loose on my head that the wind will rip them right off if I turn my head or look down going any faster than 50mph (this happened to me once hence buying two pairs). I know these are designed with fishing in mind, but these are so loose they could easily fly off while riding on a boat or even while looking down into the water. If Filthy Anglers got the size a little more appropriate for most people I would definitely buy another pair."
2.0,I'm between a 1xl or 2xl but I got a 3xl because it run small. But didn't fit so I got gave it to a friend. But the black color is nice and looks like the pic
2.0,"Using the hand measurement guide I still ordered the XL.  The fingers barely make it to the ""V"" between my fingers and the thumb is so short that it does not allow for full extension.  I will be returning them."
2.0,"Fabric is rather thin, the sizes runs big and the flare is very pronounce, huge, more like bell bottom style. I returned it."
2.0,"I wanted to love this dress, but the fabric on top felt like sandpaper on my skin. Very little give to it and just not something I could wear for more than 5 minutes."
2.0,This is for the extremely slim women.
2.0,I wore one time and the seam split
2.0,Its a thick fabric so it doesn't flow. Which is opposite of what the picture looks like. Its short on me. Im 5'10&#34;. Im really not liking it. Will be returning on tuesday.
2.0,"Cheep, like cheaper than i expected for the price."
2.0,These are huge! They look like clown glasses. Took up half my face.
2.0,"Everytime I wear these, I have bruises and cuts on my shoulders for some reason."
2.0,Not a flattering top at all.  Not crazy over the design of the top.  I kept it because I had it for a while.  I bought it as a party top for a cruise but I was disappointed.
2.0,"My daughter really loved this watch, but it fell apart the second day she wore it.  She was so sad.  We are returning it."
2.0,"The color is nice,  but this tshirt is made of cheap polyester and seems to be a knock-off not what I expected"
2.0,No rhinestones on the shoe.
2.0,Work for two weeks after that no more ligths
2.0,Strings on the back ripped off the first month I had this romper. It sucks because it was super cute and comfortable
2.0,Purse is very small. Disappointed.  Can't get my wallet inside.
2.0,Desprende material de la cartera me cayo en el vestido que use y se notaba mucho porque era un color claro.
2.0,"Not a fan, not anything like the KSO made in China. Not comfortable and the high top rubs the back of my heel. Wore 2 times, and and lost some money buying them."
2.0,Majolica blue color of this piece does not match other samsonite majolica blue pieces. Very disappointed!
2.0,It was for a barber acerage 6ft tall ordered 2xl was way to short and tight did not fit made more for a woman or small man to bad because it was sharp
2.0,Worked good at first... then the strap became loose (lost its job elasticity) and water kept creeping in the goggles.
2.0,My daughter loved it until second week of school. The zipper broke and water bottle leaked.
2.0,Queda muy holgado y el material es muy simple
2.0,Somewhat small and cheap material but does the trick for a while anyway.
2.0,Can barely fit anything.
2.0,They don't stay in place and leave the top of my heel exposed.
2.0,Band very uncomfortable for a small wrist.
2.0,"I thought the beads were going to be larger, super tiny!"
2.0,After a few washes the material of the pant started to rip. I literally had to throw them away after I noticed the rear end was ripped. I only have the black one left since I bought the navy and black color and it’s slowly starting to lose its threads.
2.0,They are a bit chintzy. They feel stiff. Not very cottony. Fit is fine though.
2.0,This materials isn't real!.......It looks nice but will not last long and people can tell that is a fake. I didn't like the materials.
2.0,Lens seemed good but left bow came unattached and could not be reattached so they were returned.
2.0,"I needed this for my son’s PT, and I read the reviews and ordered a size up, but it was still really hard to get it over his head and torso. The PT ended up putting it on by him going up his legs and stomach. I ended up returning it"
2.0,Cute top but way too short. I have a short torso and the shirt didn't cover me completely as I would have liked.
2.0,"The overall quality of this bag was not worth the price charged. While I am certain that the proper bag was sent, it did not look quite like the one pictured. Even empty, the bag was kind of puffy rather than smooth and sleek as pictured. The straps were long enough for me to wear it over my shoulders when just wearing indoor clothing, however, it would not have been comfortable to wear over the shoulders when wearing a coat. Overall, the bag just seemed cheaply made."
2.0,"Not happy with the product. They fit tight, which is what I expected  but the back is lower than the front and I can’t pull it up any higher. Would not buy again."
2.0,My son ordered this and unfortunately didn't look at reviews. It is very very tiny. Not worth the money.
2.0,Very good looking watch but discolored too fast. Not a good quality watch.
2.0,"I've ordered from Gem Stone King in the past and have always been satisfied.  This item was horrible in every way.  The main problem was the large and ungainly clasp which didn't work right.  It was hard to open and hard to close, and the ring on the other side barely fit around it.  The white beads looked like freshwater pearls but the pink beads looked very plastic, like a child's cheap necklace.  The strands were large and ungainly, not delicate at all.  I didn't mind having to twist them myself, but I did mind that it looked like I had a pink and white sausage ring around my neck.  Finally, the workmanship was dreadful.  As if the clasp wasn't ugly enough, the cheap looking strings used for the beads were all sloppily knotted at the clasp, with straggly ends sticking out all over.  I have purchased a lot of necklaces at craft shows and I have never seen anything put together as badly as this.  Really Gem Stone King, if this were the first time I had ever ordered from you, it would be the last time!  Returned it."
2.0,"They are stylish & look great but not well made.  Hinge broke and are not fixable, we tried.  Brought to eye repair store who said would fix for about $50.  Disappointing quality but stylish, for sure."
2.0,"Did not hold the hair bands like I thought it would.  To be fair, I did read that this one was not specifically designed to do that; but was hoping for a cheaper option since the other hair band bracelets were more money."
2.0,The tag on the pj says 3T- 4T even though the advertised size is 4. It's a too snug fit for a size 4T boy- and that's before washing it. Have to purchase a larger one- maybe will try a size 5.
2.0,"The legs are too straight, since they don’t bend around glasses they fall off continuously. Didn’t work for me."
2.0,You get what you pay for. Nothing more than cheap flip flops...
2.0,"It was fine while it worked. It stopped working about 4 years of partial use.  Something this simple should work for more than 4 years,<br />I'm going to try to take it apart and see if I can fix it."
2.0,"I returned this item bc I needed a blush/light pink dress for a wedding and when I received the dress it was pretty but it was more purple then blush. The lace and the lining didn’t quite match. The liner looked way more purple, like lilac. I never tried it on bc it just wasn’t going to work for something as specific as a wedding, so I’m not sure about the fit but the color was definitely off."
2.0,"The dress was too large and not at all flattering, not on me at least. The material is uncomfortable."
2.0,These slippers are the most comfortable slippers I have ever owned. I thought they were comfortable when I first tried them on but once they were worn for a while they felt even better. They will be the only slippers I will ever wear.
2.0,It's okay. Purchsed as a gift for a bride. Backdrop does not hang as long as it appears in the photo.
2.0,My glasses kept falling off.
2.0,"I didnt like that it didnt have the large open area for money, it only had little pockets for cards."
2.0,"I suppose this item is made to be hemmed by the purchaser, but I did not see that stated in the description. The robe would fit a 7 foot tall person perfectly. It was also far too narrow and does not flow nicely. This product would be much better if the material was thicker and the robe was wider and much shorter."
2.0,They look used.  Didn’t even come with the box. For what they cost i assumed that they were new.
2.0,"Bought these for my husband for Christmas. Nice enough gloves, but the key was the touchscreen finger tips. And the tips stopped &#34;touching: before the end of winter."
2.0,Doesn't come on every time my purse is opened and not that very bright.
2.0,"IT DEFINITELY LOOKS BETTER IN THE PICTURE THAN IN PERSON. IT LOOKS A BIT CHEAP, AND MY BOYFRIEND DID NOT LIKE IT. WE RETURNED IT."
2.0,I ordered a large because in most clothes and dresses I am a large the large fit me like a shirt as you can see I kind of tucked it in a little at the bottom because it would not go past the middle of my butt I couldn’t even try to put leggings on to make it look alright it was just way to short but the length of the arms fit great especially considering the fact that I have really long arms and most of my problems are always with short sleeves
2.0,"The glasses didn’t improve my husband’s eye strain for computer work, and the company does not offer returns.  Guess we will donate them.  Buyer beware if they don’t meet your needs."
2.0,Had to rush out and buy another gift when this one arrived in the mail!  Tiny earrings seem suitable for a child.
2.0,"I bought this for a wedding and ordered my regular size (xxl), as per the sizing chart. The skirt part (pink floral) I liked a lot; however, the black top was not flattering- it looked like I was wearing a black sports bra with a skirt hiked up to my chest. The black top hardly covered my bust (I’m 40DD with a long torso). If the top was longer, I would have likely kept it- the material was comfy! The dress would likely be ok for someone with a small bust and short torso. I will be returning."
2.0,Does not look like the picture.  There is no slit on the side like it is shown in the picture.
2.0,The product doesnt really fit the picture look.. It's fleece on the inside and not tight around the ankles but too tight everywhere else
2.0,"I ordered these shirts (black/white pkg of 2) because they button up and I needed button front tops while I recover from breast cancer surgery. I was hoping 100% rayon would be silky on my skin. These, sadly are not silky. They are scratchy.<br />Also, they have been washed on gentle 3 times so far and hung to dry. Surprisingly, both shirts have the packaging folds and creases still in them. Having to iron them is ridiculous.<br />I would not recommend these shirts to anyone."
2.0,"Fastener screw/closer at the top came undone while I was in the shower, ruining the ashes of my husband.  I don't wear it now."
2.0,"Fabric is see-through and the size runs small.  I cut the tag out before I tried it on, otherwise I would have sent it back.  Love the cartoon, tho."
2.0,"Bought these glasses in an attempt to coordinate with any outfit. Some of the nosepieces were missing, some are smaller than others (and they look ridiculous on me) so I really only got a good 4 or 5 pairs out of this. Came in the colors advertised but had a lot of inconsistencies. I would stick with getting a bunch of $10 sunglasses"
2.0,These would be perfect if they provided some support
2.0,"This shirt is so cute however, the fabric is very stiff.  The colors are very bright but after one wash they are very faded.  Very disappointed."
2.0,Very pretty. But it broke the day after I got it
2.0,"Cute shoe but way too small, ordered the 18-24 month size for my 15 month old and they are about 1/2” smaller than his foot. Returning."
2.0,"I'm  not a huge fan of this suit. The material is very thin and the sizing is weird. I have a little 2 y/o guy (short and skinny). The arms of the suit were hanging on him, but it just barely fit him length-wise. I also don't like that the butt pilled very easily and the pattern isn't that cute IRL."
2.0,They are really cute but I only had a chance to wear it for less than 24 hours & it got snagged on my couch & just broke. The quality of the chain isn't that tough so if you decide to buy it be very careful wearing it because it won't last long. Kinda disappointed
2.0,"After I washed it, the down all clustered into rocks. I needed to manually loose the down. It has bad smell and it isnt water repellent."
2.0,"They are cute. And they would have fit perfect, but the top hello kitty accent on one shoe was almost completely peeled off when I received them. It's almost comical! DO NOT BUY THESE. Plenty of others have mentioned a similar problem."
2.0,Love the look of the dress but very short and I’m only 5”2!
2.0,"I ordered the Enimay jeggings for plus size women, and I did not get them at all. Instead, I received a small pair of dark Enimay leggings"
2.0,Very lightweight material - a little cheap bu good enough to wear with jean shorts for summer
2.0,"Only 2 of the 6 backings fit. The other 3 have too big of holes for the front to screw into. And one of the backs came broken. Pretty design but cheap.<br /><br />Update: I wish you could give half star ratings. I would rate these 1.5 stars. After one day, the gauges started to smell. And it wasn't my ear. It was the plastic. So I cleaned up my ear and the gauges. The plastic smelled weird again in a couple days so I cleaned it again. But now I can't screw the fronts off. They are stuck."
2.0,The shorts were way to small I followed the guide and it still was to small I'm 5'2 114 pounds I ordered a 38 so it can be a little loose but nope it was so small.
2.0,"I'm glad I read the reviews, this items runs extremely small. I ordered a size up and I barely got them up."
2.0,It's cute but definitely shorter than the picture and there's little fringes hanging off where the seam is. Worth it for four bucks but wouldn't suggest paying any more than that.
2.0,They may work really well if they are used in shoes not designed for a child that likes to run around a lot.
2.0,"Really like it, but the tree charm fell off after a few days."
2.0,"I was very hopeful when ordering this dress. I even ordered a size bigger. I have lost 35 lbs and wanted a flowing dress. Well, this dress fit me so tightly that I looked like a stuffed potato. Bulges everywhere. And I bought a bigger size than I am. I am hopeful that it will eventually fit me when I lose more weight."
2.0,the fit is weird and the design on the leg makes it look like a cowboy's pants. the colour was also richer than the pic which i was not very happy about
2.0,The top rides up all the time. I wore it a few times and had to discard.
2.0,Super weird fit.  Immediately donated it.
2.0,"I had a pair of heart shaped sunglasses that I loved dearly but lost. I was looking to replace them with this pair but when they arrived I was so disappointed. They look super cheap, like $1 bin at a discount store. They looked so terrible on, almost like ovals, you can hardly tell they are heart shaped unless you look up very closely. The only thing I did like about them was that the lenses were very dark, otherwise I felt like an 11 year old going to their first Warped Tour in them. No offense to 11 year olds."
2.0,Ok...not for adults
2.0,"Good structure. Material seems nice enough quality, but has a strong odor so I returned it."
2.0,"Nice looking and good quality, but the only problem is kingdom is spelled wrong on the cross"
2.0,"Wife not impressed, came in a vacuum sealed bag, very thin and ver wrinkled."
2.0,"Addendum to this review:  the second pair I received is made of lycra, not cotton. I don't particularly care for that type of fabric<br />Otherwise they are the same. I ordered the shorts with and without the pocket.  The shorts without the pocket seem to be made of softer fabric.  The shorts with the pocket (big enough for a large cell phone with case),  seems to be made with thread that is rougher at the seams ( minus one star).  I ordered an XL and normally wear size 16 and I am 5'4"".  The length comes to just above the knee.  The waist fits just above the belly button. They machine wash and dry well.  They do fade over time.  I love these shorts and wear them with a longer T Shirt and tunics."
2.0,Big hat but overall but didn't fit my head
2.0,Sizing is waaaay off! Way to small.
2.0,The product runs  small and the company has no return policy.
2.0,Falling apart after just a couple of wears.
2.0,This product did not work for me. This brands glasses are blurry with my eyes. The optics seemed off.
2.0,Love the fabric but cheaply made. No dart at the breast so it gapes and I had to sew it. Great for stinking hot weather.
2.0,Did not fit kids face well -ages 5-11
2.0,Pretty as the picture but it’s broke 3 times and can not hold my keys due to the weight.
2.0,Had to return them. Extremely tight around the neck.
2.0,I was looking forward to this item so much that I have decided to purchase again. I expect to receive the correct size! The item I ordered was a 32 waist size and when received the label was obviously incorrect because I gifted the to a friend who could wear them and his waist size is 40.
2.0,"Was really searching for a high impact bra I could use for running or cardio. I’m a 32DDD and I ordered a medium but it was even a little big. It’s super cute and I would have loved for it to fit and be what I wanted, but it just wasn’t."
2.0,Very cheaply made. Not worth it.
2.0,"To heavy, to small"
2.0,Shrink after washing
2.0,I ordered gray bag and the item i received wasn't gray. It was light brown. The top of the bag was caved in and couldn't get straightened out.
2.0,"I use these as headbands for running, the stretch on these is way too loose!"
2.0,"The vivid blue color of the top faded after the first wash. For the price, I expected the top to last for at least a few wears and not fade so quickly. Would not purchase again."
2.0,"Too wide around the ankles, not a very flattering look and unlike other shoes of the same style that I've seen at stores. Also, I ordered &#34;black&#34; and they sent me &#34;black ts&#34; which in the picture is a matte leather, while the one I ordered looks like a more shiny leather with a brighter silver zipper. Not very happy with this, but they were cheap so maybe I'll wear them."
2.0,Loved the dress way to small.  Runs very small
2.0,"It fits but seemed I’m a bit too tall for it, I’m only 5’4"
2.0,Don’t like the feel of these leggings.
2.0,I ordered an XL and it was too tight. XL is my normal size but this shirt runs small unfortunately had to return it
2.0,The pants are awful no stretch what so ever! The material for the pants are totally different from the shirt it feels like burlap material. The top is cute and stretchy. I had to buy different pants so my grandbabies could wear the top.
2.0,It's ok it falling apart ready.  It would be a nice hat if the sewing was better.
2.0,"Putting these earrings in were one of the most frustrating 30 minutes of my life. They are SO DIFFICULT to close even when done backward. You really get what you pay for honestly, they're cheap for a reason. On the bright side they sent me 4 pairs instead of 3 sooo that would be great if I were able to use them without wanting to kill myself."
2.0,They keep falling off definitely don’t try to use your phone
2.0,Cute but broke very quickly
2.0,"Dont buy the yellow one, its completely see through"
2.0,"These socks are very thin and when putting them on, the fabric stretches too far, leaving bare spots in the material. They did, however stay in place, just a cheap material."
2.0,DOES NOT LOOK LIKE PHOTO. VERY CHEAP FINISH
2.0,No me guato
2.0,The material was unattractive and very plastic.
2.0,It's not the best skirt. It's made out of cheap material that loses color easily but it did fit as expected. It also wrinkles right away
2.0,I ordered a size med. It was too small. The material is not flattering at all. Very poor quality. I would not recommend buying.
2.0,"Super unflattering. Bulky & high shoulders, very boxy."
2.0,"Okay, the cute in the front is super short. Maybe for a younger girl wanting to flaunt it....  loved the color and the idea, but had to return it."
2.0,It was tent like. I returned it.
2.0,"The print is really pretty, however thats the only good thing about it, its larger than I expected, though that is my fault  for not checking the size , I assumed it was smaller but the zipper quality is very poor, Which is true also for the bag I bought with the same pattern. Overall would not recommend.  The pattern does not make up for the poor zipper quality."
2.0,The fabric is too shiny and it runs very large.  I ordered it for my daughter who wears a small and it fits me well and I typically wear a large.
2.0,"A lot of people said the zipper did not work or was difficult to use, others did not so I took a chance and no my zipper did not work! Nice looking coat but I returned."
2.0,It looks good and it kept great tiem for 2 days then for no reason it stopped working. I wound it both times and the spring has plenty of tension.
2.0,I ordered my daughter her size for the US and only used it on her bday... it was just too small for her  it was a at very minimum 1/2 a size to small if not a full size..
2.0,I really wanted to love these. Right out of the package they fit great and felt great. They were the perfect length. I was so excited that I had finally found the perfect pair of pants. But then I washed them. Even though I washed them according to the directions they still shrank in the length. So now they are about three inches too short in the leg. Super disappointing and I can’t return them .
2.0,I am 5 feet and 4 inches tall. I bought small size dress. It is too long in length. The dress fits fine but it is just too long. I did not like it.
2.0,looks cheap - you get what you pay for
2.0,The product was photographed as if it took up a good 6-8 inch space on the neck area like a jabeau. It arrived and is no more than 4.5 across.<br /><br />If you’re tiny size 5 or you want a string-tie effect it’s fine. But for a size 12 person like myself the effect is totally different— not nearly how it was presented on mannequin. Also the pin part is just glued on in back. Not great. Just so so.
2.0,None of the buttons work
2.0,I am 5’5 and 135 pounds usually west a medium. This was too tight with no stretch I wish I got a large
2.0,All digital functions of this watch stopped functioning in the 1st 30 days!
2.0,"The dress was not cut straight across the front. It dipped down below the belt line, so it made my daughter look like she had a belly."
2.0,"Size was smaller than expected, didn’t fit and was too narrow"
2.0,"This would have been adorable IF my ta-tas had been the size of a pair of nickels or clementine oranges, but alas, my modest B sometimes C gals were not able to cram into this top. Would be really cute for someone with an A cup."
2.0,"Arrived tarnished. Although cute, if arrived tarnished I don’t think it would hold up to everyday use so I returned it."
2.0,This hat is much smaller than I thought. It was for my father. He either has a bigger than the average head but it barley fit my mom too.
2.0,"My 9 yr old son liked it, hence the 2 stars...but it's not worth the price...I really wanted to like it but the soccer ball on the front and the name & number on the back look like stickers, literally. The material is also very thin. So far I have washed it 3 times but have not wanted to put it in the dryer bc I have a feeling that the stickers will come off. I ordered another customized jersey & short for half the price here on Amazon and the quality is sooo much better...that's when I realized that this is just not worth it, plus you have to pay for shipping so it ends up being a $40+ jersey...not worth it in my opinion when there are better choices on Amazon."
2.0,They are good as liner socks and that's just about where it ends. Your feet will freeze if you were these socks alone in 50 degree weather.
2.0,Nice looking but it’s hard to believe it’s real leather. The purse has a bad odor to it.<br />The inside of the purse is cheaply made.<br />Great purse for a teenager I guess.
2.0,I’m usually a medium but this one was a little too small. It was nice so I was sad it didn’t fit.
2.0,"It's funny because the nose and lips are so huge,  it doesn't line up with a normal sized face.  I was looking for something thinking it would line up a bit more. If you want something to look somewhat real,  this isn't for you.  It's too disproportionate. The print is clear though."
2.0,Sent back because the closure wouldn't work
2.0,It looks good outside but as you put things in it it comes off its hook and remains open.Bust bust
2.0,Strange material and much smaller than anticipated.
2.0,Not black. More like a dk brown
2.0,"For a Hexarmor product, this one I would not recommend. I work in an industrial setting that requires spoggles anytime your in the plant  and these have been more of an aggravation than anything and went back to my cheap pair and gave these away. The strap system utilized on these are horrible. The plastic snaps will constantly come unhooked. You’ll spend more time fighting with them than anything. The lenses are great and they are comfortable but just the strap alone, I recommend buying an different style atleast until HexArmor changes the design."
2.0,Didn't fit like I expected it to<br />Very cheap material<br />I'm looking into returning mine<br />Size runs smaller than usual<br />See through
2.0,Very poor quality. Straps keep sliding down.
2.0,"Shirt material is good, fits decent, definitely NOT an athletic fit though, worst aspect is the collar cheap material and form that will start to curl after just a couple washes"
2.0,"Fit as expected, but I wasn’t a fan of the material, was expecting more of a sweatshirt material and it is more of a shiny polyester material that came."
2.0,"Nice product, size chart is way off."
2.0,Fell apart at the seams after a few uses.
2.0,"These were fine for a while. Then I took them camping and (presumably?) from being left out in the cold, they shrunk about 4 sizes and I was unable to even get my feet in them anymore."
2.0,"Unfortunately, this didn't work out for me. The color (I ordered purple) is bright and cheerful, and the material is thick and stretchy. But, the torso is fairly short, and as a busty woman (30FF), the waist of this sat way too high and looked like a baby doll dress. I would recommend this for smaller-chested women, though!"
2.0,Easy to use the product since all you do it twist and put it in your shoe. Didn’t last long for what it claim. Not really effective and would rather buy another product
2.0,Nice material and LOVE the look!! I’m sad that I’ll be returning mine because I didn’t realize there’s no pocket. A hoodie isn’t a true hoodie without the pocket. I also where a men’s medium or large in hoodies and this is a xxl. Order up 2 sizes for sure.
2.0,The measurements doesn't even match.
2.0,"I was so excited for this and it was a big disappointment. I normally wear size 16/18 so ordered the xxl figuring it would run small. To compare, this fits like an old navy large shirt. I wear xl in old navy. Also, this is very thin and oddly shaped in the shoulders and arms. If you’re super skinny this may be ok."
2.0,"As soon as I saw the boots I asked my son NOT to wear them outside on the farm. Could tell that they were definitely NOT waterproof snow boots. Said that he could wear them as church boots. Second time wearing them at church (on carpet, inside) the toes tore up. I guess I shouldn't have expected much for the cheap price."
2.0,Ended up giving these to my niece.
2.0,"Although this is a cute dress, it is not very well made. The biggest issue is it is too short waisted."
2.0,"Too small not worth it, yes get a bigger size for my fellow bigger sized people."
2.0,I don’t know how to attach them to make them stay on and not slide around on my shoe while walking. There isn’t even a view for the seller to show how it’s supposed to be worn. It’s cute but difficult.
2.0,Gshock quality but would not buy again . Reverse light is not bright enough. Can only read time outdoors in sunlight
2.0,I placed the order for large but received XL.  Regardless the XL was more like a 2XL. The shorts are very light weight and cheap. The drawstring looks like it will not last.
2.0,"Not only are they too large without much elastic in the waist, Beltoutlet only accepts returns if you pay the shipping.  Would not have bought  them had I known that."
2.0,"This is a very cute sweater, but way too short to wear it as a dress as pictured.  My daughter is very petite and wears a double zero in clothing and it was too short for her.  It fit like a regular sweater, not a dress."
2.0,"Runs really big in the cup. Unfortunately my daughter has an extremely athletic build, but isn’t very chesty. I’m in the process for a return to size down!! Hopefully it works!"
2.0,"The quality is good, but the adult size mask is so small that the only person who could wear it was my 8 yr old.  Smallest mask I have ever seen.  So disappointing, and cannot recommend that any adult purchase this mask."
2.0,Credit Cards slip in fine. Standard feel and look but they have a matte and textured finish where it makes it hard to read thru it. I would not recommend these due to that. They smell ok.
2.0,Didn’t work was broke when received it .
2.0,"Very Very Very small, this is a bag only for sample or small travel products."
2.0,The top was 2 small for me and pants were a little big. Beautiful if you have a small top
2.0,Broke not even 1 hour of wearing them
2.0,"This fit me as a shirt unfortunately, I ordered an XL"
2.0,"I wrote a positive review of these when I first got them after only having tried them on my daughter. I first ordered the pink suede, but those had a defect so I sent them back and reordered the caramel leather. She’s had them six days and worn them four of those days, always indoors on our hardwoods. She is 18 months and always walking, no longer crawling. While they look fine from the top, the toe of the left one is already badly scuffed. She’s had other moccasins that I bought on Amazon for much cheaper than these and that she crawled in that took months for the toes to get like this. I went with this brand this time because I liked that they’re made in America. The others were made in China and the leather always had a strong chemical smell. I wanted to love these because they’re gorgeous, but the price was way too high to have this happen after four wears."
2.0,I ordered a medium and the neckline cut off way too low. My boobs are fully exposed by the mesh part. I love the color and the fabric has a nice silky texture but the fit is terrible and there are already strings hanging out along the hem.
2.0,Other sunglasses in the picture!
2.0,I bought 2 sets for my upcoming vacation. I ordered a large which is the size I normally wear. The pants fit weird baggy in the top front area and tight everywhere else. The shirt is also very snug. The fabric does not stretch at all. Looks like I'm wearing my old pj's for my trip.
2.0,"I love the pattern, a little too small. Hope I will loose a few pounds."
2.0,Not impressed..
2.0,"Really cute. However I like wearing the strap and it holds onto the suit with a metal piece. For the love of God, it digs into your skin. Looked into having it sewn on permanently. Told that swim material is tricky to sew and it may look uneven due to the size of the straps."
2.0,regifted it
2.0,Sadly my grand daughter is 8lbs and this outfit swallowed her. So if you have a baby that is 8lbs then do not purchase this and think it will fit right.
2.0,these are cut too small and I CAN NOT RETURN BCAUE I have thown away all paperwork. very dissapointed
2.0,Came on time nice fit! However I bought this as a gift and was really embarrassed that there was no button hole had to physically cut one!
2.0,Some of the ear rings were to thin at the top causing the to break
2.0,The sewing seams are terrible- Uneven/ wavy. Looks cheap. I was disappointed and returned them..
2.0,"way too small and I ordered Xlfor my husband,, too tight no way to get them on him.  Pretty colors and jazzy, but that s about it. returning them."
2.0,"Returned this product. It was not made well, bunched in an unattractive way around the waist & hips and did not fit length-wise. Too long to be capris too short for boots. Possibly an anomaly."
2.0,I went to wear this bra for the first time a couple weeks ago and it ripped right out of the underwire! Very disappointed!
2.0,"File this one under  - you get what you pay for. colors were good and length was good but it was as thin as tissue paper and the elastic on the top was only partially sewn. Luckly, I bought it on Amazon prime so I will be returning it without any hassle!"
2.0,Loved the bling of the butterfly but the material is a cheap plastic type shiny. The pearl strap broke during the first use so I threw the whole thing out and bought a better one .
2.0,"while I *loved* the picture of the pink bag on the listing, when I got it I had the same problem as several others that the coloring was wayyy off. when I got mine, there were also 2 dark spots on the bag where it looked like a grey liquid had been spilt. even though I was slightly disappointed with the color and the small stains, I was determined to use it. I removed the stains with my stain remover pen and used it for a few days and met me tell you, this is probably one of the most uncomfortable bags I've ever used. the straps seem to be super cheap, as well as the outer fabric of the bag itself! the inside is very nice looking, but carrying this bag around made me feel like I bought one of those do-it-yourself bags you buy at Michael's to decorate at birthday parties.<br /><br />tl;dr- this bag is not worth the 20 dollars and you can buy a better one at Walmart in sale with better quality!"
2.0,I love the color and the simple design but soon as I put it on it fell off!!!
2.0,Too long. I’m 5’10” and it is longer than the model shown. Awkward length. Nice heavy material though
2.0,"Top was a bit big and the bottom is way too small. It's nice fabric and print, just wish I could actually wear it."
2.0,"The dress is beautiful, love the fabric. However, I am typically a size M I ordered a L because of the reviews and this dress was still insanely small, could not zip up even halfway and the sleeves were tight and short. if the sizing was correct it would be great."
2.0,I would not buy a Russell sweatshirt again.  I bought one a few years ago and it was great but this seems to be about half as thick and does not provide the warmth of the first one I bought.
2.0,"Product arrived broken, cute tho."
2.0,Material is strange rough stretch material. A little see through.
2.0,Too tight in the arms but was big enough
2.0,The top and bottom were too small. But the fit in some areas and not the other.
2.0,"I ordered this and another smaller pack (laptop bag) at the same time. Both arrived on time all though one was supposed to be delayed. The packs are presented well, both came in a nice little drawstring bag. However, that's where the niceties ended.<br /><br />The pack descirbed here had a couple issues: the hardware at the ends of the shoulder strap that connect to the bag were both broke, and one of the loop that the shoulder strap connects to was in the wrong location (was located on the bottom, didn't make sense).<br /><br />For the smaller pack, one of the side pouches was missing the zipper device (the piece that you pull to open and close it) and was zipped shut with out it.<br /><br />These issues aside, if you get one without the defects, they seem to be good quality.<br /><br />Waiting to see what happens next, will update on new order."
2.0,"They’re not too tight, but they slide down, despite being high waisted. Especially when you bend. The pockets are a good size but using them adds to the creeping down. The material is thick. I bought two pair. The grey were longer and more flattering than the black. I only wear them around the house."
2.0,"I'm regularly a large, however my experience with buying clothing from companies in Asia (specially China, Japan, Korea, etc), has been you always need to purchase a size or 2 bigger as they run small so I did, I bought XL.  Not sure if the labels were wrong but this shirt (and I bought all 5 colors)didn't fit at all, I couldn't even button it up.  The linen (if in fact it is linen) felt and looked cheaper than any other linen shirt I've ever owned.  The design of the shirt was nice but the fabric and the size didn't work for me."
2.0,"Was expecting a better quality glove. I’ve been surging for a warm winter glove that will last, stay warm, and work with my phone. Not impressed."
2.0,The stitching on mine started coming apart the first day that I received it. and the pictures make it look like distressed vintage leather mine is however smooth suede looking.what an absolute disappointment. It is however pretty comfortable right out of the box. I ended up buying a collareb that I am very pleased with.
2.0,"There is definitely distortion at the lower end of the glass.  It is not a huge deal for me as I use these only for biking. It only annoys me when I look down at my watch.  They are not very dark, which I like."
2.0,CHEAP MAKE
2.0,This is a pretty bracelet but it keeps coming apart at the clasp. I guess you get what you pay for so it was worth that.
2.0,This was my second order the first order fit good but the second order fits a lil to snug i need a bigger size.
2.0,"The waist is not accurate. Buy at least one if not two sizes up.  Also, it doesn't state it but these are slim fit/skinny jeans. Returned."
2.0,wtf is this 🤣
2.0,The pendant is beautiful but the chain can’t hold the weight of the pendant .. 2 chains already broke
2.0,"Today, I wore this hat for the first time.  Well, I TRIED to wear it.  As soon as I attempted to place it on my head snugly, the velcro attachment pulled out from the cap.  Then, I noticed that none of the stitching had been properly tied and terminated, so the hat band was beginning to unravel.<br />Very poor workmanship.  Though the hat looks good.. I had it fixed on a sewing machine, the warning was DO NOT WASH THIS CAP. It will likely fall apart."
2.0,"The Hoodie is perfect, orher than the sayings on the arms both say the same thing wich should not be the case, one cold, one hot, but they both say cold."
2.0,These where simply too small
2.0,The Cocoon Grid-it is better.
2.0,Cute but Stone fell out within one month
2.0,"I only had it for short time before the buckle broke. I really liked it too.<br />I put a piece of leather on it to use now but I have to tie it on my wrist.<br />I do like how it screws on and when you put oil in it, it smells great for days.<br />I just wish the band would of been better.<br />First picture shows the buckle, 2nd picture shows how I wear it now. I don’t want to return them because my daughter has the black band one."
2.0,"Like the watch, it's just extremely small, I don't even have a huge wrist and this looks ridiculous on me."
2.0,This shirt fits incredibly small. My son only got to wear it once before having to hand it down to his much younger brother.
2.0,Lucia muy simple y mal acabado de las costuras . Lo devolví
2.0,"Little cute strap BROKE, the 3rd time I wore them. Loved them until then. Received as a gift but I picked them out. (fuzzies on glove are from trying to photograph on my carpet...)"
2.0,"When these earrings arrived, they are beautiful BUT 1 of the crystals was placed backwards.  I had to stretch the clasp to remove the crystal and put it in the correct way, I’m sure that doing this made the earring fragile to breakage.  That’s why the low stars."
2.0,"The photo of this is misleading; there is very little shaping to this dress. It pretty much hung straight from the bust. Also, the measurement chart for the solid colors must be way off. I am 5’8”, 38D with a narrow waist; according to the chart I needed a large. It was enormous on me and very unflattering. I was so disappointed because the color is beautiful and the fabric felt like it would be really nice to wear on hot humid summer days. Oh well. I’m debating sizing down to a small to see if that will fit me. If I do and it does, I’ll update my review with more size information."
2.0,"Dress is obviously used. It has rips, stains, and the tag has been ripped off. Not to say that this is a consistent problem, but the quality control is terrible."
2.0,"The garment was extraordinarily small, more like an XS than a medium based on US standards."
2.0,The ring was broken when I received it....<br /><br />I tried to put it back together with E6000 glue (a magical glue that's industrial standard) but it fell apart again...
2.0,I bought a large and can't even get my legs into these. These Run way small.
2.0,Look cheap material.
2.0,"Cute gnomes, but there’s a band along the bottom that makes this shirt very tight! Not a sweatshirt, it’s a shiny type material."
2.0,I don't really like it
2.0,only 6 colors..not at all like what is shown
2.0,Not gold colored at all and feels like cheap material
2.0,"It didn’t look like the picture on. Cut seemed somewhat off/different from what is in the photo. Haven’t had a great experience ordering dresses from Amazon, no fault of this vendor. Some came used looking, some came wet, some came in no packaging without tags, some of the fabric was different and some look nothing like the photos."
2.0,"The material feels nice.. But it is a regular top.. The one in the picture looked much nicer than what I got. However, I can wear it to the supermarket or somewhere..."
2.0,I LOVE the suit if only it fit. I'm not fat or wide but the top is made funny so when you put it on it doesn't hold your boobs in place and spreads them apart and makes for a TERRIBLE fit. I'm still trying to figure out how to alter it so it will work... its been a few months now.
2.0,"I returned this item. It fit in the bust, but belled out way to far at the hips. The color was also atrocious. Much, much brighter and more florescent looking than the picture makes it appear."
2.0,Very flimsy bag. Unless it’s packed tight. Would have liked it to be more sturdy on its own.
2.0,Fit tighter than expected.
2.0,I like the design but I'm disappointed because the mask is way too big.
2.0,"I was looking forward to this shirt but a12 month is more like a 6 month. Also it don't look like the pic it a very light purple which I don't care for. The only good thing about is the saying of course, and gave them credit for good packaging."
2.0,the inside ridge of the ring is uncomfortable. the ring feels better inside out. if you beveled the ridge and decreased the thickness it would feel much better. Also the set that I received has a poor color swirl you can not tell it was meant  to be camo
2.0,Plastic broken from regular wear after two weeks.
2.0,Looks cute but the fabric around the waist puffs out
2.0,Disappointed quality..started torning.. no good support for the foot
2.0,I like the hat but I cannot see through the plastic.  Yuck
2.0,Bottom and sides scuffed. Had a size 2 tag but were size 3 and huge for a 3 even.
2.0,"I was expecting glass lenses like the originals. Nowhere in the description does it say they are planstic. Coloring of the lenses is similar to original lenses, but not exact. The lense tint is also noticeably lighter, even though the lenses are supposed to mimic the factory lenses. I have the RB 3342 with the grey green polarized lenses. Positives, the lenses are clear, they fit well in the frame, they are lighter in weight, significantly decreasing the weight of the glasses."
2.0,"Bottoms are OK, but top is not that nice at all. the back of the bathing suit keeps riding up and it is lose."
2.0,"Well...<br />Unfortunately for me, the pants ripped right open like wrapping paper mere minutes into my first use. Now I suppose if I had only been walking things would've been fine, but what I do requires bending, crouching and climbing, which is how the almost immediate breakage occurred.  I had a size that was just a bit big on me, which I typically choose to allow for extra mobility.  So the pants get 1 star, and it's possible I may have gotten a defective pair, though there were no visible defects on arrival.<br />The jacket however turned out to be great for my needs, and that bumps my rating up to 2 stars. If it lasts a while, I'll add one more.  The jacket is long, so I won't need the pants quite as bad.<br /><br />So, how mobile you need to be should be the most important factor in considering this item. If you're a crossing guard, this would be a good investment, as it provides excellent visibility and is indeed waterproof."
2.0,The wig we received was too small for my adult special needs daughter.  That didn't really go over well at all.
2.0,I thought it would make putting my watch on easier.  But it is very cumbersome.  With the clasp open it will not fit over my hand.  It looks great when it is on though.
2.0,cute but way bigger that that usual size. Costs to much to send it back so ware it around the house cleaning.
2.0,They looked good on my girl but they are most definitely not fleece lined at all and it’s a bit disappointing seeing as that was the reason for purchasing them for my girl definitely needs to be what the product description says it should be otherwise it’s false advertising
2.0,Weirdest fitting oddest shaped quarter length sleeved cardigan ever.
2.0,Cheap looking for the price.
2.0,"While the overall quality of the sock material and sewing was fine, I didn't think they were anything high-end.  Additionally, I think they are really off in calling them Kingsize.  The sizing is even up to matching DXL products. They run small both in length and ability to fit wide calves.  Just missed being able to return them or I would have with no further purchase."
2.0,I wanted to like these but the fabric is super thin and poor quality.
2.0,"The cushions are comfy but you really can’t lean back because it isn’t sturdy. I was hoping for something I could lean on so my back wouldn’t hurt sitting on bleachers but this really doesn’t do the job, unfortunately."
2.0,"I am disappointed with this product. $20 pants with a hole in the pocket. Wish there were a way to contact the seller directly for these defective pants but that doesn’t seem to be an option through Amazon for a partial refund. Otherwise, I like the orange color, the fit, and the feel. But the quality control is lacking."
2.0,It arrived broken & tangled.
2.0,"Previously I ordered the crew socks in a size small and they were perfect.  The ankle socks were much to large.  I assume the packages were mismarked.  I am very disappointed since it is very difficult to find socks that are small enough for my 5 1/2 women shoe size.  I would like very much to purchase these socks in the proper size.  I did not want to rate these socks because the crew socks would get a high rating.  I also really like the thinness of these running socks, since I have a wide foot and cannot tolerate thick socks in some of my shoes."
2.0,Too short. I am 5’6” and these hit mid-calf. They look silly on me. Gave them to my shorter daughter
2.0,"I gave this a 4 previously but I just have to mention that I bought these twice bc I lost one from the first set. The first set I give a 1! The second pair they sent weren’t as long and they were thinner also. I was disappointed bc I thought they’d be exactly the same. Not so. I really loved the first pair. I don’t even wear the second pair now. And, there goes my idea of purchasing more for Christmas gifts."
2.0,"The shrimp has red eyes and doesn't look as neat as on the picture, I still quite like it though but not what I was looking for...."
2.0,Muy lisa la suela al caminar se resbala
2.0,"simple metal , not best quality"
2.0,"Not true to size, I usually buy an XL to have it a little baggy and not skin tight. Doesn’t look the picture, it looks similar but not the same. It’s not long. The middle leopard part resembles more of a work out pant material. The black and grey are thicker than what it appeared to be and does not flow like seen."
2.0,Broke 14  months from putting them in my Rocky boots.  cannot handle the military speed lace setup
2.0,This says Women's in the description but it's really for a little girl! So extremely small. Buyer beware of this one if you are not ordering it for a little girl.
2.0,"Cute sandals, love the look, but a little bit too large for a size 6.  Ordered the sandals on 2/16/22 and just got them in yesterday (4/8/22)."
2.0,"Fit as expected but still a little tight. Did not prefer the fabric it was made out of. The blue color looked classic and pretty. Not something I would wear to bed since it’s not comfortable. Otherwise, the style was nice and modest. If I were to reorder it, I’d get the next size up."
2.0,I wore these slippers sparingly for about a year. The stitching has already started to come out on both of them
2.0,"As an Amazon Reviewer, I’m sorry to say that I can’t Review the Crystal Teardrop Earrings because, I received a little Bronze colored Wing Bracelet instead. All I can say about the Crystal Earrings is, I wish I Had received them to Review because, I think they’re quite pretty from the pictures. I’m sorry I can’t help anymore than that.<br />  I can say that I have received a different set of Earrings that Umamebet made, the makers of this product and they are Very beautiful. Enjoy!"
2.0,"Too small, zipper doesn’t work well, no support."
2.0,The 36 we bought fit more like 2 than a 3. They also have a very sharp plastic smell coming out of the box. They seemed pretty soft.
2.0,It was a really cute outfit but was too small
2.0,I get Sheepskin Footbed every winter because I usually suffer of cold feet in winter.<br />I can put the finger on what exactly wrong with these but they just dont do the job and came flat just after one day use.
2.0,not for petite small people
2.0,cheesy looking
2.0,"I bought an XL and it fits wwwaayy to small. I even double checked that they sent me right size, which it looks like they did. The shorts are honestly the same size as my daughters XL shorts (kid size). There is no way these clothes are made for women.<br /><br />The only reason I have them 2 stars is because they came on time, are of good material, and look well stitched."
2.0,the material is thin and cheap. I read previous reviews to size up and I did from a small to medium. It is still very small.
2.0,"Compression is good but they don’t stay up, slide down th calf after a short walk."
2.0,It just lost its shape as the day progressed.
2.0,"Ordered a size 11/12, put them on and they were too small. Didn’t think anything of it until I tried to wear them again and saw that inside the shoe it said size 9/10. Now it’s to late for an exchange!"
2.0,Terrible stitching. Wanted to wear for Church but used as a night gown instead.
2.0,"I'm a big girl--solid 3x all around (22-24).  This jacket will work for the one night i have to wear it for a costume party, but nothing else.  Too small to close.  I'm not sure what the black polka dot thing is...if it is a skirt, someone was WAY off on the measuring there.  Cute little plastic accessories.  They won't last long but i only need them for one night.  You get what you pay for."
2.0,"The color is cute, but this outfit is Much smaller than the size chart indicates it would be. I doubt I’ll be able to wear this."
2.0,It looks cute but way too small. I got a large based of reviews and measurements. I usually wear large in sweatshirts for women but when I zipped it I couldn’t move my arms well. I returned it but I would definitely buy a size larger than whatever you want
2.0,Easily broken. The earpiece attachments to the lenses are fragile.
2.0,did not care for the fabric at all.
2.0,Looks great online but in live it is a cheap looking purse and does have a little smell to it that has nothing to do with real leather.
2.0,Sizing way off. I bought a 3mon and it fits like a 6-9 month
2.0,Beautiful but both broke quickly and the gold faded after 3 uses
2.0,"This product offers zero support.  I purchased them to sleep in, but it wasn't even enough for that.  If someone is looking for a bandeau alternative or just coverage, the material is soft and the colors are nice, but for regular wear, they just don't work."
2.0,Cheap quality watch. As soon I put the watch on it fell about in three places.
2.0,"The Top is nice. The Bottoms are awful...very strange cut, not full and flowy as stated....material is kind of stiff...disappointing."
2.0,"Looks nothing like the picture. The picture looks like a cotton tshirt material..the materiel of the dress looks like a night gown! It's very clingy, spandex type materiel. Very disappointed!!!"
2.0,Ordered two only received one disappointed with my order
2.0,Make sure that you look at the dimensions. This is the size of a small charm. I still love the look.
2.0,Clasp comes undone or won't click together.
2.0,item looked like it was for a child.  Maybe I missed something. I did not bother to return it.
2.0,"Cute, but one of the strands broke on the second day my granddaughter wore it."
2.0,"I bought these socks for my daughter's clueless costume. They were cute, but she said that they weren't the color she had expected. Other than that, good product."
2.0,I did not like the material it was made from. I ordered the same dress in a different color and it was great it didn't specify that the material was different from other dress only pattern that pattern was
2.0,I ordered these and a set of two black ones.  I loved the hot pink color.  However when they arrived the black ones were a nice quality with good thickness.  These however are very thin and a very poor quality.  I still love the color and will use them but I can't for workouts where I perspire heavily because they don't absorb a lot.
2.0,The cord is nice but the piece is flyweight and feels cheap. I am returning it.
2.0,"The dress is way too small. Usually a medium ordered a large and still was unable to fit. Not for curves. The faux leather is also a bit cheap, low quality"
2.0,Spected better quality and bigger bags
2.0,"You can see the stitching in the back from the tag and it's white, WHAT? It fits a little snug on the chest area. And if you're tall it comes above the knees. The color is vivid and true to advisement."
2.0,Stinky cheap China fabric. Took about 2 months to get. Went straight to the trash can.
2.0,"These were bike shorts, not triathlon shorts.  I don't know why they are advertised as triathlon shorts.  I bought a pair of padded bike shorts on amazon and these were exactly the same.  I bought a pair of triathlon shorts directly from Aerotech, and they were different than these shorts.  I just didn't realize the mistake that was made processing this order until the shorts had been worn and it was too late to send them back."
2.0,"Even though ordered a small and followed their sizing guide, this dress is way too big and just looks wrinkled. I won't be wearing this ever. Waste of money."
2.0,They do not fit as shown in the picture and it tore up fast.
2.0,"After a few times wearing these socks, they now don't stay on my heel."
2.0,My immediate thoughts of this product was that it was cute. Not Pandora quality but okay for the price.  Well after having it for a couple of months I noticed that the stones are almost all gone.  I will have to remove it from my bracelet because I no longer have any colored stones/crystals.
2.0,"UA has been slipping with the quality of all their products, These are no different - the 'no show' is lower in the back than other brands and falls under your heels after 5-10 of wearing. Would return them if I could."
2.0,"In too big a hurry for even Amazon Prime, I bought a pair of these at a local drug store.  I like them so much I was going to buy two more on Amazon; but the photo on the web page is not the same as what comes directly from Dioptics (at a much higher price) or the local drug store (at a somewhat higher price).  The &#34;authentic pair&#34; I own has a metal rime around both lenses, which reinforces/stiffens them and to which the adjustment sprigs & holding clips are attached.  The photo on the web page looks like there is no perimeter band and instead the clips and springs are glued to the lenses.  Not the same thing at all, and would be much less durable.<br />If the photo is just old and out of date, my apologies; but they aren't doing themselves any favors with it."
2.0,"I usually wear large sizes but this was way too large, The sleeve length was way out of proportion"
2.0,These things are so small..only for people with small ears.
2.0,"It came in a different color than pic, I still wore it.  It looks cheap, trying to find a better alternative than this."
2.0,Just wore out way to quickly. I know it was inexpensive but I expected some life. You get what you pay for.
2.0,Would not send promised parts
2.0,The rings are ok but doesn’t hold the material and will slide out. It would be better if it had some teeth to catch the material and keep it in place.
2.0,The shirt is beautiful but I had to exchange it for a different size. That’s when the trouble began. Weeks later the company claims they did not receive my return and are threatening to take my refund back!  Now I’m having trouble contacting them.  I hope they read this.  I was very happy til now.
2.0,"This is a really awkward dress. I thought that b/c it said that it tied that it was a wrap dress, but it's not- it has a single stitch cinching the two pieces of fabric together above the bust (almost to the neck) and it has an elastic band under the bust that was definitely not made with large chested ladies in mind- getting it over my chest was a very careful, awkward process. But, it was big everywhere else- like yards of fabric billowing around me. I am somewhat short (5'3&#34;), but it was a good 8-10&#34; too long (without heels). It does come with a separate tie, but because the elastic is so high (empire waist), it would have looked strange. It's going back."
2.0,This item was cute but waaaaaay too small! I forgot to send it back so I gave it to my sister.
2.0,"The earrings are well-made and I like the style.  However, the stones themselves seemed very flat and dull.  I returned them."
2.0,Runs small hard material
2.0,You get what you paid for!
2.0,This romper looks nothing like the picture and the material is very odd. I ordered a small and I'm 5'0 and 120 Ibs and it was loose on me. If I could go back I wouldn't order it.
2.0,Bigger than what I expected and the fangs are pointy. It changes colors as well.
2.0,I was dissappointed in these slippers.  Cheap foreign made and didn't fit....
2.0,"Very cute, doesn't last...<br /><br />When I first got this bag it came with purple stains on the straps, I didn't mind to much since the bag itself was very pretty and since I didnt want to deal with the hassle of returning it I kept it but I've had this bag for less than 3 months and have used it briefly 3 times. On the third use the latch completely tore off when attempting to close the bag (the bag only had my phone and charger in it when it broke). It's disappointing and I'm glad I didn't buy the bag in its other colors as I had originally wanted to, it's cute but unfortunately I won't buy again."
2.0,"Love the shirt, but it is very faded and you can not read the words. Not what the picture looks like.  Very disappointed."
2.0,"The lens on these is way too strong. A 1.5 feels like a 2.5, so I have to return. I would order at least .50-1.00 less than you normally would."
2.0,Fell apart two weeks after purchase
2.0,Breaks very easily! Very cute while it lasted. Returned the 1st one. On my 2nd one.
2.0,"Nice size, but zipper pouch keep on coming lose and causing the glass to drop."
2.0,I had to give this outfit to my Mother. Looks good on the model but not in person unless you have a small figure.
2.0,The breast area was too big had to send back
2.0,"this is a gift for my grandson. the workmanship was very poor. some edge stitching was not ever done leaving raw edges of fabric exposed. fortunately, i have a sewing machine and will repair it myself as his birthday is a few days away.  would not order this item again."
2.0,"The seller uses 2 sets of pictures for the headbands. The pictures of them on the babies is NOT what they look like. They are flat as a pancake. If you try to shape them, the feathers shift and look wonky. Sometimes they break. And then the flowers fall off."
2.0,they tore apart after three or four times wearing them.. i'm sad
2.0,Material low quality<br />Fit is tight and not flattering
2.0,Unfinished edges and mot in description. Cheaply made but pretty camou print
2.0,"The mask is actually blue, and it looks comical. But, It suited what I needed for Halloween, so I am keeping it."
2.0,The green is more like pea green. I wanted more forest green.
2.0,"I liked it, But which I received twice are different"
2.0,Wet thin like a tshirt rather than a sweat shirt. Very small. I bought a 7/8 for my son who just started to wear 6 and it is too small for him. I thought one size up would be good since I saw reviews that it ran small. I guess you need to go up two sizes instead one one.
2.0,"These glasses are an odd size. Not kids size, but not adult sized either. They look pretty good, and they are cheap. So I wasn't out too much money on glasses I can't use."
2.0,It really looks cheap.
2.0,"This bra is pretty to look at but is not a conventional ""bra"" it goes over the head and has no front or back clasp to get on or off. This makes for a not so fun experience, I was not expecting a sport's bra aesthetic. I am usually a fan of longline bras and I do like the bra once it is on. It is just not at all what I expected."
2.0,runs very small even though I ordered a size bigger it's still too small to button and very tight on the arms.
2.0,didn't look right and the feather was different from the feather on blouse. then I got sick and let the deadline pass to send back
2.0,"First one arrived missing parts of the band, replacement leaked just from wearing in the shower 2 or 3 times with water in the face."
2.0,Way way way too small. I am an extra large. in size 12/14 us sizing and ordered based onthat..  .. this looks like a bean poles young teen sized dress. I was very sad. I really  liked it when I saw it online. But its tiny. When I get a chance I will take a picture of it. Looks like my best friends girl will get a new dress..lol
2.0,The shirt was already torn when I received it on the “v” part of shirt. Sent back! Cute otherwise!
2.0,"It appears to be a nice lightweight robe for use during but the size is way off.  Either the seller is fibbing or it's made for small stature people.  I buy 1x to 2x all the time.  This 2x is what I would call medium, not even large.  Based on their measurements I need an 6x or 7x.  Don't waste your time with this product.  I will keep it for the teens that visit."
2.0,"Strange and uncomfortable seams, too short (I'm 5'6) and not opaque (because of the fit).<br /><br />I'm giving two stars because at least they didn't rip."
2.0,"This shirt is Very cute! The color is very cheerful.  But the sizing is too small, much like most Allegra K shirts."
2.0,Not what I expected.  The pattern didn't line up.  I'm returning.<br />Material is ok though.
2.0,This is really cute design and the fabric has a shine to it and is slightly see through. My problem with the shirt is where the stripes are at (the arms and chest) there is a big stitch that sticks out and is quite scratchy underneath. I love the look but even when I wear a tank or a tee underneath my arms itch because of that stitch. I hate to give it a low rating because the look is cute as pictured but the comfort is not there. A bit disappointed!
2.0,This dress is so unflattering.  The tiers hit at weird places.  It’s also very heavy.
2.0,I disliked threat the decal already came off the garment.
2.0,Didn’t care for these
2.0,I used the size description chart and it was wrong. If you purchase go by your shirt size.
2.0,"The leggings are too baggy and loose, unlike similar yoga/athletic wear I own."
2.0,"Not what I expected..didn't fit right, didn't look right"
2.0,"Quite satisfied with appearance and quality. Good value. Haven't figured out how to program it, yet. Instructions are sketchy. Two weeks later: the second hand stopped working."
2.0,Neck too large ....poor quality ...you get what u pay for
2.0,Was expecting it to be sturdy..
2.0,"The shirt is very lightweight and looks like it would be comfortable if it fit, but it's not even close. My husband wears an XL usually. I ordered a 2X to be safe. He could not even bring the front together enough to touch, let alone button. I thought maybe they sent the wrong size, but oddly enough, there's no tag in this shirt so there's no way to know.<br /><br />Sometimes in unisex t-shirts (which are usually men's sizes) I'll wear a large. I tried this on, and it didn't even fit me! I could button the top, but towards the hips would be really tight. I suppose I can wear it over a tank top or something, but it certainly won't be hanging on my husband's side of the closet."
2.0,Hated the huge tie in the back. Runs a bit large
2.0,The face of the watch is larger then I expected.  The watch appears cheap. Not in love with the watch at all
2.0,cheap sent it back
2.0,De largo es muy corto y eso que escogí una talla mas grande no queda bien feo!!
2.0,"I bought this expecting better quality from the pictures, but it is definitely very low quality, especially for the chain. I gave it two stars because switching the pendants to a better chain might work, as the pendants are cheap feeling, but from a distance would look okay."
2.0,"Way too small, had to return it. It came with an extender for the band clip, which was necessary because the 32 band was way too small, but the extender was SO itchy all day long. Disappointed."
2.0,Significantly smaller than it looks in picture.
2.0,I didn’t really like the fit of this blouse because it was too tight fitting across the chest area
2.0,even though it said oversized I wasn't prepared for how much -- it was a little larger than expected
2.0,Great at first then got a hole in crotch after wearing three times.
2.0,"Bought this for my wife. Its real small,like for a kid. Not sure it will work."
2.0,"The other reviews talking about the bizarre shape of the bust are spot on. I have a small chest and, as a result, I'm pretty, er... Perky. But the dress is sewn in such a way that you're expected to have your breasts growing out from just under your neck. I can't really explain it. I'm hoping I can have a friend tailor it for me, but I'm not sure it's salvageable.<br /><br />Otherwise it's a gorgeous dress. I feel bad leaving a less than stellar review, but seeing as how I paid for a dress I can't even wear, I gotta give it 2/5"
2.0,It doesn’t fit my face.
2.0,"I’m a size 10, usually M-L in tops, and I ordered the nude in an XL and it was WAYYYY too small. Definitely order a size up!"
2.0,TOO SHEER ONCE YOU PUT IT ON
2.0,I order two pairs of the largest sock that this company sales X-Large. It took me 15 minutes to get the socks on.I wre them one day and they hurt my feet because of  size. I suggest the company offer a XX-Large sock and increase the X-Large size to that of its competitors.<br />I would like to return the Two socks or swap for a similar XX-Large sock that is a compression sock.
2.0,It was rather small width wise and a bit shorter than I had expected. I am 6' 1&#34; and it seemed like it was sized for a middle schooler.
2.0,"They are comfortable if you plan to stay indoors, and relax on the couch. They get very hot when in the sun and they don’t stay up. I found my self pulling them up consistently and I order I usual size in pants."
2.0,Good slippers good deal but definitely not like a cloud more like hard plastic but cheap
2.0,Fabric is not a cotton blend...it is straight polyester. Style is cute but quality of construction is not very good. The sleeves were weird and sort of turn up. This could have been a cute romper if it was made with better fabric and sewn correctly.
2.0,If the necklace is not sterling silver so why the little tag say 925 on it. I hope the heart shape pendant  is sterling silver bcuz I bought it for my nieces.
2.0,I only got one of the scarfs. The zebra print never came! It was supposed to be a Christmas present for my daughter!  niceEshop didn't take half the money out of my account...they took the full payment but only provided half the order. Lucky for them this didn't cost much.
2.0,"My wife thought this was too small, and less attractive than she expected."
2.0,Terrible quality.. very cheap material and see thru. You would have to wear a slip under it. I would not recommend buying these dresses.
2.0,I am disappointed at myself for paying for a product that broke off in one day!! I need a refund..when I put on the earnings on the back butterfly and the thin rod came apart from the earring..what a disappointment ...SUPER LIGhTWEiGhT 😒
2.0,"Looks good and feels better, but don’t judge this book by it’s cover. Solid concept but the execution is horrible. The product should have a fragile label on it. You should not purchase this product if you have a bad back. No one should be spending their time picking up cards from the floor. Good luck"
2.0,They are a nice cut but material varies from color to color.  Navy felt great but black was like sandpaper.  I'm 5'7&#34; 210lb Bodubuilder and I could barely get them one (XL).  If wear a Medium or Large T-shirt the XL would be good.  I would try a XXL but they aren't available from this vendor.
2.0,"These are super cute but material is cheap and super see-thru! They're more see-thru then some of the light colored leggings I've tried on.<br /><br />--<br /><br />Ordered another pair thinking maybe i got a knockoff pair or something but nope! Same! Material is thin and a little rough, again, totally see thru even with Nude underwear on!<br /><br />they’re so cute! What a shame!"
2.0,Be aware of the gold pieces on each side. Mine was coming apart from purse. Doesn't seem very well made as far as this goes. Would be perfect without the gold wiring to worry about. I am sure in just a matter of time it will come loose from the purse on both sides.
2.0,"does not look like what I thought it would be, looks like a towel around your head, gave them to goodwill store."
2.0,"The ring around the outside broke the 1st time I wore it. It also left a green ring around my finger. For the money it’s okay, but I would have expected it to last longer than 1 wear"
2.0,They feel like puffy moon boots when you walk and the insole flops around when i walk. If i didnt need them to dig myself out of the snow storm.. I would have sent them back.
2.0,"I buy a lot of clothes off Amazon and some are hits and amazing finds and some are misses. This was a miss for me, the dress came exactly as pictured. Though the dress gives you absolute no shape and was not flattering on. I’m 5’3, 120lbs, 34D and I ordered a small and it fit more like and XS-Small."
2.0,It’s cute in style. But it is very big. Be mindful that the small is still very large and may require you to tailor it or tied in a knot in the front. Won't buy this again
2.0,Material is too thick and causes leg to become too warm.
2.0,Not the same quality as it appeared. Late delivery
2.0,"Did not hold up  at all. Truly a waste of money, rusted very quickly."
2.0,"First, let me say that these socks are exceptionally comfortable and do precisely what they are supposed to do in terms of compression and support.  I love wearing them.  That said, I am afraid that I cannot give them an unreserved recommendation to buy because the lifespan of these socks is just too short.  The areas of the balls of the feet and the heels wear through incredibly fast.  I made an initial purchase of 2 pairs on Amazon, and when I experienced the problem, I contacted the Seller.  They indicated that there may have been an issue with that batch, and issued a discount to purchase again.  I bought 4 more pairs, for a total of 6 pairs.  The second batch did exactly the same thing in the same short time.  Very disappointing.  For me, it's just not economic good sense to keep purchasing these socks."
2.0,"Its warm! but it fits horribly (big and baggy) and looks more like a pj instead of something you would use to go out.<br />I was hoping I could use it at work, but now I just use it for bed during winter because its cozy."
2.0,Nice material.Nice shirt but I sent it back. The snaps were cold against my skin. The snap section needs to be lined.
2.0,"I had high hopes. But the dress was VERY tight and narrow in the arms. I’m normally a medium so I bought a size up as well and it was also VERY Tight in the arms. Weirdly loose in the stomach, and tight in the thighs. Both dresses were like this. Potentially okay if you’re a very slim person."
2.0,"These are not shaped like real aviators, strong and durable for the money though."
2.0,Very cute style but in an odd scratchy unappealing material
2.0,The small diamond fell off.
2.0,Shoe Is already torn up. Wore first on June 5th and it's now Aug 3rd.  Shoe has been torn up for 3 weeks now
2.0,The anchor is larger than I wanted. And the length of rope is quite long. I had to wrap it around my wrist 5 or 6x.
2.0,Did not fit the earrings - holes too small.
2.0,"Flimsy.  Thinner than your average T-shirt,"
2.0,The frame looks like cheap plastic sprayed with chrome paint.
2.0,I dont like the material or the way it fits. It's like a moomoo.
2.0,"I really like the bracelet, but it comes aliose very easliy"
2.0,If you are a pre pubescent child this may fit. I am 105lbs 5' 1&#34; and cant gey it over my hips or tatas (ordered a small) ... however if i could get it to fit i think it wouldve looked very cute. I only give it 2 stars bc it didnt fit. The sellers were on top of shipping quickly and recieved it in a very timely manner.
2.0,"This is cute, but the material doesn't give and it is way shorter then I expected. Runs quite small."
2.0,"It worked great for about two months, then it wouldn't shut off causing the batteries to boil all the water out of each battery/cell.  I discovered it just in time to save my golf cart batteries."
2.0,"This watch is HUGE! I'm a big guy, and it still looks huge on me. And sorry but it's just ugly too. It looks a lot more attractive in the photo than in real life."
2.0,This dress is completely see through.
2.0,Was between empire and regular waist.
2.0,Way too tight in the waist. Unfortunate because it would look nice if not for that but it’s a fit that makes no sense for a hockey jersey
2.0,Not long enough for me...I am 5'5 it stopped at my calf. The photo shows it it long on the model....unless she is 5'0. Very flimsy too. # returned
2.0,Using it less than a month and the bag is already peeling apart on the edges.
2.0,will not fit a 5.11 tactical web belt
2.0,Very flat without any padding
2.0,They fit well but the color of them looks faded. I thought they were all black
2.0,Very big I sized down and there still too big and too long
2.0,"This is tiny, insignificant, and looks like a trinket from the doctor's office. Being that it is only 1 cent currently is the only thing that makes this slightly worth it."
2.0,My daughter asked what I wanted for my birthday.  I searched the Amazon site for Swiss Army Watch because I like the brand and this came up at the head of the listings.  Being cheap and something my daughter could afford I sent her the link.  When I received it I found it is not a Swiss Army watch.  The box does not include instructions.  The timer bezal is glued in place and does not turn at all so it and the compass bezal are strictly ornamental.  I went to the web site on the box and found that it is not water resistant so the depth meter is just there for show.  This is a good watch for a child that tells time only and has a cool military look.  If you want the actual functions like the bezal and depth meter you will need to spend more money to get them.  I guess you really get what you pay for.
2.0,"This top is about two sizes too small even after ordering up a size from my daughter's regular size. Material isn't the softest, but might soften up after a wash with softener."
2.0,Runs small and thin not hsppy
2.0,"This shirt is nothing like it appears in the picture, other than color and pocket. I should have listened to other reviews. It was fitted and thick. It looks like it would be loose and thin, which is what I was looking for. But sadly it is not like that. I returned it."
2.0,Fits like a cup smaller ordered a D and her boobs are coming out all over the place. The clasp in the middle is to far apart and the shoulder straps keep falling. The stitching is already coming loose. Not made very well
2.0,"Does not fit my large glasses well, too small for complete coverage"
2.0,These shoes actually smell.  Whatever rubber they've used has  strong odor.  One bow on one shoe is completely messed up.  They're cute but they are not as comfortable as you would assume a flip flop would be.
2.0,"The picture looks like it’s cotton but it is anything but cotton. Material is like a football Jersey, it’s see through as well. The font and picture turned out great but like I said not what it looks like in picture. Purchased for my son"
2.0,"I ordered size LARGE. They are not true to size, more like a SMALL."
2.0,"I'm a size 6/8 and I ordered this in a small anticipating a fit like the model.(snug at bust, then poose). Sadly, when I tried it on it was way too big (and I'm currently 6 months pregnant). My husband asked me why I ordered a mumu. I'm returning it, which makes me sad."
2.0,So that was disappointing.
2.0,When wearing the chain broke within a hour of wear and it was loose around my belly. I was able to fix it but who wants to have an outfit malfunction while being cute and  out in public??
2.0,"I ordered two pair of these  in M same company  one pair looks like they are for a very short person and the others well they are ok I guess, but I will not order any more. if had not washed them I would be sending them back, but its my loss not worth the money, and on top of that no stretch"
2.0,Honestly I read the reviews and thought I was getting an awesome suitcase. While traveling and using the largest one it kept wanting to tip over. The wheels did NOT cooperate at all. Very frustrating and I wish I had bought a different one.
2.0,I like the texture and color or the shirt. But the size is wayyy off. I ordered a small and I received what looks more like a large! It’s huge and I’ll need to try to shrink it before I can even wear it. Hopefully the design won’t easily come off in the wash because I’ll have to wash it before I can even wear it
2.0,"Really cute, however the hat was horribly warped and bent. Strings hanging loose on it, and the part that actually goes over your head is really shallow and doesn’t fit well. Would probably be better described as a child’s hat"
2.0,"Cute case of body jewelry. Unless you like your body jewelry I’ll-fitting & of poor quality, this lot is a lightweight mish mash of cheap-o body jewelry. Breaks easily, does not stay in place well with captive beads often popping off—pretty & shiny, not for long-lasting use."
2.0,Compass wyit working after a week of wear.  So I wouldn't count on that.  Otherwise the rest is fine
2.0,"the wire cable is starting to come apart at the top. this is causing the sharp wire to poke your fingers/hands when you carry them. it is a good idea but after use, it just doesn't hold up to normal wear."
2.0,"You get what you pay for!!!!  Received a short time ago and this morning one side of band just fell off the watch.  I suppose it cac be re-attached.  However, not by these 85year old fingers.  The watch itself is very nice and is accurate."
2.0,"This dress was very large when I tried it on before washing it. Once I had put it in the drier on a higher heat setting, it shrunk and became a bit more flattering. I’m sure I’ll still wear it but it didn’t meet my expectations."
2.0,Was a little different than I expected but was ok
2.0,This dress is completely sheet  you can see right through it .
2.0,This was an awesome design...however it broke just a week after my son started using it.
2.0,This is not really a sweatshirt more just like a regular shirt that hangs. No shape to it at all no off the shoulder like the picture shows. The colors are not bright and vibrant like the picture shows.  More like a bunch of dull muted colors. Very light and washed out. Don't know if I just got a bad one or not but I will be returning it
2.0,Gave it to my infant grandson it was so small
2.0,"I ordered this for my best friend because it was her birthday, but when I got it and gave it to her, it wasn't even a necklace, it was more like a necklace, the chain itself was very long."
2.0,The sunglasses are super cute but the shipment was missing 2 pairs including the white ones. I went to pack the bachelorette goodie bags and realized 3 days before the party that I’m missing some. It’s no fun if the bride can’t participate.
2.0,These came in quickly but we're very uncomfortable and are too short for a monroe piercing.
2.0,"A real struggle to put on, as there is not a lot of stretch (a surprise)."
2.0,"It’s a nice quality and pretty thick; however the the photo gives off the impression, the sweater was longer in length.  I wanted it more ankle/ground length.  This sweater hits more to knee length.  I’m only 5’ 4” in height and ordered a medium.  Any larger in size and it would’ve been entirely too loose."
2.0,"Honestly, I feel like this looks like something that would be made in a high school home economics course. Also, the color I selected was burgundy, but it's more crimson. The scalloped hemline around the bottom is an odd shape. It definitely looks better in the pictures than in real life."
2.0,The gray stripes on the bag were crooked
2.0,I am 213lbs and curvy.  I ordered the XXL.  It’s too small to be comfortable for me.  I’m keeping it because I’ve been losing weight and I think it will fit when I’m around 200lbs.  The shirt is good quality and I love the design.
2.0,"I love all things HP so I was excited to receive these socks. Unfortunately, they were too tight around the calf area. I was losing circulation. So I guess I have to give them to my kids."
2.0,The material is not very soft and shrinks when washed. I bought 4 sets in different sized and the sleeves on all of them were really short. The pattern is cute and they do offer a wide size range but these pajama sets are not worth the price.
2.0,HUGE in the arms like way way way way too big
2.0,Material looked good but the jacket is waaay too small.  Would recommend buying up a size or two if that is an option for you.
2.0,I would suggest that put it on for a couple of tries so that it stretches and forms to your body
2.0,"I really liked the way the fit when I initially tried them on, but there is not enough elastic in the waist to keep them up. Any movement and they are riding down.  I just don't want to have to pull my pants up all day."
2.0,"It felt too much like a costume, mostly because of how big and clunky the corset lacing on the back is."
2.0,Ordered one size larger then what I wear and fits good. Quality is poor. The picture of the shirt is NOT what I ordered. I ordered a christmas evergreen fresh cut sweatshirt and got a hallmark and coffee sweatshirt! Not impressed with the wrong item! Ordered xl and wear large.
2.0,The finding of both earrings were bent. I tried to make them straight and one of them ended up breaking. I don’t recommend!
2.0,"The top part of this dress is really long on me, making it look kind of awkward and matronly. The fabric is nice, kind of stretchy but not see through."
2.0,Size too big not what I expecred
2.0,Only works a little
2.0,Too weird and too tight. Doesn’t took good.!!
2.0,"I liked the key chain. Key word ""liked"". The only thing left of this item is the ring...the connection between the ring and bottom part is unacceptable. Especially for a Jeep key chain.<br /><br />I would have liked this better if I were one of those people who doesn't actually ""use"" them. It is nice for show, but durability is an absolute ZERO.<br /><br />If you really are hard set on purchasing this item, find a welder and have them attach it for you. Otherwise, you will end up like me and just have a ring - something you can find in any hardware store."
2.0,"Nice comfortable shirt, if you’re hight is under 5’9.  Any taller and it’s gonna run waaay too short."
2.0,"Fit my daughter perfectly, but was not what I expected. The seams were coming apart and the material was so thin I could see through it and it wasn’t even wet."
2.0,"Busted after a few months, not great"
2.0,The materials seem good but it is hard to turn the knob without some kind of protection. The knob should be clad with rubber.
2.0,"Disappointed. I took a chance hoping that the dress would fit but,  like some other reviewers,  it came down below my knees. I thought about taking it to the tailor to have it taken up but it didn’t seem worth it<br />I also didn’t realize that return shipping was not included so it cost another$7.15 to ship back.<br />I would tell you don’t waist your time or money."
2.0,"I was disappointed with the length. I ended up returning them. I'm 5'5"" and without heels the pants just barely hit the ground. I was looking for more of a look like the pictures shown. I ordered a medium and the waist fit perfect. Other than the length they looked and kit amazing. Was super bummed that they weren't long enough."
2.0,Ran very small - had to return it
2.0,"This dress is super cute and comfy, but it’s very cheaply made. I wore it for only a few hours and there’s a big hole in the side, right below the arm crease area. The dress isn’t too tight either, it just wasn’t sewn properly."
2.0,"It is pretty, but arrived with something nasty in it. Hopefully that's glue and not mucus! Eww"
2.0,"These are too small, not strechy, very thin, no grip towerds the toes. Discarded."
2.0,Very long. It is cheap tho. I had to cut a few strings off the dress when i opened it. I love the length but i don’t particularly like the material.
2.0,"Like the stone color. However, the ring is large and looks inexpensive."
2.0,No llegan como uno las ordena
2.0,Looked cute in picture.  Vinyl printing is very rubbery and thick in texture. The design won’t hold up long when being washed after a few times. The vinyl will crack and peel. Quality just not in the printing. Returning for sure.
2.0,The photo is really pretty.  The bracelet in person looks half as pretty and is extremely heavy on the wrist.  Hangs in a clunky manner and for the size it claims to be it really runs large.
2.0,Super duper cheap. I knew at this price quality wouldn’t be the best but one pair already has cracked and the other is very hard to open the glasses. Polarization is good. Lens clarity is poor
2.0,Pieces fall off of them. They're very pretty but doesn't take long for them to lose pieces
2.0,This was advertised as an EMBROIDERED face mask. It definitely is not embroidered anywhere. The flowers are just printed on the mask.
2.0,"Runs small....or my head runs large. Lol. Either way, had to return it."
2.0,Wife says it itches to much. The size is to small for It's actually size that it says it is.
2.0,"Well, I was hoping this would help me. I have problems driving at night. The glare and the starbursts are really bad for me. I didn't notice much difference. Also, one of the lenses popped out.  However, I have been told this has helped some people."
2.0,If your an xl in hats. Or didn’t get a haircut for an extended period. This thing is maxed out on stretch capabilities due to the wire from speaker to speaker. They give no wiggle room.
2.0,"I thought it was good quality, but then I wore this outfit twice and the elastic on the neck line tore.  I haven't even washed it yet.  It's unwearable now"
2.0,The dress does not fit properly around the neck and the back area.
2.0,"I love the fabric and the print, shirt would fit fine if the sides didn't cut way up.  Side seams do not look like what is pictured and it's very frustrating to have a shirt you both love and hate, every time I lift my arms at all my skin shows.  Horrible, please fix this terrible pattern/design flaw!"
2.0,Did not look good on me even though it is a nice suit.
2.0,Works just fine for the intentions in which it was made. Good price. Good quality. However the area where the ends snap are very difficult to get through toddler pants/jeans built loops.
2.0,"Bought this as a gift. The only thing bad I have to say is that the tool they sent to take out the links is really a piece of junk. It bent on the first one, then I had to use it gingerly until it finally broke on the third link I was trying to take out. My girlfriend ended up going to a jeweler to get the final link removed."
2.0,Watch is not a universal size and cannot be expanded - it comes with no extra links and seller has not responded to a request for extra. A shame as it looks nice but can't be worn.
2.0,After washing twice in a weeks time the stitching came apart and they went in to the trash sorry I even bought these for work at all
2.0,Didn't get ring pictured but did get several anxiety rings! The only down fall was they are size 5 and i wear a 10 so definitely not fitting. But for 5 bucks my kids now have some really cute rings!
2.0,I bought it as a gift my mother. She wore it out one time and loved it by the time she got home the chain connecting the bracelet to the ring broke along with a couple of the gear decorations. I guess they need to use stronger super glue to hold it together because it’s not made to last at all therefore not worth the buy. A waste of money
2.0,Item is more light Gray than Image.
2.0,Dress pictured on the right is NOT green. I was expecting an olive green and this is more like beige with a green tint. Disappointed- this was for family pictures and it doesn’t go with the color scheme. Otherwise the fit is great
2.0,"I find Homeyee dresses to be hit or miss. I have some that I love and others that go to the trash. This one didn't work for me. I'm 5'5"" and this dress was somehow too baggy in the wrong areas and too tight in the wrong areas. It was tight right over my stomach and baggy around my arms and chest. The cowl (extra fabric around the neck) was way too big. It looks comically large on me and is overwhelming as an accent on the dress. I think if you're tall or have longer upper body then this shape would probably work better for you. The fabric feels fine and is a bit thick. Seems like it would work well for a winter dress."
2.0,"I was provided with this choker necklace by the manufacturer at no cost for evaluation during it's launch period. I measured this choker at 11&quot; total length from clasp to the end of the pendant, with exactly 8&quot; of length to go around the neck.  Here are my thoughts after examining it and trying it on:<br /><br />The positives:<br />- it's a pretty piece of costume jewelry<br />- the blue crystals sparkle nicely<br />- the tiny clear diamond-like crystals add plenty of sparkle<br />- once you have the sections unkinked it drapes well when worn<br />- weighing a mere 2.16 ounces, it sits lightly around the neck<br /><br />The negatives:<br />- made from electroplated alloy according to the manufacturer, the material feels more like plastic though.<br />- the sections of chain kink easily<br />- the crystals look like plastic<br />- the product description mentions an extender chain, but there was none<br /><br />Overall, this is a pretty choker that looks like the costume jewelry that it is. If you're in the market for an inexpensive choker with some bling, then this might suit you well. If you're looking for a piece that looks like good quality though, then you might want to pass on this one."
2.0,"I was looking for a basic watch for work. What i received was a “Cheezy”, Over-Priced, POJ that looks like it can be found at a truck stop! I guess for $30, you should expect much, but even the “Gold” color is actually more like a cheap red-ish copper. In short, this watch looks better online, which is where it should have stayed!!!<br /><br />#Keep_it_Moving; 1%"
2.0,Tiny! These are too small for my four year old. Pretty disappointing. They don’t even touch her ears. Will be returning.
2.0,unfortunately I'm 77 and it's extremely hard to get them off.
2.0,Very cheaply made.  When you squeeze to open them does not work as it should.
2.0,"I’ve had these for a few months now and they’re lovely ( just like the picture) I get so many compliments when wearing. My problem with these is if I wear them for too long my ears start to get raw, itchy and swollen, I have to switch back to silicone every 2 weeks to let my ears heal. Also one of the plugs is slightly smaller and sometimes falls out when sleeping. I don’t know if I’ll buy from this company again this is just my two cents."
2.0,"There is one dog design mask with adjustable ear elastics & a filter pocket in this package along with a matching bandana. The silicone adjusters on the ear elastics will fall off if adjusted out too far. There is also a nose wire that allows me to mold this to my face. However, after all the adjustments, I find these are still a bit roomy around my upper cheeks  and my chin area. Although the bandana is nice, it is nothing I will use.  The current price of $9.95 is on the high side of the competitively priced for this duo. If the mask was not so loose, it would have received 5 stars from me simply because I really love the design."
2.0,"Not very good quality...shipped fast, easy to put on, but the &#34;silver&#34; accents are cheap looking."
2.0,"I really wanted this romper to work. It’s so cute.  However, I had no idea it’s see through. It would work better as a swimsuit cover up, you can see everyyyyything underneath it. Also, I’m 5’10” and this did not fit my torso or butt at all. So tall girls be forewarned!"
2.0,It is two pieces of knitted material sewn together so there are two seams.  The infinity scarves I have seen have no seam that is why they are called infinity.  The shipping was exorbitant and by the time I returned them it was not financially worthwhile.
2.0,"The image in the product photo is way sharper than the real thing. It is hard to tell what it is. It is a photo of a lens covered by glass, not a real lens, for those of you who were hoping."
2.0,Very cute but first wash and it shrunk and got a hole
2.0,"This arrived broken, so i have to return which is just a giant pain."
2.0,Appliqués all came off when aprons were washed.
2.0,"I ordered a blue one in mid December and realized that it would ship from China and arrive between Jan. and Feb. 1.  The tracking information has been useless.  The wallet arrived today. It appears to be well made and more or less as it appears in the pictures.  But it does not smell like leather. The odor is strong, a cross between chemical or barnyard odors.  It's been here less than 30 minutes and already I can't stomach the smell.  It's got to be returned!<br />[[ASIN:B01MSNCI5E Itslife Women's Large Capacity Luxury Wax Genuine Leather Clutch Wallet Card Holder Ladies Purse (Blue RFID Blocking)]]"
2.0,"It's cute but uncomfortable to wear and constantly pokes you.  Also don't think it's hypoallergenic cause it caused irritation, waste of money"
2.0,"Cool shirt, but after one wash, a second wear,  a hole appeared at the arm hole. Not stitched very well I guess."
2.0,Probably great for kids but too small for my adult head.
2.0,"Not what I expected at all. I returned it. They would work well for lounge pants and sleep wear I guess, but they were WAY TOO BIG in the crotch area, way to baggie.  Also, I wanted sweat pants, and these are not sweat pants. If you like having your crotch flap around between your knees, then these are the pants for you -- and there is no need to wear them below your butt because they are that big. If you like wearing your pants around your thighs below your butt, then you will not enjoy wearing these.  Also, when you sit or bend over, your underwear line is visible through the material. If you wear boxers and like to pull your pants up around your thighs below your butt, then you probably don't care if your underwear is visible or not, but the legs are way too long for that, and there is no way to keep them up... I guess you could roll them if you wanted to -- depends on how much of a thug you want to look like... good luck running from the cops wearing these around your thighs below your butt."
2.0,"The lights came on about 3 times for a total of less than 45 minutes when we first got the umbrella months ago and never worked again.  I reached out to the company and got no response.  Poor quality, poor customer service."
2.0,"se ponen negros sin usar, que pena"
2.0,"Poor quality, pills after first or second wash. Too bad because I liked the monsters but they look bad because of low quality. Circo makes similarly priced boys socks that are much better quality."
2.0,I had to give this product to my granddaughter. It was the wrong size. I order a. Size 3x and got an small size.
2.0,"Much shorter than advertised, other than that nice belt.  Sending it back and ordering a longer one"
2.0,"Cheaply made, lettering peeled off easily. Only used for a week before tossing. Take your money else where"
2.0,Too small—large is not large<br />Stitches unraveling
2.0,"I originally bought small, too small, bought a medium too small too. Returns take forever."
2.0,"Hat looks nice but is too small.  Although it has an adjustment in the back, the overall size is too small for that to make a difference.  I have not had this problem with other hats.  Too bad because I liked the way it looks."
2.0,"this out fit was nice, the only thing is that it was cut was short at the legs and too heavy at the chest area but other then that it was cute."
2.0,"Don't know how to better describe it but the edges don't come down far enough.<br />Nice looking, seems to be decent quality but it isn't right for me.<br />I need to send it back"
2.0,Tight through the breast and arms with comfortable (loose) waist area.
2.0,Thin and very cheaply made.
2.0,"It's almost like a maternity tank, way too flowy, no shape at all even the back side there's just too much room. It's like a t-shirt material that shows my bra in a bad way, idk. Color is same deep red as the picture, which I do love, but I'll be returning this. Im a bigger girl, I can't wear a bag and expect to look good!!"
2.0,Inferior quality. Very disappointing.
2.0,I cannot image how big these socks would be for smaller feet. I’m size 8.5 US and these are way too big.
2.0,"I think the style of this romper is very flattering, but the fabric is really thin and in a cream color it is really see-through. I think I will keep it for beach days, but I was a bit disappointed for the price."
2.0,It didn’t fit the way I thought it would. Not too fond of it and hadn’t worn it out. I’m actually thinking about giving it away. The size I bought was fine everywhere except the arms.
2.0,"Very small, wife has small wrist and it is too tight."
2.0,"Out of all five, only three stayed working. Two only lasted a few minutes before they stopped ticking ."
2.0,a little flimsy and not a nice material.
2.0,"I thought I had hit the jackpot when I saw this dress on sale for $15 AND it was going to arrive the very next day, just in time for a wedding I was invited to at the last second.<br /><br />Thankfully I took a backup dress when I left the house that day. Because the dress was entirely see through. 100% see through"
2.0,Nice and sticky but the glue does not go all the way to the edge so the edges dont lay flat against the skin. Depending on the shirt it shows bumpy underneath
2.0,Was too big didn't like the material
2.0,"The bracelet itself was georgous and I was extremely satisfied with with the way it looked and shined. However, the clasp was not able to open. I see some other people have had the same problem as well. Eventually, I was able to pry it open and tamper with it a little so now it opens and closes correctly. Now there are a few little scratch marks where I had to use pliers but I'll get over it. It doesn't make sense why the company wouldn't test their product before distributing it."
2.0,The glass face on the watch shattered within 24 hours of wearing it. The accessory bracelet was cheaper than expected. Returned both for refund. Thanks Amazon.
2.0,Looked nice I would have had to lose a link but i could not pull the stem out to set the watch.
2.0,Looks and wears like plastic; cheap look/feel.  I was expecting a more supple look/feel.  I would not order this item again.
2.0,Doesn't add any phone protection but it is nice to look at.
2.0,This had so much potential but unfortunately for me it just did not sit in the right spots. The sizing was correct but maybe my body wasn't correct for the size if that makes any sense.
2.0,Sorry not a scarf !! It’s not
2.0,Runs extremely small; I should've looked at the size chart as I would never reasonably consider a size 8 an XL.
2.0,The dress was pretty but shorten than I wanted.  I returned the dress.
2.0,"Not what I was expecting. Also, dress may fit better on taller people"
2.0,"Was way too small , purchased suit same size and fit was perfect or a little big<br />Can’t button vest"
2.0,I wore them 3 times and they would fall apart
2.0,Too short. Not as long as pictured. I am a 2XL but have a longer torso and breasts. My belly was poking out the bottom and i was extremely disappointed
2.0,Fabrics is to sheep
2.0,"this dress came in and was extremely short, would call a tunic, not a dress. Luckily while on vacation I had already packed bike shorts for my daughter or one of her Disney outfits would have been ruined. Also washed and the dress faded very fast, she's only worn once and looks like we have had it for years."
2.0,it shows everything i got a large for reviews usually wear a 6 and the zipper is so ficklee I sent back bc I was worried it would rip right open if I moved
2.0,Pretty disappointed with the fit of this dress.  I ordered a small (I'm usually a small to medium) and this dress fit me like a large. It looks like a tent.<br />It reminds me of a maternity style dress.<br />The fabric is nice and the color is nice but what good is that if if the fit is way off.
2.0,They were bigger than described and not really pleased.
2.0,"The prints are great, the print fabric is much softer than the inside. The inside fabric feels like paper and it a tad itchy."
2.0,If you are athletic built with bigger legs they will be hard to fit.  Waist and length was good but tight on legs
2.0,Cannot return it because I brought it overseas. Much too expensive to do so.<br /><br />Dissapointed. Total waste of money.
2.0,"After reading other reviews I decided I was fine with the lack of compression and just thought it was a good deal on a pack of undershirts, but they are not very long and the silky material rides up quite a bit, so they're not even great for that. Maybe for someone shorter they could be great!"
2.0,"The band is very bulky, pinches my skin, and wish it came with a protection for the glass. Not my favorite band. I do like the look, but uncomfortable."
2.0,"I knew to order large because of Asian sizing, but I am usually a M and ordered XXL. It fits like a small, is not beige colored or brown like I ordered but more of a periwinkle. Also strings fall apart easily. Seems to be made of yarn and is not stretchy."
2.0,These are very small going wear them in my second hole
2.0,Too small on the hips would recomend people to buy one zise bigger.
2.0,"I was absolutely thrilled and got many compliments til I washed it, it shrunk so small I'll never be able to wear it again"
2.0,This item’s fit is way too big. What's the point of compression if it doesn't fit snugly? The quality is very excellent though. Would it be possible to receive a small to replace this item?? I would happily switch my review to 5 stars.
2.0,"It’s pretty, but  watch battery lasted less than three weeks.  I have a small frame (5’5” and 125lbs), but the cuff is very tight on my wrist.  Will be returning."
2.0,"Beautiful earrings, when they first arrive... only took about a day or two for the silver finish you come off."
2.0,The size fit me as expected. The style was sewn differently from the pictures. This legs are more tapered all the way down the middle with fabric around the hip area to create the harem look.<br />. This style is very different from the ones I usually wear that are a more traditional flow design. The fabric is polyester which makes it easy to stain lighter colors.
2.0,They could've been cute because the design is nice but the workmanship and material are very cheap. It's also extremely narrow around the toes. I returned them.
2.0,Rips easy
2.0,Cute boots but the odor is so strong I can't stand to have them in the house. They will be returned .
2.0,"5'8&#34; 143lbs it fits fine. This is a cute enough dress but the color is significantly different, the material is itchy stiff and stinks the shipping took forever it's just not that great I wouldn't have purchased in a retail store for sure. It's a cheap dress do its cheaply made with cheap crap material."
2.0,Top Large bottom looks horrible. Returned.
2.0,"It was extremely Large thru the Bust area and seemed smaller they the hips.  I am normally a Med, but ordered the Large because the reviews I read said it fit small.  It might be OK, if I wore a large. Thin material"
2.0,It was really small and did not fit me well at all. The bottom was too big and the top was really small. I was not happy with it at all. The material felt really cheap. Definitely regretting this purchase.
2.0,Runs way small. Not much detail. Very ordinary
2.0,This dress runs really big. I'll wear it around the house.
2.0,Band slips off too easily when reaching for it out of your pocket. Decided to with a Secrid wallet. Ended up paying considerably more but it is quality.
2.0,Fell apart not even 2 days later
2.0,I purchased this bathing suit because I was looking for a suit that would cover my belly button and my surgical scars that are under my naval and unfortunately this bathing suit does not cover my navel at all like it shows in the pictures. It's a decent looking bathing suit but it's not what I wanted and it's definitely not what was advertised.
2.0,I like the style but the length is too short and the color was not brown. It was more coral.
2.0,"teeny tiny for an adult, I returned them and will purchase where I can actually see them.  No problem with return."
2.0,"I loved the way these glasses looked on line, but after receiving them, they are horrible. The fit is fine, but the color is nothing, even remotely close, to the picture. Wasted almost $20 on these, thank goodness I didn't pay more."
2.0,This fabric is the real stretchy kind that's thin and shows everything underneath.  It was cute but I didn't like the way it looked on.
2.0,"I bought this for my daughter who is 5'6&#34;, 175, and wears a size 10 in women's clothes. The suit fit as expected. The bad part is the material to the bottoms has worn thin already and is starting to fall apart. Unfortunately this suit will not last the summer."
2.0,Material frayed after first wash.
2.0,"The second something spills on the dress, the dress is permanently stained. No hand washing, Tide stick, or laundering will help."
2.0,Pattern/material made the shirt look cheap
2.0,Way to small. It was cheap so going to take a knife and make slices every 2-3 inches aeound the hat to see if that will allow it to stretch out. The ribbon on the outside should hide the cuts. Just need it for one night so hope I can make it work. I would say it is a 6 3/4 size. I wear a 7 1/2. Good for a female or a kid.
2.0,"Didn’t like the fit, fabric, or the thickness. And there was a hole in the sleeve near armpit brand new. Returned immediately."
2.0,No instructions in English.  Ice packs fall out when running which is what I primarily bought this for.  The Velcro did not hold them secure.  Adjustable straps work poorly for holding the vest securely so cool packs can have good skin contact
2.0,"The main issue I have is: there were no owner’s guide sheet to explain the workings of the watch’s feature, no help aid to show how to put the wrists straps on the watch. If you have a user’s guide for this watch, it would be appreciated. Thank you"
2.0,"I received the sweatshirt with a hole and a lousy stitching job.  Thread is already coming apart in several spots.  I doubt this one will last as long as my previous Russell Athletic sweatshirt after a few rounds in the washing machine.  Well, this is what I get for buying online--no opportunity to check out what I'm getting."
2.0,Found it very heavy for what was to be a light weight summer dress. Never wore it.
2.0,I have had this band for 3 days and it broke! The little clear piece for re-sizing snapped. It was very flimsy. Returning.
2.0,It's a really nice tie clip but the gold did not shine as expected. Overall it's OK.
2.0,"Not what I expected.  Should have returned.  If you do order, size up."
2.0,No me gustó para nada como se ve con la ropa. Las almohadillas se marcan en la ropa y no te hacen forma.
2.0,A cool necklace but the hook on mine broke when I tried to put it on and  I had to replace the hook myself. I don't know if anyone else will have this problem but it is a cool necklace.
2.0,"Necklace opens while wearing it. I almost lost it a few times, but it was only a few dollars"
2.0,"Very poorly constructed and very thin, flimsy material."
2.0,"The front has a seen down the middle, and the pattern doesn’t line up."
2.0,Cheap material. You get quality what you pay for. Of course very differently fit than model.
2.0,No cushion support around whole feet. But u get what you paid for.. inner insole bad . Outer looks nice and hasn’t came apart 3 months in.
2.0,"I returned both products, did not fit"
2.0,Cute little necklace not real but it’s cute I like it it broke the first time I wore it though
2.0,"That mannequin must be child sized because this hat is not nearly as baggy as in the picture. So, if you want a baggy hat for a child this will do nicely but for regular sized adult heads look elsewhere!"
2.0,"Love the dress, very comfortable. But faded on the first wash"
2.0,"The fabric is like a slip, seems strange in a child. It’s also fairly see through, we ended up not using it"
2.0,To big to my face
2.0,Usually I wear size XL but I bought XXL and its too small.
2.0,"I ordered XL, usually wear around a size 16 US and this was way too small, fits more like a medium or maybe even small. The waist stretches very little. Bummer."
2.0,This a hat with a couple of decals
2.0,Poor quality as compare to my first one from another store. Fit small. Not true to size.
2.0,I ordered a medium and I would say this is closer to a size XS. My 11 year old niece wouldn't even fit in it. It's very cheaply made and already unraveling at the seams. I'm very disappointed. I received this at a discount in exchange for an honest review.
2.0,Not the same as I ordered the first time the ear loops are the issue
2.0,"I know these are very inexpensive earrings, but buyer beware, you get what you pay for. They tarnished after one wearing. I was really sad because they did look very nice."
2.0,This is exactly what I was looking for unfortunately it wont stay tight around my wrist. I will probably give the green one away as I have never worn it.
2.0,The tag was laced within the lens frame and couldn't get it to come out without removing the lens...  I returned the item.  I think I would have like the glasses if the packaging and tag weren't messed up.
2.0,Rings are REALLY TINY!! Most of them didn't even fit on my pinky finger!
2.0,"I am giving this dress 2 stars because it does look beautiful once it's on and before it falls apart. The dress was very difficult to put on my 7 yr old and the lacing up the back wasn't easy either. After approximately 5 mins of wear, the flowery beaded decoration that is on the sash just fell off of the clip that attaches to the sash. We had no supplies with us to fix it (hot glue) so she had to go without it. The sash is a different shade of gold or champagne than what the ribbons are on the shoulders and the back tie ribbons. We tucked the sash ribbon in the back so it didn't clash with the back tie ribbon when they're both tied together. My daughter wore this dress for about 45 mins for a photo shoot and that was enough for her to not want to wear it again. I'm quite sure most wouldn't wear this dress more than once because it's just not well constructed. I would suggest finding another brand for your sweet girl. I'm attaching a photo to show how beautiful it is but still wouldn't purchase again."
2.0,I bought it to by baby spend Christmas and the t-shirt for a small baby that is always in our lap is not comfortable at all. It kept going up showing her belly. I would be much better if it was a body in the same color
2.0,It’s barely stronger than something I’d identify as flimsy. Plus the leaves get stuck in hair whenever I put my hair up it and playing with my kiddos hair.<br /><br />Would hard pass against this ring.
2.0,Pretty but to small Thanks
2.0,"Debating on returning this and I'm definitely leaning to that. These are WAY WAY SMALL.. my girl laughed. Hell, I laughed. For a guy the difference is like boxers or g string lol. But at least 1 size probably 2 bigger.<br />Otherwise they feel soft and appear to be of decent quality. I would post a picture but I wouldn't be able to stop laughing and my review would go virial."
2.0,They are not as pretty in person then they are on the screen. The rhinestone's are dull in color. They are a great gift for a little girl.
2.0,Falls off the shoulders but tight around the waist. Have to wear something underneath. Would not buy again
2.0,"I had to put gel insoles in these as I am on my feet all day on a concrete floor.  In addition, they scuff VERY easily....I have only had them for two weeks and they look like I've owned them for 10 years.  My boots they replaced still look brand new after 2 years of wear...."
2.0,I returned this item. The chain it came with was beautiful! But the pendant itself looked like cheap costume jewelry. Not luxurious and special
2.0,My skirt was not finished at the bottom. It was surged and that was it.. not folded and hemmed. And I wish that the slip (second piece of fabric)  was longer so you couldn’t see my legs through the skirt
2.0,"gave it away, didn't fit"
2.0,Looks much better in picture than in reality. Material and the quality are not great either. I returned it.
2.0,"The First pair had two round holes on upper right tigh and one hole on the left side.  after that every day one roun no-run hole appeared randomly!! The fact that they did not run, I could use the product for 5 days  till the lower holes became visible and it was it,I had to discard it after that!  I am a long time user of Hanes pantyhoses and up to this time directly ordered them from Hanes company, never had this problem before.  It must be product of this seller and probably old product that deteriorated.  Will never order from this seller again."
2.0,A long ankle pants was advertised...however a knee length pants was sent...and the color was blue
2.0,"Within one day of wearing this, a letter fell off. The next day, the apple stem broke. I don’t keep much on my lanyard so I was very disappointed that this wasn’t as durable as I would have liked it. The wooden apple, while cute, is cut too thin."
2.0,Had to trim the threads which made the craftsmanship look poor & uncaring.. Cute novelty item. Plan on giving it to a niece with birthday money in it.
2.0,It was a quality product but smaller than I expected.  I reordered in a size larger than I normally wear.  I'm hoping that fits better.
2.0,Is see-through. Not what I wanted at all!
2.0,I don't have super sensitive skin and found this material to be itchy
2.0,"This is a lovely dress, color, material and design but it was too small so I gave it to my daughter.  Would like another for myself."
2.0,"Food stain (I hope) on the collar, and the material was nubby as if already been worn/washed.  Too grossed out to keep it.  Style looked cute."
2.0,"This the sceond pair with the same problem. One of the ""little"" screws that holds the lens to the frame came out. Can't find a replacement!"
2.0,Plain.  Not very fancy.
2.0,Bracelet didn’t last long before it started to unravel.
2.0,"I bought the 2XL and it is far too small. I have a 36 inch waist, 44 inch hips, and 40 inch bust. I look like two pigs fighting under a blanket in this. Just absolutely overstuffed sausage."
2.0,Super thin material. Felt cheap. Cute pattern. If you have bigger boobs size up.
2.0,"This watch band would be okay for a kids watch but the quality is very low.  The orange color has no richness, looks cheesy, and the black holes bleed into the orange color.  So, for $8.00 you get what you pay for.  If your looking for a sharp look don’t bother with this product."
2.0,Spring broke almost immediately
2.0,Very small. I bought the largest size they had which was supposed to fit but it was still too small.
2.0,"For the price, I was a little upset about the fact that I had to glue the rainbow back on."
2.0,Size up one or two
2.0,"Bought these for my 2yo to walk around the hard wood floors. I think his feet are more comfortable walking on solid ground. There are no insoles. Zero cushion  between his feet and the hard sole. No arch support at all. And the glue is so sloppy at the bottom. Terrible quality for the price. Should’ve been $6.00 maybe. They are cute, but I’m surprised that more people aren’t commenting on the poor quality and discomfort of the shoe. Poor kids walking around in these all day has to get painful after a while."
2.0,"This shirt is made of almost see through material, very cheap. I would not buy again and NOT true to size."
2.0,"The watch was much smaller then the picture indicated, perhaps meant for a child or woman. The strap was too small and binding on the hand. Light was weak. Hard to read the time. I made a mistake purchasing this watch."
2.0,Muy corta la cadena
2.0,"Really cute but run very small. Ordered a size up and still too small digging into my hips. Have to return, Ordered a large.<br /><br />Reference 5'7 154lbs 37in hips"
2.0,"Someone cheaped out on the polymer sand/ beads that inflate with water,  the part that keeps you cool. Seems to have about half of what is needed.  The stitches seem adequate and the fabric is a moderate quality,  but you will probably want to use 2 to have water beads on both sides of your neck"
2.0,Have had these for a week now and my child has broke two of the straps.
2.0,"I have purchased numerous orders of these socks and typically quality is very good. However, I have received BAD batches at times with shorter sock lengths (don’t reach calf) and lesser compression which I can only ascribe to quality control issues.<br /><br />If this recurring problem is fixed, I will continue to be a loyal customer.<br /><br />BTW... I gave feedback on company website but never heard back from them!!😔"
2.0,"I ordered an XL, which normally translates to a 16 which is what I wear.  It came, I pulled it on, and I could not get it snapped in the crotch.  It was about the size of a 12 or even a 10.  If you don't want to have it just sitting in your closet, don't get this.  But it looked pretty and the material was thick and durable."
2.0,Came curled up in a plastic bag and after 3 weeks still haven’t straightened out. Really aggravating
2.0,"This dress looks *good* overall, but I was disappointed with the fit. The material is stretchy and an okay quality, but definitely not top-notch. I'm 5'4"", 129 lbs, 34B bra size and the XS was too big, especially on my chest and in length. I normally would have chosen a size Small or even Medium, but sized down because of the reviews. With heels, the dress was still on the floor. Overall, the dress looks good but size down 1-2 sizes depending on your chest size. I'll be returning."
2.0,Had to return. Awkward top for bottom size.
2.0,Took a long time to get here and it doesn’t even fit my 4 month old!
2.0,Did not fit over my D boobs.
2.0,Pretty but do not stay in.
2.0,"Didn't like the quality, very little detail."
2.0,It's a Nice plaid and the oversized is perfect but it sheds all over everything so if you don't plan on wearing this with anything besides something white it's no good
2.0,Bad Quality. I don't like it
2.0,"Ordered a youth extra small, looks more like an adult small. Way to big for our kid. Only keeping as he likes the hat and sweat bands."
2.0,"Cute for smaller size females. Maybe if I got a bigger size it would have worked but that was not an option. I got a XL, I normally wear a L. It was not flattering around the hip/thigh area. Rhinestones kept falling off and had a strong chemical smell. I will be returning!"
2.0,Inaccurate description. Masks weren't all purple as pictured. They all have a big white border around them... was hoping to get what I paid for.
2.0,Too big for a woman's hands.
2.0,Not as cute in person. Sent back.
2.0,Based on the photo of this product given when shopping I had the impression you were selling 3 pairs together but I only got one pair. Seems deceptive. They seem to be nice but I won't be buying these socks again.
2.0,Size ran very small for an XXL. I expected it to feel slightly loose but was tight. Material felt very thin.Colors were very nice.
2.0,The durags are way to small like damn near kids size the wave cap was perfect tho.
2.0,disapointed in fabric
2.0,Really cute. Broke after two days. You can't just restring it either.
2.0,Get two sizes bigger.
2.0,The color is beautiful. The sizing.? Is ridiculous...4 sizes to small.  Even after other reviews and I ordered larger.  Offer is half price for return or pay postage. Hopefully I can give it away.
2.0,Product sizing was way off!!  Needed it for a funeral.
2.0,It was a very pretty set but the earring posts were too thick to use. And the silver playing came off of the ring after less than two weeks.
2.0,"It started to get scratched up on the first day. Also it was a bit too big for my 5 inch wrist, so I ended up returning it. The color match was really good though. Not quite my style in the end."
2.0,"One wear, neck began to roll and stretch out.<br />First wash and the collar is still stretched out.  Do. Not recommend"
2.0,"I ordered this for my mother. She ordered a pink XL, thinking it would be oversized. She received a lavendar gown that was very small."
2.0,"I ordered the cobalt blue color, and it was more of a turquoise color--WAS--because I sent it back.  I returned it not just because I didn't like the color, but it didn't work for me.  I tried to put my checkbook into one of the folds, and it kept getting caught on the sides of the pocket and would not insert all the way.  I have no idea what was preventing it from easily sliding inside, being that it's a standard size checkbook (with most of the checks torn off).  I'm bummed because I like purchasing products made in USA.<br /><br />I wish folks would better understand what color cobalt blue actually is.  Without getting into the chemical make-up, the color should resemble a mix of purple and deep blue.  The photo shows cobalt glass (smalt) or true cobalt blue color next to the wallet.  While I didn't expect the wallet to precisely match the cobalt blue glass, the wallet's color was more like a cross between turquoise (greenish blue) and sky blue."
2.0,"if you have a big bust it will not fit no matter the size, I had to give mine away and three of my co workers tried it on and it did not fit them in the chest area"
2.0,Quality seems ok but was wayyyy too big sizing is definitely off. The 6-12 month would prob fit a 5 year old
2.0,"We have had a  stretch of no summer rain storms in the last few weeks  here in Nashville. So this Safety green cycle raincoat has mostly been hanging in my closet waiting to be tested. While I've been waiting, I have figured out how to fold this very lightweight jacket into it's back pocket and into a small football shape to be lugged around in the back pocket of a cycle jersey. All fine and good. I also tried on this nylon beauty over my cycle gear and stood in front of a mirror checking out it's fit. I'm 6' tall and 153 lbs, a slender build. I bought a size  medium jacket. It fit pretty well, and by that I mean relatively body hugging which is what I want in cycle gear.  I won't wear cycle clothes that flap in the wind. Sleeves were adequate on my arms which normally take a 34"" dress shirt sleeve, although I wish the jacket sleeves were 1 inch longer.<br /><br /> A week ago a light rain threatened, so I eagerly grabbed this dayglo beauty and tucked it in my jersey. About an hour into my ride I felt a few drops, so I quickly donned the raincoat. This was a typical hot summer day in Nashville, muggy and sweaty. The rain was so light that I couldn't judge its weatherproof abilities, but it was obvious that this jacket didn't breathe all that well in humid heat.<br /><br />Yesterday, finally, thunderstorms were predicted for the afternoon. Once again I loaded the jacket into my cycle jersey pocket and off I went. Lightening! Thunder! Rain started quick and heavy. On went the jacket. Immediately I noticed that the sleeves were wet and plastered to my arms, which were not dry, but completely soaked! The temperature dropped to around 69 degrees and the rain was colder. Not only was this jacket not waterproof, it wasn't even water resistant! Now my back was getting drenched as I cycled the 8 miles home.  I quickly realized that this jacket was actually keeping me wetter and colder than if I wasn't wearing it at all!! And windproof? Forget it! I felt every cold tentacle that Aeolus, keeper of the winds, threw at me.  The absurdity of my predicament left me with nothing left to do but smile, smile, smile. I was laughing out loud furiously pedaling to outrun the cold rain. Futile! Utter failure!<br /><br />This is the first raincoat that guarantees the wettest ride you've ever had. I feel fortunate that the storm I sailed through was on a hot October day, or I might have ended up in a hospital shivering with hypothermia. The last 3 miles of my ride was through Nashville's downtown traffic. Drenched, I was grateful that at least the jacket was a bright safety green, a beacon of sunshine amid the deluge and cars. Downtown tourists and passers by couldn't understand my hysterical guffawing as I struggled up Demonbreun St. But I knew that I had been outwitted by the weather Gods and laughed at their mighty victory. Zeus/Jupiter god of the sky, rain, lightning and thunder, have mercy on me! You have punished me for my miserly foolishness. I should have listened to your stern advice and spent heavily on Goretex if my desire was to stay dry.  How can I repent? How can I redeem myself in your eyes? What is that you say? Spray a fabric waterproofing spray on my green rag of a coat and pray for forgiveness? Yes, I will. I will! You say 303 fabric guard works well? OK. Yes. I will give it a try. I am humbled. I beseech thee, forgive my foolishness!<br /><br />UPDATE: I twice sprayed a waterproofing agent normally used on Sunbrella fabrics (303 Fabric Guard) on this terrible jacket, following the directions exactly. I went out yesterday in a light but steady downpour for a 15 mile ride. And guess what? I was drenched as though Zeus at undone my waterproofing. The water beaded a bit better leading me to think I had accomplished my goal, but I was just as soaked as though I had done nothing! If you want to stay dry get Goretex or stay in bed!"
2.0,Loved the dress until I found a hole in it.
2.0,"Super cute but too short! I’m normally a xs/s and sized up to a medium and this barely covers my butt. Super cute tunic, plan to wear with leather leggings but would not recommend as a dress."
2.0,"i’ve bought these leggings in 3 colors and wanted a new pair so got a new color. for some reason the blue aren’t as compressing as my other pairs from the same brand, these are also more see through. i wouldn’t recommend for a leg day or cardio"
2.0,This is nice but it tarnished too quickly
2.0,Way to snug for me.
2.0,The watch was nice to look at but only wore it twice and a piece of the watch on front display fell off an its stopping the second hand from moving
2.0,"bottoms too big, top no support at all."
2.0,Dress didn’t fit and was sent back immediately.  Refund was never issued.  Size 18 fits like 20. Also took a month to arrive.
2.0,"very, very small. ordered an XL for an adult, but i think they shipped an XL for Barbie. i'm sure they would work just fine if they were made to fit the size they advertised."
2.0,Very thin. The hems are laughable- I can see this unraveling quickly. It doesn't look like the picture at all lol. I got a bright red long sleeve basic undershirt.
2.0,I love these glasses but they just broke in half in my hands for no reason. I've only had them for a week and have never dropped them. I'd like a new pair or a refund please.
2.0,"I purchased a large, as I wear a size 12 ordinarily. The shirt is cute and the fabric is soft, but it was too small through the shoulders and bust. I gave it to my daughter-in-law."
2.0,"Stone fell out, luckily we found it.  Put glue e6000 on top tip to holds in place, problem solved."
2.0,"Upon opening the packaging, it looked like spider webs inside. Is this normal?<br />It’s pretty gross"
2.0,"The dress hung on my body very well, but the 'holes' in the arms were huge - so much so it was showing most of my arm and looked horrible.<br />Not the best quality fabric (jersey like), but it was comfortable.  Just not stylish and a good fit for my body."
2.0,Poor quality and small around the bust area. Not a good fitted warp dress.
2.0,"I've owned several pairs of great sunglasses and really liked similar models. This pair was a cheap version of a good shape. The plastic is hard and that is the most distasteful difference between the ""Rip"" and ""low rider"". The optics are good though..."
2.0,Changed color fast
2.0,Breaks easily but cute.
2.0,"I'm 5'2 and weigh 140 lbs. My measurements are 36C bra, 27 in waist and 36 in waist. I ordered a medium and it's way too big. The straps fall down and its really loose around my waist."
2.0,"It's nice it really is, and the size is just right. But after a couple days of wear it the hoop where the chain goes into broke, and the base of the pendant has turned a dark black color. :/ it's a shame because i really did like it"
2.0,"Although it specifies assorted with printed and solid colors, none of what I received looked like the pictures. The solid ones did not have the colored trim. The printed ones do not resemble any of the ones advertised.<br />I'm a consistent size medium and ordered that size. They fit like a side small. This has to be junior sizing. Disappointed to say the least."
2.0,Fits nice but is super seethrough
2.0,Very small and cut off the circulation
2.0,Sorry I bought these earrings. Small and flimsy.
2.0,Seemed like decent quality but it runs small. I had to return it as it was much too tight. I wear 7 5/8.
2.0,"The color does not look like the pic.  It looks like a print based on a marker coloring.  Also the front is much shorter than the pic.  It was at the bottom of my belly button, and I'm 5'6&#34;.  I ordered a large.  I wear my tank tops at the top of my legs (like the picture). The one thing I will say is the cut was very cute and flattering in the back."
2.0,"The pearls are lovely, although they do not have as much luster as the online photos.<br /><br />The reason for only two stars are the clasps. They hurt my ears once in (not sure if it's some kind of allergic reaction?) and only the smaller piece of clasp is marked 14k. The wider side that shows when you wear them is NOT marked 14k and has black tarnish inside. The wires that goes into your ears are also not marked 14k. That makes me question if only a small part of the clasp is 14k.<br /><br />I posted a photo showing the inside of the side that's not marked 14k. Some of what's inside is a shadow, but there are also tiny blackish spots on the metal.<br /><br />In any case, I don't like the way they look and they are uncomfortable to wear."
2.0,Shoe was somewhat large and the glue shows to much where the rose is attached to the shoe and rose could easily come off.
2.0,Cute necklace but not luminous.
2.0,"I bought this because it says it is a &#34;Varsity Jacket&#34;, but it isn't a Varsity jacket AT ALL.  It's a sweater.  I'm very disappointed.  I'll probably be returning it because it was very expensive for a sweater."
2.0,"I purchased these because I thought they were really cute and small enough where I could wear them to work. After wearing the clear pair three times, the ball fell off and I haven't put on another pair since; it was quite the disappointment."
2.0,"I really like the shirt.  It was just what I wanted.  However, I wore it once, and then the stitching holding the sequins on started coming undone right away.  I haven't washed it.  I have done nothing that would cause this kind of wear so quickly, but now I cannot wear it again."
2.0,Not upto expectation. Ok for the price but not the product i would have liked it
2.0,"When I tried to put these on the very first time I heard little tears again and again as seams or threads broke.  So that was that, honestly, and I returned them.<br /><br />It's too bad because I LOVE the fabric and the print!  They're very stretchy, fit perfectly otherwise, and made my booty look, well, what do you think?!  (See pic)  They're fierce and fun and I was really looking forward to them, only for quality issues to ruin it.  Maybe I got a lemon pair, so to speak, it happens.  oh well.  If they fix the stitching issues I'd definitely try them again."
2.0,"Meh. It’s a little shorter than I’d like, the material is heavy and a button fell off the second time I wore it. The pocket is also down too low."
2.0,"I bought two of these tops in March 2015- size M, fit well with great draping/cut (5'9, 152lb, 36C, 29 waist, 34&#34; inseam, long torso).  A few weeks ago, I went ahead and reordered several more of same colors in medium.  When they arrived, I thought the manufacturer must have mislabled them as they were at least twice as big, hung off my frame.  I washed two of them to see if shrinking might help- no change in size, still way too big with cuffs on sleeves even bigger in proportion to rest of tunic.  (Sleeves on my original mediums are close-fitting.)  I re-ordered small and x-small, both are also bigger than my mediums purchased 8 months ago.  The XS may have worked but the neckline was very broad, exposed both bra straps completely- almost seemed the neck was cut and sewn wrong.  I'm sending all back, will try one last time for XS in the colors I need to see if they can work.  So disappointed because the mediums are my favorite go-to blouses."
2.0,They were very tight and the material was not what I expected but they are okay for an around the house pant.
2.0,The fabric on this dress is thin and the slit is surprisingly high. I returned it immediately.
2.0,Broke after two weeks of wearing it.
2.0,not very good for skinny face people makes you look like a duck Bill on your face where seams come together
2.0,"Bra was WAY too small.  I ordered my usual size, but the cross straps didn’t cross enough.  Very disappointed"
2.0,The photo is cute.  It looks kinda cheap in real life.  And the back of the shirt doesn't make a &#34;V&#34; like the front.  It just looks like a flimsy half circle of material.
2.0,This fit my son a little stiffly and weird where the zipper goes over the pocket area. We returned it with no problems.
2.0,The size was 2 size smaller .
2.0,"These are really good while they last. They are good for kids that don't have bridges (I. E. My Asian kids). Those goggles are hard to find. However, they appear the be cheaply made. We have gone through three in a few months. The seal between the plastic and rubber separates after time. There is another brand that looks very similar to these and the seal lasts longer and the goggles them selves are a little softer. The frame of this one is stiff."
2.0,Not kid appropriate.  The character appears to be holding his middle finger up which I did not notice until my son had the shirt on.  He cannot wear this to school.
2.0,Cute but too narrow at the hips for my 99 year old mom.
2.0,Takes up a huge amount of space in my suitcase. I was very excited to get it but it doesn't fit in my carry on and takes up a lot of space in my checked bag.
2.0,"I bought this for my 11 month old daughter who is just moving into 12 month sized clothes.  All of the other Carters' 12 month clothes that we have are slightly too big on her.  The pants fit fine, but the onesie is too small in weird ways.  The head is way too small (she is in the 40th percentile for head size), and the shoulders seem tight.  I'm very disappointed in this outfit.  I bought it a month ago and have already washed it, so I won't be able to return it.  I'm glad I got it on sale."
2.0,Beautiful color and fit as expected. Disappointed that the waistband was not sewn appropriately and the elastic is exposed the whole way around...started to return but not worth the hassle.
2.0,"I’m 5’6, 131lbs and these were extremely tight on me. I could pull it off if the mesh wasn’t in the middle of the thigh. The mesh created a “muffin top” on my thighs and it looked horrible.<br />They will be returned. I got another 2 pairs of different design and I’m keeping those.<br />Otherwise they are good quality, they keep everything in place. The mesh looks like it’s a good quality but this design just didn’t work for me. It would be perfect for someone who has very skinny legs."
2.0,"I don't have a giant booty but the pants ripped like I was Nicki Minaj. They felt thick and fit nicely, but the drawstring didn't help the pants stay around my waist. An awkward fit. I received these on Christmas Eve, wore them on Christmas Day. I didn't even make it to Christmas dinner before I had a big hole on my left cheek. Perhaps these run small."
2.0,Too short for me.
2.0,The chain on gold belt broke the first time I wore it out. Returned the set.
2.0,Way to big! Very disappointed!
2.0,One of these earrings was scratched on the table of the cz. They fell awkwardly forward on the ear due to the placement of the post.
2.0,"Way too thin. It fit good, but it’s definitely not going to last very long."
2.0,"These capris are huge, I could have worn a small in them? Nice material though. Sent them back."
2.0,There was not very much compression
2.0,These pants fit so well and I got a ton of compliments. The reason for the low stars? The material is such a thin low quality after the first wash I did in gentle cold cycle and air dried. (I was careful because the material seemed low quality) After a few wearings and I mean 2 or 3 it started to fray and the material look just old and had a worn look but it was still new. The buttons on the front of the pants a started to chip and the paint(Yeah they were painted a bronze color) started to wear off in chunks and were literally hanging by a thread. Sigh. I am so sad because the color and style is just so cute but its such BAD quality. I love high waisted vintage pants but they are so hard to find and these fit perfect.
2.0,The cups are way smaller than they should be. I like the material and concept of the bra. Just needs bigger cups.
2.0,Not crazy about the material. Not what I expected.  Cheap
2.0,It didn't come out like the picture .
2.0,It looks cheap and the shipping and handling cost more than the necklace.  It is best suited as part of a costume.
2.0,"They were way too small for my size 10 feet, very thin material too"
2.0,It's a gorgeous necklace. But here's why I only gave it 2 stars. I wore it for less than 5 hours and it the necklace part broke. I never even pulled on it. But it broke!! I was very disappointed....  but if you have another  necklace you can put the charm on it. It's not very durable. If I could with out touching it and it break. But none the less it looks exactly like the picture and pretty.
2.0,Had to return because the strap was too short for me. I’m 5’9 so maybe that’s why.
2.0,These are not my favorite and kind of ugly in person.. they feel cheaply made & the lens are dark but you can still see through them so not dark enough. I’ve worn them a handful of times and when I do I feel childish. I do not recommend.
2.0,I didn’t expect this to be super high quality but when it was delivered pieces were broken and the glasses wouldn’t open. The picture made it look way better than it did once received!
2.0,"The Velcro isn't very good on these. Won't work for my very active little boy. Looks good on his foot, but we can't use these, unfortunately."
2.0,My 4 year old loves fancy Nancy and I was so excited to get these for her!!! However the toe on one has ink stain on it :(
2.0,Bigger than pictured
2.0,"Do not look like picture, very small, writing on earring not clear! Very disappointed."
2.0,Lingerie like.
2.0,Something about it looks like the disposable 3D glasses you get at the movies.  It is certainly oversized which I wanted but something about it looks cartoonish or like its missing the BIG fake nose attached.  My search continues
2.0,"This is a beautiful product I bought for my wife, but the size runs WAY small!"
2.0,Wanted to wear but way too big
2.0,"It looks nice as the picture , but when I wear it the SECOND time , that long part fall down<br />It is NOT well attached<br />It breaks VERY Easily<br />And you are wasting your money"
2.0,"Very nice but Runs large ..i ordered my usual size 8 and it is huge.  It is not a mini dress as advertised.  I’m 5’5” and it comes right below my knee.  Also, you have to pay shipping to return."
2.0,cap needs to be adjustable
2.0,I really love the material but these panties are awful looking and unflattering 😕
2.0,"The waste is true to size, The material is comfortable,caveat i have only had them a week,so I truly can not answer to their durability.The main reason why I am giving it only two stars is that the front pouch is too darn small (really no humble boast here it really is small).At this price point I guess you get what you pay for.I will probably hand them down to my nine year old. Hopefully they will fit him."
2.0,I used shoegoo and they are still falling off... I'm kinda disappointed. They worked well for the 4 outings I used them on. I use a cart every round and so my actual walking use is extremely limited and they still are falling out and you don't notice. So at this point I've got a few left on there and that gonna be it. I don't know that I would reorder unfortunately.
2.0,"This tracksuit runs big. The top is fine, however the pants are not jegging’s, not tight or fitted, especially around the ankle as pictured & described. The pants are extra looseat the ankles and they are more like flarebottom casual pants pants"
2.0,"I ordered these because they were all supposed to be the same size and that’s what I wanted for my 3 nose piercings, 3 same size hoops in a row. NOPE! They were all different sizes. Oh well, you get what you pay."
2.0,Cheap fabric and will do for casual everyday. Save your money and get a good quality blazer from Jones of NY.
2.0,Seems like everything made in China has its own size chart. They are always off by a size or two. Their products never quite the same as the pics on line. Actual product is much shorter.
2.0,They’re smaller than I thought. Really don’t like them for everyday wear. I like larger frames than these. Appear larger than they really are.
2.0,I should have ordered a 2x because large was too small
2.0,"Only two stars because although I did like the fit itself, the length was absolutely wrong. The picture shows the dress being ankle-length well below ankle length. The dress didn't reach my ankle. I am 5 6 and ordered a xxxl"
2.0,"I ordered size 44x32 and would expect a much longer rise in pleated pants in that size. Waist and length were fine, but stride is cut too short so pants crumple at crotch and pull tight across thighs.  They're going back."
2.0,It's doesn't really look like the picture. Or maybe i'm just too small :(
2.0,Meh it’s made for a toddler
2.0,Not the same color as picture and fit is not right even after following measurements....
2.0,"The hat is weak, the embroidery of the Unit is a piece of Paper, the hat is put together like crap, and only worthy of sending it back."
2.0,Sits way too low.
2.0,"I expected a bright red, but it was more of a deep pink."
2.0,definitely from china<br />fitting on watch is subpar
2.0,They are not adjustable to your toe finger size. Even the smallest adjustment was bigger for my toes.
2.0,"I am 5'5"" and about 150lbs, so normally I wear a large or a size 12. I bought the L/XL size based on several things: (1) the fact that it's the size I normally buy, (2) the company's sizing chart, and (3) the reviews from other women here on Amazon who stated they were about my size and that the L/XL fit them just right. I was a little surprised when these leggings wouldn't even go past the middle of my thigh, especially given that they were meant to fit people in the XL range too. I actually checked the packaging to verify bc I thought I'd been sent the wrong size, but nope. They were a pretty thick material and not very stretchy at all. Pretty color, but I had to return bc they were WAY too small."
2.0,not made really well  the cape  does not lay properly on shoulder
2.0,The print was the only thing that I liked about this item.  It was very Papery feeling so thin I feel like the buttons would just rip off after a couple uses and it was also delivered missing a button completely
2.0,"ALERT - THE ""PINK"" IS ACTUALLY A TANGERINE COLOR"
2.0,"It fits my width, but not my length. The pads for the bra completely miss my breasts, and I'm not busty by any means. I'd skip if you aren't petite."
2.0,"Love the design, but the material is too soft and clingy."
2.0,It is the right fit on the shoulders but then it is like you're swimming in the product. It's awful.
2.0,"Love the boots, hate that they can’t be worn! Both of my ankles look like this after wearing them for the day."
2.0,Had great potential but arrived frayed with threads sticking out. This shirt also arrived smelling like cigarette smoke. Gross.
2.0,Nice but not up to my standards. Torn in about a month
2.0,Odd fit and lines - haven't tried it on yet but not sure how it will look. Sleeves appear to be quite slim as well.
2.0,so cheap looking but it was cheap-- the pic looks wayyy better
2.0,"Very nice looking. Bought in my favorite color, red, and looks great. Unfortunately it’s nice easy to use, hard to unzip and the opening isn’t as big as the purse itself."
2.0,"These are very cute, but the part that inserts in the ear is BAD.  It bent going into my ear.  I can bend it back, but it shouldn't do that.  I know these are going to last long so I will wear them sparingly."
2.0,Straps broke on all of the tanks within first couple of wears.
2.0,"The watch is fine (especially at the value pricing).  Unfortunately, the mesh band is completely unusable. The magnetic clasp simply is not capable of sustaining connectivity under the weight of the watch... Be ready to spend more on a new strap than you will pay for the watch itself."
2.0,I wish the pants came in a high-waist style. They're too short in the rise. I have to wear a very long top over them and be careful not to bend over!
2.0,Super short!! Had to return it :(
2.0,Unfortunately this is my review for this Winkine Women Tote Bag.<br /><br />I ordered this tote bag with the assumption that I would receive what was pictured here on Amazon. Unfortunately that is not what happened. When I opened the box the first thing I noticed was that the tote bag was missing the FOB chain that's in all the pictures. It was actually the thing that attracted me to this tote bag in the first place. So already I was really disappointed. Then I opened the bag and noticed a few issues that could be a problem with future use.<br /><br />1. The bag is smaller than I expected. Doesn't seem like it would hold very much<br /><br />2. The color is completely different than pictured here. The front of my bag is almost all the darker black color with very little of the red color. Also the colors are in reversed order from the pictured version here.<br /><br />3. The material on the inside of the bag feels like a very low quality paper almost. It makes loud sounds like its made of the same stuff as those &#34;swooshy&#34; pants lol. Feels like it would rip with any heavy use.<br /><br />I've sent an email to try to get this resolved and hopefully receive the missing key chain piece but from other reviews on here I don't know if it'll ever get fixed. I will update if I hear from the seller.<br /><br />Overall not worth the price in my opinion.<br /><br />*** I was given this item for free or at a discount for my honest review ***
2.0,Cute but charm fell off after first wearm
2.0,"The flounce at the neckline was a bit more than I could handle. It did not seam to drape as nicely as it does int he picture online. The fit was OK, it was big for me around the rib area. The closure at the back would have needed to be ablout 2&#34; narrower for it to fit me properly."
2.0,Armholes flare out at bottom revealing bra
2.0,"Albeit cute, these earrings made my 2nd hole lobe piercings (of 15+ years) become infected for the first time since they were pierced. No good!"
2.0,Doesn't look as good in-person
2.0,DID NOT LIKE THE FIT.  ARMHOLES VERY BIG.
2.0,"The flap was too much for me, returned."
2.0,"I've never gotten to wear a pair from this pack more than once as they all rip within the 1st hour of being on. I even tested this twice by purchasing a second set, unfortunately yielding the same results. I know they aren't super pricey, but it feels like a waste when you have to throw them away when you get home."
2.0,This watch was awesome the band didn't last a month though!
2.0,Unfortunately my one side of my earrings are now in two parts. The hook is separated from the pearl. What are my options in having it repaired.
2.0,"The very bad quality of the seams. The first washed it uncovered. The sleeve is broken.<br />Measures which are taken into account in the chart offering. doesn’t include the shoulders. And the tshirt fabric doesn’t expand much, as one is accustomed.<br />If the chart is medium, take the sleeves into consideration.<br />I must also say that the color and the letters are very nice and after washing, (which has only been once) they look exact and bright."
2.0,The wood split when trying to resize it. The pins were almost immovable. Maybe the wood swelled because of the humidity? I am sending it back. It is a handsome and unique looking watch though which is why I gave it two stars instead of just one.
2.0,I purchased two colors.  Both very pretty but one of the straps broke on each piece the first time wearing it.  Sending both back.
2.0,"I was so excited to wear this for my birthday. My name is Rose so I ordered a Rose,I got bethany the necklace itself looks nice tho"
2.0,"Looks Great, fit perfect but broke at the smallest tug, didnt last but 2hours"
2.0,"These dresses are NOT constructed for a curvy woman. ... no room for hips, nor “the girls! Even ordered a size larger than what I usually wear...Lots of construction issues:additionally loose threads, fabric patterns not in alignment at all, even missed seams causing a hole, & lots of bunched up tangled thread anywhere there’s a seam. Very cheaply made. HEADS UP! ...it will end up costing you double (return shipping to China) if you want to exchange or get a refund. Again, if you have ANY curves, these dresses are not going to fit. Too frustrating & disappointing to shop any NoraCora."
2.0,Was not too happy with the fit and look of this hat. I ended up returning it.
2.0,The quality of the leather is good and its a handsome belt but the ratchet pops loose several times a day
2.0,"The watch works fine, but the small piece that holds the strap down broke after my granddaughter put it on for the third time.  We are now using a tiny turquoise rubber band to hold the strap in place."
2.0,doesn't seem to fit my face well or stay in place while I sleep.
2.0,"Too big- falls off my face. I thought the glasses are oversized on the lenses. Turns out, the frame is oversized."
2.0,Way too small. Fits probably 4t and smaller
2.0,Comfy strap. Just comes loose every few minutes and becomes longer
2.0,"This product is very cute and came a little later than the other products I ordered. However, The bottom of the shoes is very flimsy so I wouldn't recommend if your toddler or walking infant to use them for very long. Not very sturdy shoes."
2.0,The patterns cause the materials to gather around my cankles.
2.0,This broke the very first time I put it on the snap button came off. I know it was a cheap product price wise but I really figured I could have gotten some uses out of it.
2.0,I thought these might be more like gym shirts but they very very thin and almost see through. I'll use them for pajama bottoms now .
2.0,The green pair of sunglasses have hair melted in to the frame...
2.0,Trabajo en una compañía de renta de audio y cuando fui adolescente hacia Dj. Me gusto el diseño del disco de acetato. Luciendo un poco  retro. Pero la calidad no me convenció. Yo se que el precio lo dice todo. Pero quisiera algo de mejor calidad  un que costará más dinero. El diseño si me gusto.
2.0,Was too big...  I could not use it....
2.0,Very small and I’m unable to resize it. I kept it because it’s still a nice hat and my friend might want to have it.
2.0,This is poorly made and took almost a month to get to me!
2.0,wouldn't stay in position when clipped on my glasses so returned them without problem
2.0,"Looks nice, the tool it comes with works great for getting the band to the correct size. Unfortunately in the 3 days I've worn it, it's come off 2 times and I almost lost the watch 1 of those times. The band doesn't connect to the watch very well, it always seems loose."
2.0,"Attractive, but can't be worn as an ear cuff. No way to secure it in place. All it has is a traditional pierced ear deal,<br />which is on the other side of the dragonfly. It looks weird hanging down from the ear lobe."
2.0,Hard to breathe with it on. Plastic fogs up so person can not read your lips.
2.0,The way the buttons and the straps are sewn on this are not centered. Frustrating and will likely have to just resew.
2.0,Terrible quality!!!! Yea this will be going back back!!
2.0,"Fabric is very this, almost sheer. The quality and way it is cut is very low quality. Very sad. Be sure to look at customers pictures before purchasing. Wish I would have."
2.0,"I shopped based on my measurements, the info was not accurate on their size chart. Color was nice and material wasn't see through, fairly thin tho."
2.0,Bought these Feb 2018 for a trip to Europe. After wearing them for a week the zipper on both glove broke off. I dont recommend these gloves.
2.0,Very hard and uncomfortable.
2.0,I purchased it in January. I loved it when I first got it. Then within a month the lip on the clasp broke so I had to use a rubber band to keep it closed. then the plastic latch came off all together. Don't know if it had a warranty but couldn't find a way to contact the seller. Kinda disappointed.
2.0,"I really wanted to love this ring, for the heartbeat factor of it, but when it arrived, didn't look anything like this. I received it, and it was bent and smushed together like one of the other reviewers posted, even though it was in bubble wrap packaging. It's pretty pliable metal, so I was able to separate out the lines a bit, but it's still not straight like in the photo. It's a bit wavy, so it looks a little bit like a fancy Z for Zorro or something. I don't want to continue trying to straighten it out and risk snapping the metal.<br /><br />Worth the price I guess, and I know what it's supposed to stand for, but I wouldn't order it again."
2.0,"Ordered 16g 8mm and although the sizing is correct, the stones are soooo small that they look like flecks of metal. In the trash they went."
2.0,"This might work for shorter people, but not me. I am 6'2&#34; and this stopped right at my waste. However, I would have greatly preferred it to have stopped lower. Perhaps just under my pockets."
2.0,Sending it back. Got it in yellow and the lining is see through. It's also too tight for my liking.
2.0,"This dress is supposed to be “blue tie dye”, and it is more like a hot pink tie dye, with a little blue here and there. The pattern of the tie dye on the dress I got was very unflattering and brought a lot of attention to my stomach. I am in pretty good shape, curvy, and a mom of two, and have a little tummy I like to hide. This dress did nothing for that. I expected this dress to have a second layer, it does not, it’s very thin. I own other dresses that are a similar style, but from a different brand, and are double layered. This dress needs another layer, and it would fit a lot nicer and would’ve given me more confidence to wear it. I don’t like wearing a slip or anything like that under my dresses. I will say, that it was a nice length and the slit was sewn together, so no “free shows” could happen. I’m not sure if it’s see through, but it could possibly be in bright light or in the sun. It reminds me of somewhat of a swimsuit material. This is getting returned."
2.0,"Order AT LEAST a size up. Spandex material, looks and feels like active wear compared to a basic pull over"
2.0,"I ordered a red and white skirt which were packed together. Upon opening, white skirt is pink due to the red skirt."
2.0,"The product was not what I expected, first when I opened it it smelled of mildew. So I figured I better wash it before I give it as a gift to my niece and upon further inspections there were two holes in it. Its too long also, you would have to wrap it around you several times. It was not expensive so I guess you get what you pay for sometimes."
2.0,This is beautiful in white with white lace but it has no support.  I am disappointed-  only a size a or b should try it.
2.0,"I previously ordered a different style by same brand.  it ran REALLLY small.<br />cute, but small !!<br />so, I thought i'd try a different style but order up.<br />wow.  even ordering up 2 sizes didn't help.<br />not very much &#34;give&#34; or stretch.<br />I broke a nail trying to zip this up.  it took SEVERAL tries to zip this up !!<br />it looks like a neoprene fabric in the picture.  it is just plain ole polyester.<br />with no spandex.<br />itz cute though.<br />it was delivered directly from China.<br />plus side is I ordered directly from china via amazon.<br />on the flip side, these are Chinese sizes.  do Chinese women NOT have breasts?!!<br />I will no longer be ordering anything of clothing from amazon.<br />it seems that amazon has been bombarded by Chinese companies.<br />do you notice all the fuzzy pics?  that's Chinese manufacturing using another picture.<br />so disappointed."
2.0,Fit poorly despite correct size selection
2.0,The shoe fit as expected and looked great but both zippers broke within a week time. You get what you paid for and sadly the shoes were only worn to a photoshoot and to school twice before they broke.
2.0,"I purchased this for my 9 year old granddaughter. It did not last long, about a week. I would suggest this be used by adults only."
2.0,The strap in the back had to be adjusted constantly.
2.0,"First, the pack is good in quality. But, it was too small and ridged for my purposes. But, because of its &#34;petite&#34; size my 23 year-old daughter latched on to it to use during our family vacation at the beach. It was great for her small makeup items and her ID. I tried to fit my iPhone 6 with a flip open case into the pack. I could shove it in, but getting it out to answer a call was a big challenge. Also, the cellphone crowded out other necessities. My answer was to go to a larger Everest product, I used that during a recent trip to Juneau, ALaska and it was perfect."
2.0,"VERY cheap, flimsy fabric and they feel corse on my skin."
2.0,see through fabric and was larger
2.0,Design of the wallet needs more work. Seems more gimmicky than truly minimalistic. I dont like all of the pull tabs. The leather also makes the wallet thicker than I wouldve liked
2.0,These pants are high waist line jeans. If I had known before I order them I would have never ordered them.
2.0,"I should have ordered a larger size. Also, didn't like the thin feel of the material."
2.0,Cheaply made - not pleased
2.0,the tips crushed in my fingures
2.0,The color faded quickly and the part where the band connect to the watch is loose. Buyer Beware...
2.0,Bad advertisement
2.0,"It's good for a week and I purchased 3 pairs after the first day using it. However, after a week, it is foggy every lap and until now!!! It's very comfortable, but foggyyyyy. But I have to take it out every lap to clear the fog!!!"
2.0,Way too flimsy doesn’t hold up shape I’m pretty sure I’ve shrank down a size
2.0,Nice eye wear
2.0,My wife loves the way it looks but the battery died in the first week.
2.0,"The bandannas are printed on one side only giving a very cheap looking appearance. Not as good as a traditional bandanna I have purchased in the past. General trend of lower quality goods in the market, or so it seems."
2.0,I gave it to my daughter.  I didn't like the material at all. I don't plan to wear it.
2.0,Generally love their clothes line....however...this looked good on line...but much too short in length for me...<br />Quality is good....wish they would have made it longer.....
2.0,These are less durable than sketchers. The front to started coming part after 3 months.
2.0,The watch looks nice but is difficult to read and the light is not very good illumination. I have worn G Shock watches for more than 20 years but they are not as good quality as in the past.
2.0,Sent back...runs way too small
2.0,"Got these EXACT pair off another site (poshmark) but wish I purchased here as they were overpriced--nearly fifty bucks! Like an earlier reviewer posted it is made of VERY CHEAP MATERIAL, the laces start low on thighs and not at hip, and have to be altered by yourself (if you know how to sew) or a professional tailor. The fit is awful and the material used should be illegal--its that bad. It feels like you are wearing a sheet or even paper. SO FREAKING PISSED about this purchase...😠"
2.0,Loses shape after a couple washings..
2.0,"Material feels like dry paint, It was a Christmas sweatshirt. It’s very uncomfortable and feels dry."
2.0,"Constantly featured pieces breaking off and unraveling. My coworkers routinely brough pieces of my backpack to me as it kept falling apart to complete failure in less than a year. I recommend you buy the Carhartt backpack instead, it has provided me with much better results. This thing just didn't hold up for me."
2.0,"Love the design, but the snaps on either side of the Fitbit housing constantly pop off, they do not stay clamped. Very frustrating..."
2.0,These earrings were so difficult to put in.
2.0,It's adorable. If you're only wanting to bake in it or garden then it's fine. I'm a dog groomer and hoped it would be waterproof not just water resistant.
2.0,Very cute and is perfect for dressing up a sleeveless dress or top.  But it runs at least two sizes too small.  I must have gotten in a hurry and skipped the reviews.
2.0,Quality not as good as Custo original from Barcelona.  Print quality disappointing.
2.0,Do not machine wash! As soon as you do it will not be comfortable or be useable.
2.0,This dress looks totally different from the pictures. It's too big and just not so cute.
2.0,It is not just smelling. It is molded! I put it in front of a hair dryer for one hour and still cannot get rid of the smell.<br />Get what? There is condensed water on the id window after blowing with a dryer! Are your warehouse destroyed by a hurricane?
2.0,"Metal started to rust after a few weeks. Cute design, but did not last long without rusting and bending. Mediocre."
2.0,The fabric is very thin almost plastic in texture..
2.0,A lot thinner than I expected. Will probably bend very easily :( also feels a little large compared to my other size 8 rings.
2.0,"On the advice of the other reviewers, I ordered a size larger than I normally do, but it was still way to small"
2.0,These are so cute but they were impossible to get on my little boy’s chubby feet. :(
2.0,Poorly made. Do not waste the money.
2.0,The sizing was very off. I ordered up so that I would make sure it fit me (size 16) and it fit my god child (size 0). The color was nothing like pictures and was actually more of a grey purple not that deep purple shown. The gown had appliques randomly sewn on the skirt which looked rather ugly. The only reason I gave two stars was that they gave me most of my money back instead of trying to ship it back. Now the kids have an ugly dress to wear for Halloween. Would NOT buy again.  Wanted this for my wedding dress but this is not a pretty dress. Looks NOTHING like the image.
2.0,"Sizing is off, it’s uncomfortable"
2.0,Definitely order a size larger unless you like TIGHT polos
2.0,Stones fell out the day I wore it
2.0,"I ordered the size my 4 year old daughter would normally wear after measuring her. This suit was not long enough to cover her nipples. It was a cute suit and seemed to be made well, just totally not the size ordered. Also I ordered a 4/5 and got a small. So the sizes weren't even measured the same as on the site."
2.0,Small fitting and Not what I ordered
2.0,Picture showed red lips  when I bought it
2.0,Thin quality and cheap made
2.0,Size down! I ordered a 3-6 months and it probably would have fit an 18 month old. Adorable outfit but just way too large.
2.0,Thought that the costume came with the white dress as part on the costume. It is only the red part
2.0,"I got it last week and didn't like it. I gave it away, Smell cheap, different Color. :("
2.0,Pretty ring and good price but it rusted after only a week of wear
2.0,"I was very excited about receiving this jacket, and ordered the larger size for post-surgery. However, it was much too small, and I gave it to someone who wears a regular large."
2.0,They look amazing and the polarization is great for blocking the sun. However I only had mine a month or two and one of the screws came out and I lost it. So the side of the frame is useless and can't wear them any more.
2.0,"So this sweater falls victim to the classic plus-size problem of not actually being plus size, they just added length.<br /><br />I own this same sweater pattern in a different fabric in a size L. You can see in the picture, the green ""plus size""  14 is the exact same fit as the size large...it's just several inches longer.<br /><br />After trying it on, the sleeves are small, there is no definition, and it's completely unflattering.<br /><br />If you are a very tall slender woman, this will fit you great. If you are actually a curvaceous shorty, this will make you look like the blob.<br /><br />Aside from the fit, the fabric is very thin. Definitely a summer nights sweater and not a winter sweater."
2.0,Kinda cheaply made and flimsy. Would be fine if it was cheaper.
2.0,I liked the looks of the watch. Trying set the time drove me crazy. The button operation is impossible to fathom with the instructions. My tech grandson finally set the time for me - and even he said it was difficult.
2.0,"I thought there was raised stitching for the colorful pattern, but it is flat, the material is sytnthetic silky and the black lace lace like applique in the crotch and chest area is weird and unappealing (zoom in).  If you look good in khakis with lots of pleats then you've got the figure you need to make this look like something other than a strange housedress.  I bought it for a theme party, but I should have known better.  I'm 5'4 and medium build.  If you were tall and had boyish hips this would look better.  Back it goes!"
2.0,"This is my ONLY item from Thanth that did not work for me but it might just be me. I found it to be an awkward cut for my body. Too snug about the hips and then really blousing about too fast at the torso....just an odd look. The neckline also strangely hit me neither here, nor there. I'm short so maybe one needs to be taller. I'm a great, great lover of Thanth items, so no harm no foul here. I'll still but from Thanth for price and quality, for sure."
2.0,"Do not fit at all!! I ordered my size which is 36...and 36 is what I received but they seemed as though they could have been a small 34 instead. There is no paperwork for me to return the item otherwise I would and maybe re-order a size larger, 38 perhaps because I really like the style of the pants."
2.0,"I gave these two stars because I liked the style (which is why I brought it).  However, it was too tight across the chest and upper arms.  So, I think this top would only work for someone who is smaller up top."
2.0,These are very cute but the ties come off as soon as you try to put it on.<br />Never used them and too late to return.
2.0,I should have read the reviews before purchasing.<br /><br />It is good for layering but isn't a flattering fit and the pattern is printed on giving it a glossy appearance. It will work under a jacket but I doubt I'll be wearing it as much as I thought I would.
2.0,"If I hadn't procrastinated, this would've gone back. The style and the fit was great, but the seam is in the front and the polka dots are not even close to matching..."
2.0,The item ripped on the third business card I put in.  Very disappointing.
2.0,"Cute sweatshirt-however the neckline is so wide there is no way to make this stay on. Unlike the picture, it looks unfinished."
2.0,The material is a thick polyester that has more of a dingy gray tint to it.  Makes it look like it got washed with black clothing. Gross. Far from white.
2.0,"The material is very thin and clingy.  It looked like it would snag easily, so I am returning it.  Also, the design is screened on and sticks together, so in order for the sleeve to hang properly, I had to pull apart where the design was sticking together. .I read that some people wore it as a cover up, which I guess would work, but if you are looking for a dress to wear in a professional setting, I wouldn't select this one."
2.0,"Would be cute if it wasn't so big. I'm 5'2&#34; 115 lbs ordered a small and its huge, wish they had an x small"
2.0,too tight in the arms and waist
2.0,I washed it once it came in and it immediately faded. The top is huge for a medium. My mother who is a XL tried it on and it fit her perfectly. It's the after one wash making it look like it's been washed for months that is the bother.
2.0,For me they fit just fine but with the 87 nylon in the 13 spandex is combination of fabrics that is a little irritating to me. But within about 20 minutes after that they’re not bad.<br /><br /> Edit: these pants are bad. I cannot wear them. they irritate way too much for me.  Also they are made for a taller person than I am and so they keep punching up around my ankles and trying to fall down.
2.0,"stiff cheap leather... you get what you pay for, should've known better, and it is not reversible."
2.0,It looks weird and it’s so small for a kids face
2.0,Run large The color is beautiful and these are statement piece glasses.
2.0,Merry Christmas! I wanted to ask how do I change a pair of pants to buy but the medium size is very small
2.0,"I'm giving these two stars because I'll wear them, but they're not the go-to I had hoped they'd be. Arch support is minimal to non-existent. I'll be adding insoles to them soon and there's plenty of room for them. They came smelling STRONGLY of chemicals and required an overnight outside airing. The leather is plastic-fake looking and despite ads, are NOT warm at all. Again, they're big, so plenty of room for thicker socks.  I think this purchase may have finally broken me of the habit of believing that things actually look like they're pictured and are actually a good deal for the price. Not worth the ""sale"" price -- or the month+ wait for delivery."
2.0,"I bought this suit in July 2017 and have only worn it about 3x since then. Unfortunately, the metallic print has started &#34;peeling&#34; away from the fabric and it looks just awful. There are also parts of the fabric that are losing their green color. I always rinse out the suit after use, BTW. While I really liked the suit when I first purchased it (and it's quite flattering on), for the amount I paid, this suit was a complete waste of money if you can only get 3 wearings out of it."
2.0,The picture made it seem like it was a wallet but its just two pieces of carbon fiber (one front and one back) that is holding the cards in between by a rubber band that looks like the old school &#34;live strong&#34; bracelets.<br />I hate to leave a bad review but this either needs better description or else good luck.
2.0,Small and crappy quality.
2.0,"You get what you pay for.  Slit is in the back with a zipper, not the front/side as advertised  Material is very cheap as is the zipper.  Won't buy from this company again.  Fast delivery considered."
2.0,Cute but came used / dirty. Amazon was unable to help because I was on a time line for when I needed to use it.
2.0,The material was more coarse than I had hoped for. It is like a stretchy broadcloth.
2.0,This is a cute dress! The material is pretty clingy and thin :(
2.0,"I tried to order this ring, however this company's offering does not appear to even allow  a customer to order a specific size.  Too bad--it looks like a nice ring."
2.0,NOT UPF as described!  No UPF listed on shirt label or packaging when it arrives.  Misleading!
2.0,"The sizing worked out fine but I feel the boots are cheaply made. I have worn them 4 times & I already lost one of the studs & scuffed the toe on one boot. Where the scuff is, it is just white and is really noticeable. I'm disappointed I spent a good amount of money on cheaply made shoes."
2.0,"I was planning on dying these for a costume I was making. I have a lot of experience dying fabric, but no matter what I did to these it wouldn't take. That may not be fault of the producers, but it didn't fit my personal needs."
2.0,Doesn’t light up but still cute
2.0,The sweater is cozy and oversized - I usually wear a medium and I could have sized down. I ordered the solid lavender color and it isn't at all like the picture. The color is very dull and muted. Not at all the color I needed.
2.0,Straps are very short... Also this is more purple than silver
2.0,"So sad to have to give this a bad review. This purse is so cute (I got lots of compliments). It's the perfect size - small enough to not be in the way but big enough that you can fill it up if you need. I like that it's not hard and make of vinyl, so it's water resistant and doesn't stain or anything. The downside is that I could tell from day 1 that the quality might not be there.. and I was right. One of the write straps broke beyond repair. Had to throw it out. So sad! I'm now looking for a better quality purse that is similar in function and appearance."
2.0,I ordered the yellow I received the blue one. The lining only goes to the waist the rest is just chiffon no lining all the way to the floor. I didn't like that style I didn't want my legs to show. So I didn't reorder.
2.0,This does not look like real leather and the quality of the interior structure is bumpy. I do like the width and length and the gold tone attachments. I don't use it.
2.0,The rubber bands that  supposed to tighten the string that holds the glasses loosen up and u lose your glasses! I lost 1 pair of sunglasses and a pair of bi-focals while on vacation
2.0,"I didn’t like the material, it was thick but felt like cheap polyester. Aside from that I looked frumpy in it. It hugged my curves in all the wrong places and the buttons for the straps were in the back instead of the front like a classic overall. If felt wrong."
2.0,NOT HAPPY WITH THIS PURCHASE AT ALL! I wear a large so I bought a 2x. Fits like a medium. Very thin material. Cheaply made!
2.0,Very thin and wrinkled!
2.0,I would like that the largest stone had all its smaller stones 3 were missing
2.0,Broke very fast
2.0,The pants were a bit tight for me. The main concern I had was the style. The zippers are just for show...they don't actually open up into holes at the top.  I ended up returning them for the size and style issues.
2.0,"Length of string is too short, coin is a bit small."
2.0,"looked decent online, when it arrived i was extremely disappointed with the quality. its a light spring sweater, no where near decent for winter"
2.0,Didn't love them or hate them to straight fitting for me
2.0,"Item wasn't the same color as the one pictured, it's a lighter color blue. It is very tight on my head however I  gave it two stars because the design is super cool."
2.0,The color is not as described. More like a very light mint green. Still 2 stars because it’s a very nice thick material. Would order again in another color if the color is guaranteed.
2.0,Case and interior came separated from each other. I was in a pinch so I had to glue it and clamp it until I could replace it.
2.0,"I am really disappointed in Fitbit.  The tracker works fine,  The website is OK (I still have no ability to sync with my Kindle), but the bands are crap.  The orignial that came with the unit was hard to put on and eventually tore (about 6 months after I received it).  I ordered this replacement.  It was much easier to put on, but now the band is separating from the portion that holds the tracker.  I feel that I should not have to replace it every 6 months.  Fitbit does not have a place on their website for feedback, so my guess is that they do not want to hear from customers.  $100 is not too much if it performs, but the band issue means it does not perform. Bummer!"
2.0,disappointed. Gave them to my wife. very small!
2.0,Very cute. But too small. They run really small
2.0,It was not what I expected.  I love Sak handbags. This one is not soft leather like my others. And I didn’t expect it to be only a inch thick. Not big enough for a wallet and phone and lipstick.  I love the small size. However it’s not the same soft leather. Very stiff.
2.0,"I was hooked on the teddy coat trend and I wasn’t so excited to try this one out. Unfortunately couple thing didn’t work out for me.<br />1. Picture showed it has fur inside, but it’s only around the edges. Inside is still just liners which not as comfy as full fur liner.<br />2. The color is a true teddy bear orange brown unlike the picture which is more muted beige brown. It looks like I skinned 15 teddy bears to make this one jacket.<br />3. The fit is too big and not flattering. I’m usually a small in everything, but this small fits like a xl for me which surprising considering it’s probably an Asian sizing. It looks like I am 30lbs bigger vs oversize. I literally look like a human version of TED the movie bear in this true teddy bear color jacket.<br />It’s still a soft and medium jacket that’s comfy, but for the color I chose and the cut I wasn’t;t a fan."
2.0,"I'm glad I listened to the other reviews here and ordered TWO sizes up because this underwear is either in tiny Asian sizes or children's sizes.<br /><br />I'm 5'4"" and 112 lbs. I usually wear a Medium in underwear. I ordered these in an X-Large, and they fit fine. They were huge when I took them out of the packaging, but they definitely shrunk two sizes after washing them.<br /><br />Overall, while these are perfectly serviceable underwear that gets the job done, I'm not loving them. The fabric is a little stiff, and they sit a bit lower than I like on the hips. Honestly, it feels like I'm an adult wearing children's underwear, and I don't like that.<br /><br />So if you do decide to order these, keep in mind the sizing is WAY off, and you may want to order one, even two sizes up."
2.0,"I LIKED THE WAIST FIT, BUT THE RISE FROM THE BOTTOM OF THE CROTCH TO THE TOP OF THE PANTS, THERE IS TOO MUCH MATERIAL. I HAVE TO PULL THEM UP PAST MY BELLY BUTTON TOO WALK COMFORTABLE."
2.0,"The jacket itself looks good and seem like it's good quality. All my jackets are medium size. It says order a size up or 2, so I went with 2 sizes up which is XL and way to small. 3XL would probably be the one to fit me well."
2.0,A few chains already broke
2.0,Dress is not made for a curved woman. More fore a woman with no chest & no butt. Terrible doesn't look anything like the pictures. I wasted money.
2.0,"Since the reviews said it runs small, I ordered a size up.  Got a medium.  It’s too big and boxy, so the shape is not flattering.  This item did not run small in my opinion.  I may return it for the smaller size (is it worth the hassle?), but otherwise I can’t wear it."
2.0,"Shirt quality and fit ok, however, way off on color shown versus actual color received.  It’s a bright hot pink!"
2.0,No chain!
2.0,Much too small and definitely too narrow!
2.0,"We had to return two pairs that we ordered for our preschoolers.  The curve to the inside of the ear muff is a bit excessive, therefore preventing it from laying entirely flat on their ears.  It is not incredibly cold here so laying flat is not a deal breaker.  If you are looking for child's ear muffs for frigid weather, these are not them.<br /><br />They are well-stitched, cute and fuzzy.<br /><br />Two stars because the wire frame on both pairs was irreversibly bent.  One pair the U-shaped band had a sharp bend in it above an ear, meaning the ear muff met his ear at an angle that was not providing warmth to the bottom half of his ear.  The other pair, one ear muff was twisted and pushed forward, so while one muff was on his ear, the messed up one was resting sideways on his cheek.<br /><br />The first two photos show the twisted pair from both sides.  The third photo shows the bend in the head band."
2.0,it fits but the leg showing doesn't really happen.. its just a regular maxi dress and you can pull the one shoulder to the side. the leg slit isn't that high though so its misleading
2.0,NOT squat proof! But very flattering. Might be safe to wear for upper body days.
2.0,"Of course these shirts are cotton and it shrinks, but when they do they wont work for anyone over 4'1&#34;.  The v neck plunges like a blouse.  These would be a great fit if you are really short and really round.  The fabric feels good and the amount you get for your money is phenomenal."
2.0,The band is kind of an old lady grey color and not the silvery color in the picture
2.0,Love the top of this swimsuit but the bottoms are not what they show. I took a chance on this after reading reviews because some people did get the right bottoms and others didn't. I am sad to say I got the ones that look like giant granny panties so I will not be wearing this ever.
2.0,"Unfortunately, the front lock to keep the purse shut only worked for a day before it would not keep shut anymore. I wrapped a rubber band around it to add friction so it could stay closed, but it ended up not mattering, as the hardware for the shoulder strap broke a day later, and then a week after that, the handle on the top broke off so I couldn't use it at all."
2.0,"WASTE OF MONEY, bought it for the closet as a &#34;Just in case dress. The dress has stretch, but has a weird fit on my DD's. The print is horrible looks more the dye that went wrong. SMH, dont WASTE time or money. Thinking about returning this junk!"
2.0,picture and product were different.  Returned it. Looked like pajama's.
2.0,"I bought these glasses for my wife for mountain biking and they were not the quality I expected. Maybe I hoped for too much out of such a low cost product. Cons: plastic nose rest, hard and uncomfortable. Fog easy with activity. Pros: does add more light during dusk hours. Better suited for construction work than sporting wear."
2.0,"I was so excited to get this bag.  I love the size, the color and the fact that the straps are not made of the quilted fabric because that is the first place that Vera bags show wear.  Anyway as soon as I took it out of the package I noticed that the fabric is not as stiff as other bags and it would not easily stand up on it’s own but the real disappointment is that the zipper broke within the first week of use.  I can fix it but it will break again soon after and I do not overload my bags.  Surely for $130 Vera Bradley could make a better product!"
2.0,Two holes in the seam. One was rather large the other about 2.5 in.
2.0,"Very cheeply made , and sent the purple not the blue 😡"
2.0,"They’re definitely nice earrings. I thought they were a regular stud, not threaded studs you had to screw together. (Lol- screws.) Because of this they are much thicker, so they don’t fit in my piercings."
2.0,"Great material. So soft, runs really small in the arms, so it was returned"
2.0,The tooth was great but the tooth fairy costume is very cheap looking.
2.0,It was much shorter than I expected.  Had to return it.
2.0,"It's spandex silk material. Stand in place, adjust and it looks sexy...take a step an all hell breaks loose it's up your neck in your butt like floss an you'll have cameltoe for days but if that's your look then you are about to buy the right outfit. Otherwise it does look just like the pic an is very cute."
2.0,"We purchased this for a homecoming dance.  Not sure if it was our error or the way the item was described, but we were not expecting a clip on tie ... and that is what this is.  It would be fine for a younger boy, but not for a semi-formal high school dance.  We gave it away to a friend with dress-up trunk."
2.0,"looks cheap, get what you pay for, much shorter than picture"
2.0,"The backs kept falling off, i was disappointed."
2.0,The bottoms were way too flared out for my liking. It was like high water bell bottoms. Not for me.
2.0,"The material of these are very thick, the picture was great but they are awful to wear. my kids were so happy when they opened these and soon became very disappointed. They don't fit, i ordered kids sizes and they were much too small. They are so thick you can't breath or talk in them, so they have become just another failed mask hanging with the rest."
2.0,The fabric is very nice but there is no fitting in these. Just straight. Doesn’t hug at all
2.0,"I thought that they would look more like the picture, but they do not. The earrings honestly look weird."
2.0,"Polished great, but from first use it began fraying on the edges."
2.0,"Look great until you wash them. Super bummed they get little balls when you wash them. Also had to fix two straps when they came, not a big deal just kinda annoying"
2.0,"The color was not the shown blueish teal, it was a goldish brown. The design pattern was smaller and slightly different. I appreciate that it was handmade, but the corners were already beginning to fray. Don't over pay for this you can find much nicer ones for a slightly better price on amazon or at any department store. I got it as a gift for my mother-in-aw but was so disappointed when i received it that I gave it to my niece to use when she plays &#34;dress up&#34; and she loved it. That is the only reason it got 2 stars instead of 1."
2.0,"I purchased this item back in July and started using it right away.  Within the first 24 hours the latch broke while still in my back pocket.  I reached out to the manufacturer and the quickly replaced it.  Well, it has happened again, became unlatched in back pocket and heard a snap when I went to get out of chair.  The product seems nice, but the latch is not staying closed causing it to break."
2.0,These are supposed to be compression type shirts but what I received was something that resembled a regular tank top. They don’t compress at all and the threads were coming undone right out of the package. The fit is larger than what I ordered and as for customer service...forget it. Do yourself a favor an stray away from these.
2.0,The fabric did not suit me. It’s nylon which makes it too sweaty in warm weather.
2.0,Not oversized and ran a bit on the small side. Wearable but not what was described.
2.0,When injured can’t snap with one hand nor want another to press against body.  Love the material and big size.  Expensive so would just order a plain extra big black shirt.  And longer so don’t need to wear shorts.
2.0,Did not really care for the way it looked  on.
2.0,"Cheap material that will show wear quickly. The one with the big engines is probably a true 2T, but the other with the smaller pictures all over is way too small. Feet are very small in both sets. They are soft and my boys love them because they are Thomas-related, but they are not worth the price."
2.0,It fits pretty snug even though I ordered up a size. The fabric isnt as nice as comparable dresses I have ordered.
2.0,Very long and very thin
2.0,I only regret not buying the black trim instead of silver. But these are ok. I wanted better than ok LoL
2.0,The style of the outfit is great! If the material  was thicker I would keep it. I will be returning this outfit. The quality of the outfit is very thin and super cheap. At best this is a $10 outfit.  The material is transparent and very clingy. Every lump and bump and color of underwear will be seen in this outfit.
2.0,"Wrong Size, Wrong Color"
2.0,Hope this note gets to the manufacturer.  Loved this dress to order for an end of the summer vacation. Finally wore it for the first time tonight and the strap broke. The plastic ring on the back strap just popped off. Would love to replace the dress and try again but I may have missed the return window.  Please help.
2.0,Weird fitting...
2.0,"I had a bad reaction in my ear wearing this one. Now it looks rusty! Can’t say if it is rust, though I’ve never had a silver earring do this before."
2.0,Ran super small and couldn’t handle the itchy sequins.
2.0,"I'm 4'11&#34; and the small was way too small. The gap in the front was too far apart as well, so a larger size would not have worked for me. Pretty and good material, though!"
2.0,Corriente
2.0,"Not something I would put in my nose since it's twisty and stuff. Have this in my cartilage, and although it's cute, the shape of it pushes against the shell of my ear and I'm having a hard time sleeping on the side where the piercing is. Great for the price though."
2.0,In the process of returning the item.
2.0,There is no way to loosen or tighten straps
2.0,Super thin fabric so it doesn’t do much to hold the stomach in and too short if you have long legs. I love the print though.
2.0,This ok outfit is adorable. The shirt is very thin and it run true to size but the bottom is extremely small.
2.0,Way to small... I bought xl and looks like a small...
2.0,"Necklace looks cute and lays well, but the very first time I wore it I lost two stones the very first day. Pieces of the necklace randomly fell off while I was sitting. Based on this type of construction it appears the necklace is only meant to be worn a couple times for the life of the product. Buyer beware."
2.0,These leggings are exactly how they are pictured and very very warm! However the sizing is absolutely wrong I'm a medium in everything but the medium I bought fit like an exstra small so size up
2.0,After application and wearing birks two o three times it comes off by peeling off gradually
2.0,"Ugh. Was so pretty but within a week, two stones fell out. Very disappointed. I never wore it when washing my hands or showering so it's very disappointing that it couldn't even last through a basic day of being worn."
2.0,Nice looking scarf but it feels rough.  The description is wrong claiming to be cotton- linen.  This happens every time I buy a clothing item on Amazon that is made in China.  In case you don't know the acid test for a fabric is to take a small piece and burn it.  Cotton and linen turn to a fine powdered ash. But this scarf just melted into hard plastic which means it is synthetic.
2.0,"Frankly, an ugly ring. Pictured, it looked wider horizontally and much more feminine. The pearl is nice but the setting looks masculine."
2.0,La calidad es media
2.0,I'm 5'9&#34; and the waist hit wayyy too high on me which was terribly unflattering and made me look somewhat pregnant honestly. Otherwise the dress was comfortable and seemed to be high enough quality considering the price. Might work well for someone a bit shorter!
2.0,okay to be worn under dress but not the type of leggings you wear without pants. hate the waist line. waist is saggy while calves are tight. if you're more leg heavy small torso these are not for you.
2.0,"A very heavy garment, way to large and uncomfortable."
2.0,"Itched my ears, so not so good!"
2.0,It's truly a beautiful bracelet. Just unsure as to how to assemble. It came in two pieces. Unable to wear it.
2.0,This has a smell that won't go away!
2.0,"Fits great. 5’8- 150 pounds - size medium. However, the material that was scrunched was scrunched weird and it looked like I had a hole in my pants and looked really bad. Loved them but had to return."
2.0,"They are not as high waisted as the picture, and fit a little smaller than expected."
2.0,"La falda está bonita, pero la talla aunque era L, parecía una 2XL"
2.0,This was described as boys sunglasses.  They are actually very small.  I would imagine for infants and very young toddlers.  I gave them away.  It's not the money really but the description.
2.0,Slim fitted but nice design. A little too sheer for my taste
2.0,My son loves the watch but it arrived with scratches all over the glass.
2.0,This thing is not even Pitt blue. It's kinda purple with dark horizontal lines running through it all over like the ink was low. The writing looks fuzzy. This failed diy project is being returned.
2.0,Way heavy. So bummed because I love the color and detail! Returning them. :(
2.0,I'm a petite woman with a 36C chest. This is a super cute style of dress but ended up being more of an empire style which is unflattering style for me.
2.0,To hard to shut.
2.0,"Bought this specifically to clean silver jewelry with opals  ... & was very disappointed to see that the instruction note that comes with the cloth says not to use it for that purpose.  It may work ok, but was not what I bought it for.  Very disappointed."
2.0,"Just a word to the wise: If you're only going to paint rocks once, these will be fine I guess. However, I bought a 20 pound bag of nice white rocks for painting at Lowe's for $10.48. Just saying....."
2.0,"File this under you get what you pay for.  I buy a lot of workout clothes on Amazon, and I found these on a &#34;you might also like&#34; link.  In fact, there is not much to like here.  Odd, awkward fit, even for volley shorts, with a bulge in material by the crotch.  Extremely thin material on the shorts, cheap mesh, you would not want to wear these playing any active sports.  Dated styling, with the piping on the sides, look just like shorts from the mid-1970s, but not in a cool retro way.  For a few dollars more you can get much higher quality shorts elsewhere."
2.0,Good quality. Fabric is nice and thick. But the shirt is wayyy too small. I ordered a size bigger than usual assuming this shirt would be a little snug. But even ordering up a size was not sufficient! The built in bra is nice but the pads over the breasts are tan colored and very visible through the white fabric! But this isn’t a big deal because they can easily be removed.
2.0,"Doesn’t go all the way to the floor, and I’m only 5’2”. Very narrow, basically covers the back and shoulders, not the front. Color and fabric are nice, would have been awesome if they had been a bit more generous in the dimensions"
2.0,Fit nicely on my top half... but the bottom half was too tight.
2.0,I never leave bad reviews unless I have too. The material is like a men’s ribbed tank top but thinner.
2.0,Beautiful . but broke in 15 minutes. Didnt even get to take a picture. Very dissapointed. 2 stars for the simple fact that it was gorgeous while it was intact 😑😑
2.0,This choker was huge. Definitely for someone with a longer neck.
2.0,Shrunk in the wash. So what fit well is now somewhat small
2.0,"Pretty, but super thick, and inner lining loose so sucks in and out while talking. Not to comfy"
2.0,"Much shorter than portrayed in photo.  Not even close to that length.  Also, the material is thin as tissue paper."
2.0,I didn’t like them to well. They never stayed on my ear properly.
2.0,This dress is not full length as if expected
2.0,"Cheap design, size runs small. The graphic on front will bend and crack."
2.0,Disliked the materiel and weight. Arms too long as was the lenght.
2.0,This bag is nice. Good fabric storage space is big and it compacts but it doesn't hold shape so things get lost easy inside.
2.0,Feels very cheap.
2.0,Not good quality.  The button fell off on the first wear.
2.0,I bought this for my 5 foot 1 inch 107 pound itty bitty wife. Even though we selected the appropriate size the top fit like a dress it was so big she was swimming in it.  Apparently unless you are a taller woman you are going to have the same issue.
2.0,"Thought it was beautiful, put it on, a week later it wears thin and broke. The hemp they used must have been cheap, or not hemp at all. Very disappointed."
2.0,"Wanted to like it, but returned it. It was too small for my needs. Did not like how it expanded, once I put my cards in it."
2.0,"Looks like good shirts.  I won't know how well they wear for a little while.  I bought them for cooler weather. AND THEN, I  started wearing the shirt.  I ordered an xlg.  The shirt is plenty large; BUT, the horizontal reflective tape is smaller effectively leaving the shirt a size too small.  I would not recommend this product."
2.0,"Review of cotton robe on a 5'3&#34; woman who normally wears a size 12.<br />Pros:<br />-The fabric is soft and is a mid-weight cotton. Perfect because I don't want a big fluffy robe to overheat inn while drying my hair, etc.<br />-The sleeves are slim, not big and flowy.<br />-There are side pockets.<br />-Hits me at the knee.<br />-Has some stretch.<br /><br />Cons:<br />-Ordered medium based on the cotton robe sizing.<br />-Too small & shrunk in the dryer (on low).<br />-Gapes open in the front.<br />-The front edges do not lie flat, like someone forgot to stitch the inside. The pink corded edge is more like piping down the middle of the navy fabric. I don't even know if ironing would help.<br />-Pockets on side seams are small & do not lie flat.<br /><br />Definitely size up. Perhaps the seller could retake the size measurements so they would be more accurate. Not pleased. :("
2.0,I have big arms it’s just don’t work for me.
2.0,Pretty but not the right size.
2.0,"It looked really cute online, but not so much in person. The material was not what I expected and it was much shorter than I thought it would be. I expected it to cover my butt but really it just went to my waist. A larger size would have been too big everywhere else."
2.0,The material is very clingy and not flowy like the pictures would make you think. The sleeves were way too tight as well. Did not look flattering. The only good thing was the color
2.0,"Worn maybe 10 times, and already the butt of the pants are torn near the back pocket.  Unfortunately poor quality pants."
2.0,"My daughter loves this and was really excited when she got. After only a few times of wearing it though I noticed the hood was starting to unravel, and the sleeve completely came apart."
2.0,"The arms are tight, but the body portion of the shirt is very loose and has no shape. The shirt over all is comfortable, but not something I would wear out of the house"
2.0,The shirt had a two inch hole in the seam! My wife had to repair it. Bad quality control!
2.0,Poor quality fell apart after first use
2.0,"Honestly the material is very thick. You definitely cannot see through them. But it is so thick that it's not as breathable and comfortable as other yoga pants that I own. I sweat more in them during workouts. They are also not soft to the touch, more harsh. The length is great though. But it makes me look like I have a saggy butt though, it does not cup the buttocks like all my other yoga pants. It is tight across the mid-buttock but then the fabric is just flabby underneath it. I find it a little uncomfortable. I have had these for at least 6 months now and washing them has softened them some but the fit has never changed. I would not buy again, but they are not horrible. I still wear them cause the price was right as they are not so bad that I wanted to throw them out. I hate returning things, but I probably should have returned these and tried a different brand."
2.0,Not a good value.  The material is really thin.
2.0,Print is croaked
2.0,Fits like a tunic dress. Not a tee.
2.0,"Product is very weird looking in person. Fit my head funny and look very cheap in person. Good price, but not worth it in my opinion!"
2.0,"These fit ok, HOWEVER, they are not high waisted. I’m 5ft 3in and they barley went above my belly button. The top kept rolling down and they ride up in the most uncomfortable/ unflattering ways possible. Wish they have worked because they fit perfect for length which is hard to find for me."
2.0,Item as described but a little on the cheap side manufacturing. Not as pretty as the picture
2.0,They are cute but very cheaply made.  The sole is a little thicker than cardboard. The run about 1/2 size small.
2.0,I expect sterling and dainty. They look like they are spare parts from a mechanics tool kit.  The post is also bent.
2.0,"You can't beat the price but if you are buying this for a watch you are going to wear every day, you may want to reconsider. It itches, and after about a week and a half I had a rash underneath the band."
2.0,"Very thin and flimsy, not as oversized and comfortable as I’d hoped. Pretty disappointed with this product for sure"
2.0,"Gorgeous ring...and it’s huge, which I ended up liking. Poorly made, unfortunately. After 1 week the entire stone came out. Very disappointing"
2.0,I love the case however it fell apart rather quickly. In about 3 months the cards were able to fall through the bottom and all the corners had peeled up. Once again it is a great case but there is no longevity.
2.0,Have to fold in half to use because it is almost as long as my arm. This causes it to slip and not cover your nose. I have a long thin neck and head is size 7 for comparison.
2.0,Lol a week
2.0,"This dress resembles a costume dress one would buy from a costume party store. The quality is pretty cheap.  Static to the touch and not comfortable to wear (a bit itchy). I was expecting a dress of &quot;good quality&quot; similar to that of forever 21 (since the price is comparable). However, that wasn't the case and I relied on the comments left by others...opps! Good for costume parties, but not date night cute. I will be returning this dress .<br /><br />However, it fit as expected. I am 5'6 and 126 lbs- and the small fit well."
2.0,WAS NOT QUITE WHAT I HAD IN MIND.
2.0,"I would love to rate these higher, they’re gorgeous, they fit great, but they broke the second day I had them in. I tried multiple ones and they were all like that. :/"
2.0,"I was dissapointed, of the 5 hats we ordered, two were crushed irreparably.  The other 3 served their purpose and was fine for the price.<br />Shipper should have more care when they pack the box."
2.0,"I have a larger chest so I was looking for a high-necked bathing suit (they are hard to find!) This one was super cute, but when I got it, it barely stretches so I couldn't even get it on. When I tried to stretch it, it made cranking noises like all the stitching was coming apart and the bottoms were super small."
2.0,"Sizing was not accurate.  Was much larger than usual.  Fabric quality was not great.  Was expecting better.  If you don't golf that much I don't think it is a big deal.  But if you are an avid golfer, just go with a good brand name and spend the extra money."
2.0,"Very pretty, but broke after second time I wore it."
2.0,"I went by the photo of the model wearing the earrings instead of the photo with the measurements (bad move on my part), and was disappointed that they are so tiny. They’re impossible to clasp. Maybe if they were larger they’d be easier to clasp. They’re cute, though."
2.0,I didn’t like the color.
2.0,"I love the hat.  Very nice green.  Hat is well made.  I don't love the shield.  The fit on the was better than I expected.  Very flimsy grade vinyl. A positive is that the shield wraps more around the head and goes further down under the chin compared to ""theshield"".  This item, the jeff & amy cadet hat with shield - I found that it distorts vision really bad.  I was surprised how it distorted my view when moving.  Almost to the point of vertigo.  Will try to use it in the winter as it is way to hot to use now.  Purchased the shield like professional health workers wear and it's much better to see out of vision wise.  Still hot, but it's not as stifling as this vinyl shield hat combo."
2.0,"Not what I was expecting at all.  It's very cheap, almost like a child's toy.  It looks A LOT better in the photos that they uploaded.  I wish I had not wasted my money on it."
2.0,Pretty bummed. Went to use it tonight for the love fantasy football draft we held at our house only to find out we had a duplicate sheet of running back players and never got A-G. Had to hand write all 30 players- wasn’t please :( but oh well.
2.0,The measurement was too small for what it said
2.0,I expected the legging to be thick but it was too thin. And it’s quite big for me.
2.0,Liked them but way too small. Might order a larger size.
2.0,I ordered an xl in OFF WHITE. The shirt is NOT OFF WHITE---It Is Light GREY-----Big difference form OFF WHITE !!!!!!! It is Marked Off White on the package---A Blind person could tell the difference !
2.0,The material looked really cheap. And it ran small.
2.0,"Leggings are soft and comfortable, however after one wash the seam started to unravel."
2.0,Cheap designs they put the picture as you download it they don’t take the background for the picture
2.0,Wouldn’t suggest buying. Very tight in thighs
2.0,"for the money, ok. but just too cheap."
2.0,"If you are pregnant, you will not look like this model, you will look like a beached whale wearing a clown costume. The eneven hemline (not shown in picturejust) accentuates your size.<br /><br />I decided not to return it because it may come in handy during the blazing hot summer when I'm closer to full term, but it's pretty ridiculous now.<br /><br />A belt helps, and the pockets are amazing--all dresses should have one."
2.0,Falling apart I haven't worn it yet the stap is ripping off..I'm unsure how that is possible.a bit see through and seams seem torn
2.0,"I’m size 145 about 5’4 in height… I got the black one in Large, because that’s the size I wear … I love it it’s pretty and silky, But wow it’s HUGE, I’m not super tiny, so I wanted an oversized look but this is basically past my knees… it doesn’t look sexy or cute at all which was the look I was trying to go for  I probably should’ve gotten a small… but it’s fine I will wear it as a nightgown"
2.0,Definitely not a 50 L !
2.0,I got this as a quick birthday gift for someone and I wasn't impressed with the way it looked.
2.0,Was so happy when the outfit arrived but after opening it one of the straps was frayed and was not happy with the sizing my daughter is extremely petite and the outfit fit her too small and too tight and that was shocking seeing as how she is a size XS6 and the size I ordered was a 7T according to the seller I hope this helps when others buy this item. I would have returned the item however the seller did not put any return labels and I was not going to waste more money to return the product.  However on the up side the print on the outfit is super adorable.
2.0,Run way big. Had to return. Don't like the way the neck fits.
2.0,Didnt hold well
2.0,not lined
2.0,"These did not fit attractively on me. I love linen, but these seemed even worse about wrinkling. They made me look larger than I am."
2.0,Does not fit like the photo shows.
2.0,Fit well.  After a few weeks the magnet wasn't as strong and started slipping around.  Broke tiny chain and caused it to be sharp.  Even filing rough part down did not help
2.0,"this necklace is cute when you look at the pictures, however in person it’s extremely flimsy and feels really cheap. it also gets tangled every time you move. very disappointed the description was misleading."
2.0,Way too small. If you are going to buy go a size up.
2.0,The band is pretty and exactly what I was hoping for appearance wise. Unfortunately the attachment point to the watch is not as secure as the factory band causing it to pop loose any time I bump my watch on something. Ultimately I could not keep it on for fear of dropping my versa 2 and breaking it.
2.0,"Not as pictured. The picture showed a solid back with lace trim at the bottom, the actual shirt has the similar lace insets at the bodice in the back as they are at the front. Not a deal breaker, but not what I ordered. Also, the material is very chintzy. I also order up a size due to reviews, and that wasn't necessary, now the shirt is a bit larger than i need. Therefore I would recommend purchasing true to size."
2.0,Fits perfect but the material is super thin and a bit flimsy.
2.0,"Does not keep sweat out of your eyes!!!! Period!!! You can buy to keep sun off your face. I wasted one time, not impressed. Not quick drying takes minimum of overnight and it get a little dirty so you have to wash it somehow"
2.0,a bit disappointed when i saw the actual earring
2.0,"I like the shoes in theory but I realize now that a unisex shoe cannot possibly fit true to size. An 8.5 (women's) should have worked but it was too short so I reordered a size 9 which even then was iffy but I have a narrow foot so going up in size made the shoe wider so had to tighten the laces quite a bit which made them less comfortable and silly looking on my feet so all in all, they just don't fit great. Will try a ladies shoe next."
2.0,Material is extremely see through.  Not worth the money
2.0,It fit really nice but the color is dull it’s not as bright as in the picture.
2.0,Thank you for accepting return of item. It was damp and had a stain when I took it out of box.
2.0,It has a droopy wear to the skirted area.  Very disappointing.
2.0,"Sweater vest looks super cute in picture, however is not so comfortable in person. The fabric is a little itchy and the neckline is snug. Definitely need some thing underneath for the neckline to be comfortable. Still debating on returning this."
2.0,Seems like a nice tactical backpack. Unfortunately I was mislead by the description of what they say you get. I did not receive the five free carabiners or the extra pouch. There are also a lot of stitching flaws throughout. You definitely pay for what you get. Will be returning and getting a different one for sure.
2.0,I like the design of the piece but the quality could be better as I lost a stone out of the piece and it ruined a blouse of mine as the prongs that holds the stones snagged the material of my top
2.0,"I got the L/XL hat and it was way too small for my big, fat, bald dome."
2.0,"The picture for this shirt is misleading. There is nothing 3D about this shirt in real life, especially not when you wear it. The shirt is soft to the touch but it's not very breathable material and you get hot fast. My 6 year old son is happy with it but I wouldn't buy it again."
2.0,"These look great, no complaints about that. However, for some reason they made them with no extra room in the chain, on the clasp side—it’s right against the choker. Never had a piece of jewelry like that. The widest choker is extremely difficult to maneuver, it’s stupid, especially if you have acrylic nails-don’t even bother buying unless there is someone around to take it on and off for you LOL."
2.0,"Ladies....it's fully transparent. What's more, is the bust area is made for someone who has pretty betties like the model in the photo. If youre lacking in that area like I am....beware of the sag and gape."
2.0,"Feeling very let down on this purchase.<br /><br />This was the 2nd case that I have purchased from these folks.<br /><br />Previous History: The first purchase I ever made from them was for a set of their readers. I gave them a 5 star review praising them.<br /><br />The second purchase was for another set of their readers in case they ever went out of business. That's how much I liked their product! Their readers are definitely the best I have ever purchased in over 25 years of using them. I just told my wife a couple of days ago that I'll probably need more powerful lenses before these glasses die.<br /><br />After receiving the first set of readers, I ordered a case to protect them. The case (1st time ordering one) was absolutely perfect in fit and finish, literally. I was once again very impressed by their workmanship and quality control. Another 5 star review from me.<br /><br />Then I received the second case that I ordered a few days ago. I had really thought that this outfit was the epitome of quality construction before I received this case.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the top and bottom pieces don’t seat properly. This should have certainly been noticed before it was sent out the door.<br /><br />I played with it for a while and it looks better. However, since I was squeezing it and forcing it out of its initial fit, I’m sure it won’t stay this way forever.<br /><br />I was very disappointed in this particular item. I see that it is reverting back to its previous fit after only 24 hours or so. Since it looks somewhat better now (temporarily) I can’t be bothered returning it. I just feel let down.<br /><br />I will still order readers from them when the time comes, but only one set at a time.<br /><br />P.S. I HAD to select &#34;Fit as expected&#34; since the top and bottom are the correct sizes, they just don't fit together."
2.0,"I was going to return them because they keep switching of, but the kiddos decided it was ok and they do not wanted to wait for the replacement."
2.0,Cool glasses but the lenses were damaged making the glasses unwearable
2.0,Product fit large and long.
2.0,Cheaply make and looks like it is.
2.0,One strap is shorter than the other. But not a big deal for the price. My daughter loves them.
2.0,"Very narrow.  Pinched the bridge of my nose painfully.  Then the strap clip broke, so I ditched them."
2.0,"Really cute, but broke after 1 wear"
2.0,"You can wear this with a slip, but even then it is way too see through. It was so cute on but if the material was a little thicker it would have been perfect. I ended up returning it."
2.0,Button fell off before I could even put it on.
2.0,The watch keeps opening when wearing it. Otherwise very nice band
2.0,"These shoes are HUGE! My son is a size 6t border 7t so we ordered a 7. These are more of an 8t or older. While they’re cute and we plan on keeping them for when he’s older, it’s disappointing because now we have to purchase another pair for now."
2.0,"Definitely should have read the reviews.  It runs pretty small, especially in waist and leg area.  Definitely order a size up.  I also don't really like the material.  They are like a fake jean material, just looks weird."
2.0,Worked for its intended purpose but the collar was uncomfortable.
2.0,Don't really like it.
2.0,More for a child than a woman.
2.0,"Product a bit see thru, cute for the beach or tropical vaca throw on fit. Thin material."
2.0,It fits me way too loose. The top metal rings hangs in between my breasts vs above them. Sending back.
2.0,its make my legs more wet as usual !!
2.0,Tops are true to size.  Bottoms are cut very short in crotch and waist is tight elastic.
2.0,"cute but not what i expected. i'd rather have gotten the one without the tiny cz. i personally think it would have looked much better. the cz is way to small. it make it easy too catch /snag clothing. i made a boo-boo when picking this item. now, don't get me wrong the quality is great, but they could have left the cz off, too small to even matter."
2.0,havent even used it was way to big
2.0,"Sent it back. Material was very shiny, and cheap looking. The flowers looked like they were ironed on."
2.0,While the garment overall looks nice and the fabric is good quality and is well constructed the overall fit of this kimono is extremely small for an xxl. At best this would fit a preteen. The search continues!
2.0,Super cheap quality. Didn't care for them.
2.0,Not well put together- strings hanging off everywhere after washing. Not very warm.
2.0,They are nice quality but for someone with a very thin neck and tiny head. Or great for a child.
2.0,"I was trying to get a pair of pajama's similar to the Kim Rogers brand, the PajamaGram's are nice, but not what I expected. I've seen so many commercials of PajamaGram's I assumed they would be a better buy since they cost approx $20 more.<br />Since they were an anniversary gift, my wife has ""acted"" pleased but she sure wears the Kim Roger's MORE!!<br />From what I can see, they're well made but so are the Kim Rogers brand - right now I'm just saying ""Lesson Learned"""
2.0,Very narrow for average foot size even after going up a full size.
2.0,Omg so cute material great sexy omg deal of a lifetime 19.99 but what's the point of it don't fit at all what do ever .the corset or shirt really is so small I wear a XL but figured buy 3x and take it in cause it was cheaper omg I'm not a 3x at all meaning way to big and it's way 2 small what are these people on . I have got to assume the wrong tag was put on this corset . In shock . My bottom is bigger shirt can be taken in but it's big jeeesh don't buy it unless u can use a sewing machine
2.0,This shirt I made from a really thin material.  If you order the white one it’s transparent and you can see through them.
2.0,The shoe runs big my doughter still hasn’t wear them.
2.0,It's a very odd design the waist extends pass the hip measurements so the cut of the pants is very awkward
2.0,They didn't grip my heel and did slip off into my shoes.
2.0,"It’s cute, thought it would be thicker. It’s like a thin summer time shirt"
2.0,Make sure you read the specifications because it may not fit you.
2.0,"Poor quality...description said business blazer but felt more like a shirt. Definitely not to be worn for a business meeting. To top of, came very wrinkled."
2.0,It arrived with blood on it! I gave it a two star because it looked like it could be cute and a nice material. Hopefully others have better luck...
2.0,"the colors of art are very opaque, they look old, nothing bright.  I do not recommend them"
2.0,"I ordered this mask for a Halloween costume. The mask itself is decent quality, but the eyeholes are so small I could not see and needed to cut them bigger. I also needed to cut a hole near the mouth area so I could breathe. With some finessing we made it work but was less than ideal for Halloween night. Overall, this mask would be better for display and not for actual wear."
2.0,"As a result of how tiny the star is, every time I tried to screw it to the back it fell out of my hands or out of the pliers. Well, it fell somewhere on the floor of my bathroom and with a flashlight both myself and my husband couldn't find it. Oh well. At least it didn't cost too much."
2.0,Did not  set a nice crease and was difficult to remove wrinkles.
2.0,Very hard to make out features of this ring
2.0,Look good but get what you pay for.  The frames are weak and glass is rediiculously thin.  Add the fact that when I wear them I feel like my vision gets worse. Wouldn't recommend.
2.0,color is good.
2.0,The temples are too tight and they hurt my head when I have the glasses on over my prescription glasses.  I will be returning them.
2.0,Nice but missing the backs
2.0,Runs REALLY small. I even had my daughter try it on (she wears a 4/6) and she said it was uncomfortably small. If you're not curvy at all it might work for you.
2.0,Scratchy polyester material with no give to it. Tight across the chest and short. Did not like.
2.0,These shrink quite a bit in the wash. He only got to wear it a few times before it was to small .
2.0,"Was very excited to wear this dress to work shortly after I received it in the mail. It fits according to size (I'm a size 4/6 and ordered a small), but the zipper broke on the first zip! I love the style and the way it fits, so I may try adding a new zipper."
2.0,It's an ok dress... you cant see the split for real unless you stick your leg out purposefully.
2.0,Material wanted to give after a few hours of wearing. And I'm a small to med size person.
2.0,"The dress is very cute! The color and style are very pretty, fits perfectly, love the pockets, the material is thin but not at all transparent. However, I had to send it back because it is soooo poorly made that it's unwearable.  It's asymmetric almost everywhere, like it was cut by a 5 year old."
2.0,"These camis seem to have more nylon fabric than cotton. If you like nylon this is a good product, but not for me."
2.0,"I usually wear M/L but ordered an XL and they are still very small with little stretch. They are very short, more like capris on me. I am 5'8. I returned these and went straight to the actual tactical supply shop, they're having a 25% off sale right now for Xmas and I know they'll be the real deal."
2.0,"I really wanted to keep this dirndl because I love the color and the material and construction seems very durable. However, at 169.00 USD, the white embroidery should be connecting all the way around the hem. There is no excuse for why someone cannot take the care to match up the stitches at this price point. I bought three of these hoping to get one that was acceptable. The second was better than the first and the third, but still not good enough at this cost."
2.0,"ordered a size 10, which is my husbands typical size, but they were way too small"
2.0,"I have a pretty small head and this fits me really tight. Receiver piece free floats inside hat with only tiny piece of Velcro holding it in place. Said Velcro is poorly applied, broke off first day of use. Hat fits tight and weird, not sure how they found a model to make it look so good in the pics, must have taken them a LONG time to find that guy. Redemption: after inspecting the packaging I found a small pack with extra Velcro, too bad I already super glued the old one back on"
2.0,"Nice look, light and good frames. I like the fact it comes with holder straps and a cloth carrying bag rather than a hard plastic case I'll end up throwing out. Unfortunately, they tend to break easily. The frame around the lenses in the lower half, where it's thinner, broke on both my pairs. The first time I figured I was too rough, the second I was careful not to put any undue strain on them and it still broke. Also, the rubber fastener that goes around the glasses to hold them around your neck broke."
2.0,"These boots are very cute, but they are not thigh high. I bought both the leopard print and the zebra print, West Boulevard - Thigh - High boots, at the same time. The leopard print are thigh high, but the zebra print only come up to my knees."
2.0,"Shirt is tighter than a standard XL. Did not like the pre-rolled sleeves, made them very short and will have to be ironed after every wash. Length is perfect."
2.0,The glasses did not look like the picture.  They were plastic and cheap looking. Looked like glasses in a toy kit.
2.0,"I’m a postpartum woman trying to find a dress for a funeral. (Moment of silence for anyone in this same boat) Sadly this dress is not doing me ANY favors. I went by the size chart and ordered an XL. I’m 5’5, weigh 198 lbs, 38D, 44” bust, 37” waist, 47” postpartum belly. Right now my belly still sticks out past my chest, so the smallest part of me is right under my bust. Wrap dresses and empire waist maxis look good, so maybe this cut just isn’t right for my current silhouette.<br /><br />The problem with this dress for me is that the waist fits perfectly, but the chest area is way too loose. I can fit both my fists in front of my chest and there’s still excess fabric lol. If I size down, the chest may fit but then the waist will be too small. The waist already shows my back fat now, so sizing down would be even worse. Also, the sleeve length and skirt length are just too long on me in a frumpy, unflattering way.<br /><br />This is probably super cute on more hourglass body types."
2.0,"Smaller than expected, did take a long time to ship and they are not suitable to be worn outdoor"
2.0,"The very first pair that I selected to wear ripped as I was putting them on. These are definately not thick socks. I can say that they are big enough to fit comfortably aroumd my calves. I have worn a couple.other pairs and they are comfortable. It may be that there was a quality issue with just that one pair, but at nearly $6 a pair, I wish they would send me another pair to make up for the pair that ripped."
2.0,These are made for small faces only. They are not one size fits all
2.0,The feel of the fabric is great.  The waist was too tight.
2.0,I wished they had more brown.
2.0,"I don’t know what the deal is but after receiving it and setting it, the watch died after about an hour. This happened several times so I thought maybe it needed a battery change so I went and got a new battery installed at a shop and I’m still having the same problem :("
2.0,Look as if it was worn before. Came crushed and the color is  pale. It doesn't look like the picture.
2.0,"Much shorter than I expected, sleeves are kind of awkward. Haven’t brought myself to wear it more than once."
2.0,Poor fit. I have an althetic  body. Normally a size small. 34b. Fit awkward. Returned
2.0,Size runs too big.  Material not what I expected.  Returning it.
2.0,"cute style but absolutely no support for the chest, had thin cup liners that didn't quite fit in the openings and felt uncomfortable.  Maybe ok for a smaller cup size like A or B - but not my 36D's. Runs a bit large as well.  returned"
2.0,"I was so excited to get these and wear them to Walmart. Much to my dismay, I tried to get them on and couldn't get them up halfway my calf. Very disappointed. Prefect if you walk on #2 pencils."
2.0,This is made of odd material. And the only way it can be worn is off the shoulder because it has an odd cut.  I have only wore this once and will probably never wear it again.
2.0,This fabric does not. Breathe.  Very hot and clinging
2.0,"Only good for digging like a dog or badge I guess.  I wish I had returned them in time.  Was super excited about the concept but thought the claws would be finger tip size, not horror movie sized LOL. Can't hold tools or do anything except dig with them LOL"
2.0,"Very lightweight and soft, but HUGE in the chest, even when using the size chart."
2.0,Cheap material~
2.0,The cup is very small I ordered a DD and it did not fit well
2.0,"These pants are very cute but they are not petite friendly. I'm 5'2 and they are incredibly long. MIGHT be able to pull them off in really tall wedges, otherwise will have to get them altered.<br />They also have an incredibly short inseam! If this weren't the case and I could pull these up high enough, they might not be as long in the legs. Pants like these (paper bag waist) are meant to be high-waisted and that is NOT the case with these! The pictures are extremely misleading!!! They DO NOT go up to your waist. I would go as far as to say that I consider these to be low rise. NOT what you want in this type of pant.<br />Would be great if they didn't have this design flaw.<br />The material is nice and thick, the color is true black and they look very nice and dressy. They just don't fit right. Even for taller women, these just wouldn't work since the ""inseam is so incredibly short."
2.0,"Received wrong pants, not same as pictures😡"
2.0,Thin. Blech. Not heavy.<br />Bad for warmth.
2.0,I don't like it.  Cheaply made.  The quality is well below what I expect from Coach.
2.0,Clasp broke on first wearing.  Enough said.
2.0,"Took over a month to arrive. Elastic was broken in one sleeve. Cute shirt that fit true yo size, but cheap quality."
2.0,I like the style of the shirts however I do not like the material
2.0,It's too short
2.0,"They fit the kids well, but unfortunately there is one pair has a hole on it!"
2.0,"These neck gaiters were too small for my 8 year old boy (he struggled to pull it over his head) and 6 and 4 year old girls (very tight). Since they are being advertised as 'child size', I give them only 2 stars since they did not fit my kids comfortably. They did not stretch as much as I anticipated. Also the material was more difficult to breath through than the 'ice silk' material many of the other gaiters are made of. My 6 year old daughter especially said she was not able to breath through it very well.<br /><br />There was nothing wrong with the quality of the product however. The stitching looked fine. The colors were consistent with the ad."
2.0,The glasses are not welded together properly. They are welded in slag position and the part that goes on the ears one does not bend. I brought two pairs this was my second and it was a bad make
2.0,Wayyyy too short. Had to return :(<br />I am 5'7&#34; with an athletic build.  Otherwise a cute dress - but only for a very short person.
2.0,"I'm a size 16, I bought an XX Large in purple. It fit great. The issue was the color. The top, lace part of the the dress was a completely different purple from the bottom. Not like the picture at all."
2.0,"Stones were too big for a bracelet, it really is poor quality."
2.0,Cheap product craftsmanship
2.0,I loved this at first. Then I washed it and it shrunk length-wise terribly so I only got one wear out of it.
2.0,"Product was missing the little plastic stopper to prevent the knob from being pushed and clock ticking. The watch stopped, not if it was used, low battery or the mechanics were badly made. The frame itself was good though."
2.0,I didn't like this shirt at all. It is so square that my shoulders look very masculine. I cannot even picture myself wearing it in a smaller size. I gave it away. I am sure you can buy something nicer for the same money.
2.0,what was described with this like it was not what I got to do not expect it to be so bulky so I had to return it and then ended up paying The postal. The description was inaccurate and the measurements were incorrect. I will not purchase anything from this manufacture again.
2.0,"Although the costume itself was nice, the headband ears didnt sit properly on my childs head and kept falling off. Also it would have been nice if the gloves would have been added."
2.0,"Toddler size was way off. Far too small. They need to re-look at their sizing.<br /><br />The hat was very nice though, however we had to send it back."
2.0,"I ordered a large, I’m normally a US size 6 and it fits but I was looking for it to be more baggy like in the picture. I think I would have to order a 2X to get that look. Also in the picture it has big thick ties and the one I received just had normal shoe lace ties which is a disappointing atheistic"
2.0,The long strap broke within a week
2.0,Didn't keep a fitted shape after being washed.
2.0,Received. Appeared to be poor quality. Smelled like toxic chemicals too. Returned.
2.0,These fit very strange. Was not happy with the quality.
2.0,"This top/sweater, is verrry loose fitting.  It is also quite thin fabric wise; not expected to be so thin !  You have to continually keep arranging the neckline, so that it stays where it's supposed to stay!  I wore it Over another fitted top, so as not to show my body underneath.  Fabric was expected to be a bit heavier, so it would stay in place.<br />I would NOT buy this again!!<br /><br />June Shaar/Roger Holcomb"
2.0,Be Careful with Sizing
2.0,It's nice n flowy..the do run a little big so next time I will order a size smaller than usual.
2.0,"I like the comfort and warmth of these.  However, I've only had them for two months and some of the rubber grip coating has peeled off.  Also, it seems like one of the seams is starting to tear.  I'm not sure how long these are going to end up lasting."
2.0,"It fit well and had a great stretch, but I hate that clingy shiny stretchy fabric that shows every imperfection. I returned the dress."
2.0,"I had high hopes for the dress!  The color in person was beautiful, but when I took it out of the bag I realized the material wasn't a very good quality.  Also the fit was not quite right. The body was very roomy but the sleeves were extremely tight without any stretch.  I would say I'm about an average size 12 height 5 6 so it should have fit me fine but it was both too big and too small.<br />I did give it two stars for the color and pattern.  I really wanted to like it, but it had to be returned."
2.0,"order up like two sizes.  I seriously could not even get the bra part on it was so small!  I ordered my usual size, but decided not to bother ordering up because I couldn't imagine it fitting even then."
2.0,"The size fits nice and snug for me, the tag is very itchy though I would much prefer an iron on tag that everyone else seems to be using these days, I will have to try to rip these off if I can do it without ripping the fabric. I was also disappointed with my &#34;assorted&#34; colors. I paid the extra $5 to get the colors expecting to see some red, light blue, or yellow as shown in the picture but what I got were two black pairs, a grey pair, and a dark blue pair that almost look black. I could've gone with the cheaper option and just gotten black and grey to begin with. Also, on only the second time wearing, two of the pairs ripped along the seam. Very cheaply made, would never purchase again nor would I suggest anyone else purchase these. Save your Kirby and go with Gildan you want a more snug fit or fruit of the loom or hanes for better quality"
2.0,"'The dog need something to chew on', poor English. I took a felt tip pen and changed it to 'the dogs need something to chew on', nonetheless the pic is cute but the rug itself is about the thickness of an oven liner, very poor quality and improper verbiage, not a good investment"
2.0,"SOOOOO disappointed. The fabric is beautiful and the dress well made, but the fit is just all wrong. I don't know if it's supposed to be an empire waist, but the bodice is VERY high waisted so the skirt part begins right below the bust. NOT flattering on me, especially since the skirt only comes to my knees. It was appropriate sizing--the large fit properly, and I usually wear size 10-12--but it did not look right at all. I will be returning this immediately."
2.0,"I wear an 11.5 wide in American boots. My Bata bunny boots are 10.5 extra wide and fit great. I can barely get my foot in these duck boots. Also the insulation appears to be pretty much a layer of cloth. Not tested in the cold, but I live in Ak and wouldn't trust these in real cold. Returning them for poor fit. They are probably fine if you have narrow feet, can get a fit, and live in a reasonably temperate climate."
2.0,The skull and crossbones are not centered on the shirt. Shirt material is uncomfortable.
2.0,"Unfortunately, I did not look closely at the photo or I would have seen that this is just an unfinished piece of fabric.  It is super floppy and shapeless.  Only thing it is good for is to wear around the house like a robe."
2.0,Mask to small for adult use.
2.0,Crappy plastic like fabric. Not durable
2.0,Ugh! These glasses look nothing like the picture. The snake is extremely big and the whole design is just too exaggerating. I wish they were a lot more subtle.
2.0,Disappointed! Not what I expected.
2.0,The short legs were not flare enough Too tight
2.0,Product arrived damaged. Ring itself is pretty. But having the stone separate from the ring is not what I ordered nor wanted.
2.0,"The color is vibrant and the material is comfy.  However, I ordered up one size and it is still too small... mostly in length and I am of average height (5'7)."
2.0,"I'm 5'1&#34; and 105 lbs. I ordered the smallest size, and it was still huge. Had it fit, I would have needed to wear a slip with it since it was see through. I ordered the navy. It was pretty, just didn't work out for me. Return was easy."
2.0,Not military grade buckle
2.0,Much too large for a woman especially with the cartoon type design. Would have loved it if it was small. Returned.
2.0,"Ears are tiny and they sit together at the top of your head (what cat has ears like that?), the tail is too thick and matty."
2.0,"Felt gross on, but maybe that’s just me."
2.0,Bad design and overpriced.
2.0,"After applying to sigar color suede boots, the leather turned dark brown and the ombre began to disappear. The color of the shoes changed in a bad way and spoiled the suede."
2.0,"Like I do with everything, when I purchase on Amazon I always look for 4 or 5-star ratings.  I bought these because of the 13 5-star ratings/ reviews. Sorry, I have to give it a 2.  I found them to be very difficult to put on.  A very strong and tight clip that I had to push down with tremendous pressure to clip them on.  I figured after doing this for some time I would find an easier way of doing it, but not so.  I’m scared of breaking my glasses with so much pressure to install them.  After the 3rd time the rubber on the tips of the clip broke through exposing metal (see picture).  I have no doubt that eventually they will scratch my lenses. Sorry but these will be returned.  I’m going to buy a different one from Amazon but will be looking for one with more than 13 reviews."
2.0,It's cute...and fits...but doesn't sit right. Weird.
2.0,"Looks cheaper in person. Nylon hosiery type fabric, runs small, looks cheap."
2.0,"The boots were too small. While I liked the material and was confident from the start that it would keep my feet dry, it also pulled down my socks and caused my leggings to rise up when I was wearing them, so they would rub against my legs and the backs of my feet."
2.0,"The picture is deceiving as it looks like is it oversized when it really isn’t.  The product description states it’s plus size but I normally wear 2X in plus size and this fits more like an XL or, at best, a 1X. The fabric is not very soft either.  Thankfully I was able to return it for a refund!"
2.0,"I was excited to order this and when it arrived I opened it up to find that the red on the material had bleed into the white part of the suit. There was one BIG PINK spot on the right side of the chest and another on the back of the head. it was also MISSING the little chick that is supposed to be in the pocket. The buttons are WAY too small for the holes so it would open every now and then on its own. It did fit well, but for someone that is taller than 5.4 it will be too short in the legs.<br />I would not recommend buying this. After reading the reviews (after I bought it) and others complained about the stains throughout their onesie as well. Too bad. I might be able to get to stain out but it stucks about the little missing chick for the pocket."
2.0,"Fabric is okay, just okay but its too large. I can't wear this."
2.0,"Cheaply made, scratchy fabric, returned"
2.0,shirt was to short in length
2.0,"the number 12 is not centered on the top of watch and the bezel is too loose and moves constantly. it needs to be wound twice a day as it stopped twice. It's good looking, but the Moon/Sun indicator just spins around and doesn't show any moon phase, which the picture leads you to believe."
2.0,"Such a beautiful dress but not durable. Didnt get a chance to wear it. Bought a lil small bc the last dress i bought was a bit looser and i like a snug fit and the material is stretchy so i went for a L instead of XL (5'3&#34; 195 lb, curvy). Tried to pull over my head once bc i was by myself and realized that wouldn't work so i got a friend to help me. Zipper kept getting stuck until we realized the actual zipper itself was separating from the dress in that spot. Very small section but the part that clenches to the zipper was essentially going through the space between the zipper and material. Very disappointed. Obviously it may have been my fault, I just felt i didnt use that much force when trying to pull it over which worked with the other dress (diff style but same patterns/material). Id say to be aware that even though the material feels durable the stitching is not. Otherwise it was a beautiful dress with great colors in the pattern. Just a waste of $ when you have to pay extra to replace the whole zipper of a new dress."
2.0,"Heavy and uncomfortable, also broke easily."
2.0,Material is very cheap!
2.0,Just too baggy to work out in but quality was great
2.0,"I had barely worn these socks, and they've already developed a hole in the big toe area (and there is no toenail)."
2.0,"I bought these and was very surprised that they didn't even resemble the picture.  Very small, thin and dull finish.  Look very cheap.  Very disappointed.  Glad I didn't pay much for them because I will never wear them."
2.0,This dress is more of a cover up for a bathing suit. It is very open in the front especially when you tie the waist.
2.0,The dress design is great and fits great but the material from which it is made is very cheap. The dress arrived already frayed at the seams. Returned for refund.
2.0,The reason I’m giving it two stars is because they are so cute and so fun. But they don’t block the sun very well and the worst part is they break very easily. Obviously you get what you pay for but the metal on these frames sucks and break off.
2.0,"Super thin design. They look nice, but scratch easily."
2.0,"The material was fine; soft with no shine to it, but the shirt was way too long and large. I am 5' 6&#34; tall and weigh about 125 lbs."
2.0,These gloves are not windproof cause when I'm riding the mower you can still feel the wind get through the gloves
2.0,I bought this in size 16  for a party; it ended in my best friend hands that is size 10!!!!
2.0,The size indicator led me to believe they were for childs small feet but they were actually big enough to fit a 13 year old.  I may keep them for her to grow into.
2.0,These shorts are cheap and not as attractive as the picture.  Once you wash them the fabric starts beading into fuzz balls.
2.0,I admired them very much. So hard to put on.
2.0,Went by measurements and added a few inches but it was still too small
2.0,It’s spray painted black.
2.0,Wig was suppose to be new. The Wig looked like it had either been warn or tried on was matted.
2.0,"I ordered this dress recently , its a beautiful dress however it looked worn and for that I was displeased but over all a nice dress."
2.0,"Good quality, but huuuuuuge!<br />I would not buy this if you have a small frame.<br />It's has way to much fabric."
2.0,"Not one size fits all type of arm band, Its big on me as a female, no compression"
2.0,"While this is a beautiful watch, it does not autowind, and even manually winding it will not give you 24 hours running.<br />Unless you are willing to wind it every 12 hours - spend your money elsewhere."
2.0,"OK so this was my fault for not paying attention to measurements, but never did I imagine that two tiny umbrellas would cost $14. If two tiny $14 umbrellas is what you’re looking for, these are perfectly fine. I was looking for actual shade so these will not be satisfactory😕"
2.0,I ordered yellow #2 and received a very pale yellow. The tailoring actually looks like they were made for dolls or as a Halloween costume and not to actually be worn as clothing by humans. Would have been less surprised if I had actually ordered these on wish.
2.0,I like the color beautiful. I wanted to use this dress to attend a corporate day time event. However the dress is made with thin Jersey material and ruching pleats are not as full as the picture.  This dress is for Sunday Icecream run.
2.0,Returned because it was too heavy and clunky for hot weather.
2.0,"I wasn't that crazy about this item,  it looked cheap."
2.0,The back rubber part that sits on your face keeps coming off and putting it back on when you are deep in the sauce is really really difficult. Not even mad that I lost it in the end.
2.0,"I gave this to my boyfriend as a Christmas present. The fit was excellent (he is 6'4&#34; and I got him the XL/XXL). The robe is so soft and plush and he loved it. I was really excited because now this meant I could finally throw out the terrible robe he's been wearing for 3 years. However, it quickly became apparent that the terrible robe was destined to remain in my life because after one wash, the Del Rossa robe SHED EVERYWHERE. I mean, this robe left fuzzies in every nook and cranny of our apartment. Fuzzies in his beard, fuzzies on the cat, fuzzies on every item of clothing. EVERYWHERE. No amount of washing seems to help. Without exaggeration, we have washed and dried the Del Rossa robe no less 10 times (following the manufacturers specifications) and it still sheds just as much as as ever. What a fail."
2.0,I liked the glasses and they were comfortable until I realized one of the lenses was not in correctly and I could not get it to pop in place.  They will be going back.
2.0,Too small for the size had to give them to my 12 year old niece.
2.0,Too small. Did not fit as expected.
2.0,"I purchased XXL but I typically wear L/XL. It does feel soft but ... The buttons though, I thought they'll be good but disappointed with the quality. Why would you send something with threads hanging out?"
2.0,The coat is soft It’s very pretty but no buttons I don’t want to be walking around with My chest all out the purpose of a coat is the clothes across your chest to keep you warm where is the buttonsThere’s no buttons on this coat You could have stuck a least three nice size buttons on this coat
2.0,The dress is very nice but the material is very thin and see-through
2.0,The bottoms fit fine. The top is way to loose with no support.
2.0,Not durable enough all I got to say as well uncomfortable 😕
2.0,"It was very flimsy, it broke as I tried to snap it closed."
2.0,This is too easy for the baby to pull off and the brim is distorted. Cute print though!
2.0,The toy jewels fall off.
2.0,Fits as expected but is a little long
2.0,"The flannel seems inferior to flannels from Orvis, Eddie Bauer, and LL Bean."
2.0,They are not good boots to walk in
2.0,"&#34;You get what you pay for&#34;, for a small product that shipped in a box of 3.5&#34; x 3.5&#34; took forever to get...almost 1 month.  The box is poor quality!  The watch is A ok?  Could got something better in the states and much nicer."
2.0,Like others have stated the pull tab broke. Mine only lasted a week before it broke
2.0,"I ordered 4 pairs of these in the XL for my husband band. They are supposed to fit a 36-38 inch waist. They do not fit a 36-38 inch waist, even with all the stretch tabs completely loose. I would recommend going up 2 sizes. We will not be purchasing again, the seller requires YOU to pay the return shipping. If the other sizes didn't fit either, then we would be out even more money for products sized incorrectly."
2.0,"When I received it I was excited to try it on. However, the length is simply too short. Any time I would lean forward, it would pull up and show my back! Not good. I’m 5’6 and 130 pounds. It shouldn’t have been this short. In addition the fabric was extremely thin! It was a crepey feel and paper thin. I had to return it. It looked so much better on the model - please take my word for it. I hope I’ve helped you in some way. Consider giving a thumbs up on my review if it did help in some way. Thank you!"
2.0,"These started falling apart within the first month of my son wearing them. He doesn't wear them outside, mostly while sitting at his computer. There's no reason they should be falling apart so soon."
2.0,"They are very pretty but very stiff once you manage to get them on, which is very hard."
2.0,The shirt fits Amazon on your back!!! But my chest is too heavy. I was falling out the bottom. The material is so thin if I worn it outside the material would have came apart. Not worth the money.
2.0,"I got these pants in mail, package was not damaged just dirty but, on the back side of it (left butt cheek was broken) hole in it. Returning these, not good product."
2.0,"Cute but cut runs small.  I bought a Medium as a gift for adult woman but saw how small around the waist was.  My skinny13 year old tried on, could zip it but was still tight around the hips.  Went to return item to find they take money from my refund to do so."
2.0,"not good, legs of classes are easy to break"
2.0,The bra itself is fine but the straps are too short even if adjusted to the maximum.
2.0,"I ordered the gray and black to go with some crop leggings I have. Instead I received black and white. I think the stark contrast is to busy looking for my taste. I won't go through the trouble of trying to return it but I won't be reordering again worrying that I'll get the same color again. It is a nice material and fits a bit too snug through the chest and across shoulderblades, being a full figured gal.  If you are also, I suggest sizing up from normal size."
2.0,I ordered this product in a large and found it fit more like a medium. I had trouble even getting my head into the whole. My advice is to size up.
2.0,there just a lil to big. pluss they had two small holes in the front. im glad I got a different  brand as a back up pair
2.0,Runs small. No stretch
2.0,"Only 106 beads. In making malas you follow the power of 9s - 108=1+08=9. Malas can be made of 18 beads, 27, 36, 54, and I I didn't expect too much for this price but I at least expected the correct number of beads for this &#34;Mala&#34;  - 108 -  wrist malas made of 21 (for Tibetan Buddhist) and 99 or 33 (for Muslims) - still the 9 appears in the form of a 3 at all times - 3x3=9.  This particular item ONLY has 106 low quality beads (several stuck together) divided by even cheaper plastic spacers.<br />It also is not a Rosary - a Catholic Rosary has 59 beads. 53 beads for Hail Mary & 6 Our Fathers.<br /><br />This item is only good for decoration.  Therefore giving it 2 stars because it will be used by my granddaughter to take apart and use the beads"
2.0,Cute necklace but after one wear stones are falling out:(
2.0,I ordered a larger size and it still didn't fit! Way too small!
2.0,"I was very upset and disappointed when I received my earrings in the mail.  They were nowhere near as pink and colorful as the picture displayed.  In the picture, the earrings are bright and vibrant and that is not what I got in the mail.  I feel that the picture has been edited to make them look better than they actually are.  There are hundreds of thousands of earrings for sale and I chose these and now I feel like this company tricked me into buying something I wouldn't have bought if I had seen it in person.  I will never trust any of the products that this company advertises because they falsely represent their merchandise. Never again."
2.0,"Super cute, but runs very small.  I suggest if you...for example...wear a large, get an XL."
2.0,"Worked well and looks ok, but the plastic band was irritating to wear. Suffocated skin underneath and made it sweaty, and it wasn't easy to rotate it around when it was uncomfortable."
2.0,They are shorter than they appear in photo
2.0,"This seemed like decent material but the fit was way, way too large.  I suspect this product suffers from uneven sizing."
2.0,"Quality was nice enough, but the cut was bulky and not very stylish.  Had to return."
2.0,very tight fit too small material is very thin
2.0,Uh....where is the pizza pin?! That was the main reason I bought this set! So disappointed.
2.0,"cute but fits weird, feels odd on- tighter in areas like under the arms. The plain version in the same size is a smidge too big and this feels too tight."
2.0,"I had such high hopes for this sweater but just couldn't love it.  I liked the colors but I wouldn't say they were exactly as pictured.  My biggest objection was the sizing - - I ordered down to an xs and the sweater still swallowed me, especially in the shoulders and sleeves.  The horizontal stripes didn't help downplay the sizing odd sizing.  The material was soft and a nice thickness."
2.0,Did not like the pleating.  Returned item.
2.0,I bought my regular size which is the Medium but it is too tight in the chest area. The material is good. I think it would have been better if i had bought a Large.
2.0,I love the color but it is made very thin. it will bend. it comes in 2 pieces but they come off your phone very easily. It will work for awhile but I am not really happy with it.
2.0,"Great overall FIT, and decent QUALITY. But the COLOR on the “Dark Grey” cap is way off. It’s very clearly a light PURPLE...not grey. Seller either needs to change their description or actually make the product the correct color. This was a waste of my time and it’s getting returned."
2.0,"The sinching on the side was too high on the dress, next to the breast, not on the waste.  The color didn't lay right like it does in the picture either."
2.0,the letters and labeling can barely be seen and not as shown in photo..
2.0,"Unfortunately this arrived without any hardware or instructions to assemble. The only option that Amazon is giving me is to fully replace the umbrella, which is very heavy and a lot of effort to repack. I wish there was a way to contact the actual company to get the bolts, but I cannot find any means to via Amazon or through searching Google."
2.0,"Ordered the correct size, but was incredibly small. Not at all what I expected. Very thin and flimsy. Would likely fall apart very quickly due to being cheaply made. Not at all worth $30. Would not recommend buying this, big waste of money. Returned item."
2.0,"Very cute, but handle broke the first time my daughter wore them, so I returned them"
2.0,Though the price is low it is very poor quality. The piece I received only has space for 4 photos unlike what’s stated and pictured. The hinges are very flimsy and the “gold” coating is cheap looking.
2.0,Really pretty.  Like crazy pretty.  But no stretch at all and not for a body with hips.  If you have an athletic body this will be very flattering.  I have an hourglass shape and this didn’t even come close.<br />If you have the right body type you’ll love it but remember there is zero stretch and the cinch back doesn’t make up for it sadly.  Really wish I could have worn it because it’s beautiful in person.
2.0,"It's nice, but too big for me."
2.0,So cute but sooooo big. My niece wears 9 month clothing so I thought the 6-12 month size would be a good range for her. First bad buy since I've been an Amazon shopper.
2.0,Nice sneaker however the straps started to fall apart on both sneakers after three weeks. The body of the sneaker is great.
2.0,"But to be clear, it's bigger than I wanted and won't fit into my back pockets, but it was more my fault than Amazons.  Did take a long time to get here (prolly cause it came from China or somewhere).  Again, it's just hard to shop online for some items, this was one."
2.0,"They are good paracord clips, but when I ran the webbing through the top it wouldn't grab the webbing so it slipped all the way down to the clip. I need them to stay in place when I tighten them and they won't stay they slip back to the clip without any effort."
2.0,"First wash, and the color fade away. Now the black is gray."
2.0,"While they look nice and are sturdy, I have to pull the bar in and out to get the earrings open because the clip it too tight. It is a pain, even though &#34;you get what you pay for&#34; I have had better earrings for the same price."
2.0,"Very bright and cute color, BUT within just 2 days the case is already dirty from jeans stain."
2.0,The grey is clearly NOT grey.  It is purple.  Would have been fine if it had actually been the color as described.
2.0,"Ordered the L/XL and the socks are short, meaning they only half way up the calf. They don't stay in place and always slip down to the ankle. But you get what you pay for."
2.0,Rusted right away
2.0,They are cute...but the inside sole is not very long lasting...
2.0,Se puso de color negro. ¨No parece plata
2.0,"Size chart is wrong! Get at least one size larger than what you usually wear. Fabric is thin, gave this set to a friend who is smaller. They look nice will wait til I wash them......"
2.0,Ugh! So disappointing. The fabric is shiny polyester. I look like Mrs. Roper. The dress fits too big and is frumpy.
2.0,TOO SMALL... But i won't tell my mom she could but it and suffer.. she bugs me a lot!!
2.0,"Very stretchy.  Not much compression. I wear under shirts or athletic style undershirts under workshirts. These do not cover my chest adequately.  Lots of side cleveage. Arm holes are way to big.  Granted, I'm the only one who knows about it. But still not what I was hoping for.  Will not buy again."
2.0,It's cute but this runs small
2.0,Crotch length was not good. It gathered and snatch where it should be relaxed this was a no for me
2.0,I bought these about 6 months ago. The pin on the glasses keeps coming out and I've had to get it replaced 3 times already. The gold rim has faded and now parts are silver and parts are gold. Not happy at all.
2.0,The back seam ripped and fabric frayed after wearing it twice.  They need better sticking on delicate fabric.
2.0,Chain was broken when i received the item
2.0,It's ok not what I expected.. very sheer
2.0,My order was defective. Ordered a replacement — hopefully that one works!
2.0,"I liked it, my wife thought it was two small and I ordered a size up... oh well"
2.0,It fits well but it’s more of a female underwear than male - there is no Y front which means you must pull your pants to pee ; hate that 👎🏿
2.0,I’m normally a small/medium and the medium BARELY fit. It suffocated my arms and the fit on the chest was awkward and unflattering. Loved the color and the fabric but unfortunately had to return
2.0,Hermoso diasño
2.0,Not the best quality..thin fiber PJ
2.0,"The fabric on this dress is odd; the top is a fine jersey material but the skirt is very heavy and stiff, and does not drape well. I ordered both an XL and L to see which fit better: the large fit me well but the pockets stuck out at an odd angle because of the skirt material, and the XL was just too large in the top although the pockets fared better with the larger size. Had to return both, which is a shame because the black and white fabric pattern was very cute."
2.0,NOT THE BEST QUALITY.  LION NOT CLEAR.  SHOULD BE USED WITH HALLOWEEN COSTUMES<br />ONLY.
2.0,Cheaply made for the price.
2.0,it breaks too easily. its also really flimsy
2.0,"Not long sleeve more like a quarter sleeve, looks like a cap and gown cape. Not worth it."
2.0,Very comfortable material but after several hand washing they get stretched out.
2.0,No any my stads earrings can’t fit the hole.  No magic happen
2.0,One of the stones fell out within the first 2 weeks of wearing it. Stones smaller than expected.
2.0,"I loved this watch band and received many compliments however, it didn't last long.  After wearing it for 6 weeks one of the straps (around the hinges) became unglued.  Since the window to return had just closed, I superglued it and proceed on wearing it.  Unfortunately, today, the clasp fell off so I have to say good bye to my Apple Watch for a few days before my new bands arrive.  I have learned a lesson though...I WILL NEVER BUY A BAND LIKE THIS AGAIN!!!"
2.0,SEams were loosely stitched and looked like they would unravel soon.
2.0,"The material is aweful, pretty see-through if you were doing squats or yoga. They aren't compression leggings and the fit around the ankle is lose and weird."
2.0,Very pretty but if you have large boobs don't even try it and it's completely sheer.
2.0,Broke before wearing them. So cute too. I was sad.
2.0,These are way too big and don’t cover well at all. I’m constantly adjusting the ear loops and trying to cover the lower half of my face better but then it comes off my nose. There’s no tight seal at all around the face. Designs are cute but that’s the only plus
2.0,Such a cute buckle but belt itself is way too long and even punching holes doesn't do the job.
2.0,When I opened it the heart stone was not attached to the necklace so I had to make the repair. It doesn't lay evenly either when you wear it. The chain is dirty looking and scratchy on your skin.
2.0,Would be nicer to have the 2 of them but they only sent one. It looks cool and is light weight but it looks like I’m not the only one who wasted time with this one.
2.0,Shorts were too tight and small for me. I am 6ft 252lbs.
2.0,Okay but I wasn’t crazy about the fit or the material.
2.0,"Fell apart after a day at the beach.  The metallic thread started  coming out.  Only places a beach towel, a brush,  and cell phone in it."
2.0,"Cute dress if you only need it for one time. The fabric is absolute junk already pilled up within the second washing. I have had to turn this into a nightgown. It's too bad the cut is nice, but the fabric is horrible"
2.0,"Not as expected, wouldn’t stay in one size, kept getting bigger."
2.0,The XL fits like a small
2.0,Very lightweight.  Don't believe them to be well made.  Plan to send back.
2.0,They’re MUCH cheaper quality and cheaper looking than what I expected. I remember the ones in the 80s being far nicer. I would have paid more for better quality. I hope this manufacturer considers making this much better.
2.0,Was not the length stated
2.0,The elastic came off on 3 pairs. The stiching is coming lose on them also . They are comfortable to wear but they are  made with poor quality and cheap materials.
2.0,It start to peel on the inside after a few month. Not happy with this product.
2.0,"Poor quality, tore in zipper area first time I wore it. Returned it."
2.0,"Beautiful small design, exactly what I was looking for.  But low rating because they will not open. Used some tools to try and still un successful."
2.0,I like the style and the size of it but quality is very low and looks very cheap. Also leather has a horrible smell so I just returned it back.
2.0,"I didn't expect this skirt to be as full or as long as the picture for the price, and it wasn't, of course. BUT, the main reason I returned it is the white skirt has a black waistband. Maybe that's not a deal-breaker for everyone, but it was for me because I wanted to tuck my shirt in. I'm 5'7"" and it was a midi skirt on me, about 2 inches below the knee."
2.0,The flares are very large so the sizing is off. The deathly hallows symbol gets a very weird greenish film on it if you get them wet. Very hard to clean.
2.0,It was a nice article of clothing but way too small for me.  I ordered a large which is usually sufficient.  I returned it and was given a refund.  Thanks.
2.0,Not true to size. Have ordered these before and size was good. This time that was not the case.
2.0,Not for multiple uses feathers shed badly.
2.0,"I loved the print and the design looked very cute, however it didn't work for me.  I'm 5'9&#34; and though the size seemed proper (wasn't too tight), the top was far too short.  Also, for me the back was not flattering and it's really best for someone with no extra back fat!"
2.0,I really liked these at first but after wearing them to an intensive yoga class I could see the sweat discoloring my pants and it looked like I had peed myself. Very embarrassing. I don't know if all yoga pants that aren't black show this but I see others in the classes who don't have this problem. I got he charcoal color.
2.0,Absolutely beautiful boots!  I wish I could have kept them. They were a Christmas gift.<br />Too stiff for the price!  Would have taken months of wearing to break in!
2.0,It was really fun and pretty for about a week until the gold rubbed off. Also it’s very thin. But it was good while it lasted tbh you cannot expect much
2.0,"As mentioned, the size seems much larger than expected and even if I wanted it baggy, I couldn't get over the VERY cheap feel of the fabric."
2.0,"The sunglasses arrived wrapped well. They seemed nice enough, however, they were huge. I have purchased a few other sunglasses from Amazon and have been very pleased. These sunglasses were not only wide for my face but the size of the lenses were also very large vertically from cheeks to eyebrows. I sent them back as soon as I took them out and tried them on."
2.0,"The two stars are not for the pants themselves but for the sizing. I have a pair of these pants in a small that I got at Costco. When Costco stopped carrying them I was looking for a second pair so I ordered a small online. The ""small"" that came was at least 1 1/2 inches larger in the waist and legs when I lay my old pair over the new pair for comparison. Maybe they just mis-labled the pair?"
2.0,"Very thin material, did not wash well at all. I would not recommend these pants."
2.0,"I really didn’t like the necklace. The chain looks cheap. It should have better chain , therefore better value."
2.0,"They’re cute in theory. Maybe I just have the wrong thigh-to-waist ratio for these, but instead of looking like cute paper bag shorts, it looks like I’m walking around in a pair of crumply men’s boxers. At least they have pockets"
2.0,"Order my size but way to big, but very pretty!"
2.0,not as comfortable as my previous NB ones unfortunately ..
2.0,Nice material but cap is to small for an adult.
2.0,I was excited to buy this pair of shorts because of the low price and the zippered pockets. But one of the zippers went off track (split open) on the very first use of these shorts. Maybe this is a case of &#34;you get what you pay for&#34;.
2.0,"Overall, the jacket wasn’t terrible so I gave it two stars, but that might have been generous. The fit was off— I know this jacket is a slim fit,  but the arms seem disproportionately tight. I ordered the Khaki color—I included a side-by-side photo for comparison—and you can see the color I received is yellow, not tan/khaki like the stock photo. It’s a big hassle to return this jacket (you have to print your own label and take it to a UPS store, then wait til it gets all the way back to China and they receive it before you can get a refund, unlike other items where you can simply walk into a Kohls store and return it and get an instant refund). This jacket will be donated to charity and my search for an actual khaki-colored corduroy jacket will continue. I’m disappointed, to say the least."
2.0,Much smaller than advertised bought 2XL as gift but then they gave to to someone who is a small and it fit tight on them
2.0,"They were to tight for me to put on, I ended up ripping a couple of them trying to put them on."
2.0,Couldn't put it on.. Then I ended up losing one of the small balls on one end.. So now I can't use it at all.
2.0,"NO WARRANTY. Very disappointed in the quality of this band.  It snapped after owning for 40 days but probably only wearing 15-20 times.  It was very tight and uncomfortable.  The finish was dull, easily scratched, and mulled.  Was very difficult contacting the manufacturer.  Finally was able to tweet them after finding a link on their website.  A Johanna Ferguson did respond to my email and request further information.  I wrote her to inform her that Amazon was willing to refund my money, but I preferred a replacement since the price had multiplied.  She did not respond to my email.  It is curious when a manufacturer does not stand behind their own product.  Buyer beware."
2.0,Not the right size for me.<br />Smallllllll
2.0,"This fit kind of snug, and there was absolutely no built in bust support.  Maybe that's normal for this type of swimwear, but it was unexpected for me.<br />The pattern was cute and I liked the style, but I didn't want to have to wear an additional swim piece underneath to get the support I needed.<br />I returned it."
2.0,"The colors are good, but the inside edges have sharp square edges that make them very uncomfortable to wear for an extended time. I've turned them inside out and now it irritates my other fingers. I would not recommend this for daily wear."
2.0,"Like all the other reviews, this product is cheaply made and falls apart."
2.0,This does not fit on my wrist. Too Big.
2.0,These are easy to fasten one handed. Unfortunately the stars both face the same direction so I can only wear them on one side. Good quality.
2.0,Bought this product in my size but when it came is was too small
2.0,"I had way better expectations about this long-shirt / dress. I am picky about the  clothes I buy and from the picture I was expecting a nice long shirt I could wear with leggins.<br /><br />OK so, the shirt itself is VERY CHEAPLY MADE. One of those item you buy in a Chinese Shop... I don't know if there is any in America but In Italy there was.. and stuff like this you would buy for MAX 15 dollars.<br />$28.98 is a rip-off! Not worth that much, not for the quality! To me this was a VERY DISAPPOINTING purchase.<br /><br />THE SHIRT:<br />- The shirt is VERY THIN!<br />- It has no label inside (like every shirt normally has!) that tells you how to wash it or what the material is). The description says &#34;Cotton, Polyester&#34;... in what percentage?<br />- It is going to be too short for a dress, and also a little see-through between the legs. You definitely will have to wear this on pants or leggings.<br />- Unfortunately the shirt (at least the one I received) had horrible stitching all over, from top to bottom there was some thread sticking out or a color mismatch.... something you really don't want to see when wearing it.<br />- Forget the picture in the item description where you see a perfect fitting. This shirt has a straight cut and won't fit perfectly on your body... no matter how curved or not you are...<br /><br />THE COLORS at least are exactly like pictured, and even better in person.<br /><br />THE ONLY GOOD THING:<br />- The seller is very helpful and answers immediately to any email, questions, etc. This is very important and I appreciated the courtesy and how well my problem with the item was handled and solved. I would give 5 stars to the seller, but the item is simply not how it could/should be.<br /><br />Recommended ONLY if they put the price down... for almost 30 dollars you want a good shirt, good quality, good fit, good material, good stitching... which means, you want a good product, worth the money! And that is just not the case..."
2.0,I love the earrings but some were broken or glue melted off
2.0,"I bought the masks because they had a strap around the back that would take the pressure off the ear loops.  I was tired of having my ears look like Alfred E. Newman.  Unfortunately the ear loops themselves are very, very small and no matter how I situate the strap they still tug at my ears.  Very uncomfortable.<br />Otherwise they seem well made and attractive but unsuitable for my needs.  I’m not returning them since I’ve tried wearing them but they will reside at the bottom of my sock drawer."
2.0,Reminds me of a plastic garbage bag for yard waste. It is very low quality and not very insulated.
2.0,"THESE ARE NOT SWEATPANTS. No fleece lining. They are thin. I'll keep because they are cite and will be nice for the summer, but they will not work for colder winter temperatures. Very disappointed that so many companies are using the term sweatpants when they are thin joggers."
2.0,"Removing and inserting cards is difficult.  The elastic bands are way too tight to easily wrap around paper currency, i.e., a poor money clip."
2.0,Not made correctly
2.0,A little deception with this one .<br />The cover is plastic and was scratched already before arrival.<br />Dosent looks like to much quality as i expected ..<br />and i was surprised that it came from china ( My fault) .
2.0,The clasp was so flimsy I repeatedly had to find it as it would drop off of my wrist.  I have no idea where it is now as I don't know when it slipped off
2.0,Fast shipping. However it was not the color that was described in the picture. Very disappointed. I was wanting a tan like the picture but instead received a gray...
2.0,This was an adult size wrist band. Way too big for children.
2.0,"This dress what very ill fitting. It was too big in the arms and the torso and was super boxy in the the waste. I'm very ""athletic-y"" shaped, as in I'm straight up and down, so maybe it would be better on someone with more curves.<br /><br />Oh, and the material feels like it's from Halloween express. I give it 2 stars because it came on time."
2.0,My daughter loves it but the class that holds the wolf and moon to the chain is cheaply made and has had to be repaired multiple times in the week we have had it.<br />Beautiful design!
2.0,Constantly gets tangled
2.0,Saw this all over Instagram for 3x the price. Thought I was getting a steal but it took forever to be delivered and the quality was terrible. Returned
2.0,Uncomfortable angle
2.0,The print is more celestial/stars than mermaid.
2.0,This shirt was bleeds. I got a red shirt for my husband and just by sitting on top of other clothes lighter than the strawberry red it discolored the other clothes. Then it was rinsed.. and bled through the entire cycle and again on the top of the jeans when worn. Overall not a bad quality shirt but this 12$ shirt damaged some very expensive other clothes. I do not recommend!
2.0,"The belt is for a waist two inches smaller than stated. It also had an abundant seven holes in it, looked weird as result.<br />Otherwise, it would have been a suitable belt. Live and learn..."
2.0,"The very first day three out of the four broke. I am really disapointed because I couldn't even use them, they broke while I was putting them on to see how they look. I gave it two stars because the one left is good and nobody notices it when I put it on. However, I'm still mad that I bought four and just got to use one."
2.0,It's shear and not in a good way. The material feel very cheap and the pattern is not the same as the picture. The bottom is straight cut unlike the picture shows. Overall disappointed but I can hopefully use it for some scraps.
2.0,"The brightness  of the outfit is not as displayed in the image,  it's full but the fit is ok. My daughter is age 10 but tall and I bought her a size 12. It still looks ok but definitely not as expected."
2.0,It was a cute dress when I first got it... After two days of wearing the grommets started to fall out and all that are left are big holes... Don't buy!
2.0,"The red Austrian crystal butterfly is so large that it makes it super tacky. The chain is so long that it hangs down to my navel, although the chain is adjustable with jewelry tools, but who really wants to take the time to do that. The piece also came with two crystals broken off of the butterfly, they were still in the bag and could be glued back on, but again, who wants to deal with that. I'd pass on purchasing this item."
2.0,Nothing like the picture. Colors are dull. Tops is really big and bottom very small. Cheap material and came already ripped around the waist.
2.0,Received and was disappointed order was received late and most of the pieces were chopped.  Really received about half the order.
2.0,not impressed with material or fit. returned.
2.0,The thickness of the Revant lense is noticeably thinner than the original Oakley lenses. I was happy with the look though and the installation was easy because they did fit in the frame very well like the original. The lenses looked great in the mirror. The reason I returned them was the back glare that I could see while wearing them in cloudy situations as well as in bright daylight. I could see the reflection of my eyes and the reflection of the  frame in the reflection so bad that it was distracting.
2.0,Was too big. Ordered a small but it turned out to be more like a medium.
2.0,"The front of the jeans are very loose, I wear a large and the pant fit me but if I pull them up I’ll be in the water I’m only “5,9”"
2.0,Returned as it seem so bulky.  Like the other ones I ordered so much better.
2.0,It's very plastic and stiff. the shirt is awesome the decial....not so much.
2.0,Very pretty and cool but broke in about 4 hours of being on the bracelet
2.0,"I was looking for some smooth light-weight feeling boxers. These looked like the perfect deal. However, to get a waist that fits comfortably, you need to buy a size big. However, if you do that, you end up swimming in them. I even had a pair altered to bring them in a bit. However, since the material doesn't stretch at all that totally wrecked that pair. Would not recommend. Not sure who has a body shaped for them."
2.0,"[[VIDEOID:4b22a14850fec5c314d9340a1b4e5fff]] This spinny tardis necklace is very poor quality. The tardis won't spin, it gets stuck. There is no detail or attention to detail, the paint job is very poor with bubble spots throughout. The finish looks and feels very cheap."
2.0,Found better for much cheaper price and bigger.
2.0,"This set was supposed to be yellow, but is actually gold."
2.0,It's hideous. The fabric is gross. Don't waste your money.
2.0,"At first it was very nice BUT 6 Weeks later, the screen protector no longer sits close to the screen. It’s becoming unusable."
2.0,The top is adequate quality and fit.  But it is sold as a WHITE top and it's definitely NOT white.  It's more of a light beige or ivory. I have attached a picture; the top I bought is on the left with another top I already had on the right for comparison.
2.0,Shirt wasn't the same as pictured. Still worked out but disappointed...
2.0,"Stiff and itchy, not very stretchy. Does not bend or flow well."
2.0,"Very cheap material, and very lightweight. Was much smaller than I though it would be."
2.0,"I question whether these are real blublockers. They’re so cheaply made for $50 sunglasses it’s ridiculous. Very thin, cheap plastic. You could get better quality frames from Target for $10. They also don’t come with a real case or a cleansing cloth. Like at least send something better than a cheap sack for $50 sunglasses. Meh."
2.0,Marked XL fit like S
2.0,I received the item before expected. Everything look ok but some of them were squished and lost their round shape. The dark green clip is way smaller than the rest. I was unhappy with most of them. I wont be buying from Ema Jane anymore! I dont think it was worth my time and money!
2.0,Different size shoes! So disappointed 😔<br /><br />Update: I ordered again and got two of the right size shoes. They are holding up well with my toddler. Would purchase again. You can’t beat the price.
2.0,Smaller than it appears. It's ok.... would not buy anymore.
2.0,The pocket fabric is too thick and looks like extra hips.  You can also see the pockets through the dress
2.0,"I was so sure I would love this mask, but it doesn't stay up over my nose any better than all the others."
2.0,"the frilly material at the waist above the belt sticks out way more than pictured. Quite ugly, had to return"
2.0,"We bought this because we thought it was made of linen fabric. But when received it, we found it is cotton in a ‘linen weave”. Stop selling it as a linen garment."
2.0,I understand that they are  a random selection but it was not even close to what was pictured.<br />My children were very disappointed.
2.0,Too chunky so I returned. It looked almost costumey.
2.0,I am a true M. The M that i got was more like an XS. I am going to need to order an XL or larger to fit into this.<br />For me the M is too short also. Sleeves are 4 inches too short and it too short in overall length also.
2.0,"They do not look like the picture. I wanted the green ones but they sent me another color.<br /><br />Aldo they sent me another  pair of the same earrings, that was nice.<br /><br />See the picture and make your own choice."
2.0,My dads head is not huge. Was wayyyyyy too small.
2.0,"I saw this shirt, and ordered it for myself, in a Men's 2X (I might wear a Men's XL, at most). The shade of green looked beautiful in the photos, and I was all too eager to get it, looking at the fiber.<br /><br />Well, it doesn't look anything like that, once you get it<br /><br />The color is far off the, what I'd call, Luna Moth green, and is more of a Astroturf Green, so it''s  nothing like the soft, elegant shade that's shown. On top of that, while it didn't seem to be damaged when I first received it, I washed it before wearing it, and it came out of the wash (which only contained a 12 pack of cotton bandanas) with the shoulder seam on the right torn open, so not only is it not the shade shown, but it's not well made, either. I also felt that it looked like polyester, which is why I burned the edge of it. My mom has taught me - from her career as a seamstress, clothing designer, and sewing instructor - that natural fabrics will burn, and synthetics (at least polyester) will melt, which is why I thought I'd see what happened when I burned the edge. It DID actually burn, and left ash behind, so it is made of natural fibers, but the texture is smooth, and has a small, tight weave, but it looks nothing like linen, and questionably cotton, but the fiber reaction indicates that it is natural fibers. I'm just not at all happy with this shirt - runs small, color is misrepresented, poor construction.<br /><br />Look elsewhere. This one isn't it."
2.0,"I had a Color Me Beautiful analysis done many years ago.  I have treasured the color swatch folder from that appointment.  There is and was real value to the swatches which are REAL FABRIC PIECES.  The new swatch fan is a very poor imitation of paint swatches from a hardware store.  Paint swatches are matte finish.  This swatch fan is cardboard with a shiny glossy finish which reflects the light in the room, making the colors difficult to view.  This is an annoying presentation.  The very, very limited value of this swatch fan is that there are more shades included than were in my original folder."
2.0,"This arrived looking like the picture, except it HAS wires in it. The seams are also pretty bulky, giving my boobs a weird horizontal line that shows no matter how thick my shirt is. I can even see it with multiple layers on. Bummer because it fits great otherwise!"
2.0,"The socks a a Christmas gift for very dear friend that needs socks to sleep in.  I did not open the package but they appeared perfect and when squeezing the page they did feel soft.  Not really knowing, I truly can’t rate this purchase!"
2.0,"Not true to size. Runs very small. Bottoms are made of scratchy, non stretch material. Not comfortable at all. Would not recommend."
2.0,"I got these hoping they would be a great transition from my +1.0 and they're not strong enough. Even though it states 100% returns accepted Amazon says you can't return then, and the supplier replied to my e-mail that it needs to go through Amazon.  The colors are darker than shown and they're quite flimsy, but okay for casual use. The lenses are a bit more amber than I'd like too. If you're 100% sure you'll keep these then go for them, otherwise I'd go with another pair."
2.0,Size up on this jumper. I order d a small and it was snug and was uncomfortable to wear. There is no stretch or give and wrinkled easily . It looks great on photos but not so much on me :-/
2.0,"Returned - - The &#34;one size fits all&#34; didn't fit at all.<br />It uses a velcro adjustment that is not large enough to get it to fasten.<br /><br />If it were larger, I would be happy to have it."
2.0,"I am highly disappointed! I bought this pair of earrings that included a gift box,because I intended to gift them, and no such gift box came with it. I also read several reviews and each and every one of them said a free pair of earrings was included which I didn't receive. The earrings themselves are nice but not worth the money without gift box and second pair of earrings"
2.0,"I was looking forward to receiving this but it was not as pictured. I believe they make this sleeve to order and enlarge the photo each time they make it. The print on the sleeve I received is grainy and cropped closer. I like how the zippers go halfway down each side making it easier to put the Asus notebook in it. it will protect my 15.2&#34; computer fine. Arrived before the estimate of a month but took longer than other Amazon items, however, it did ship from China."
2.0,This is so cute and fit perfectly. However my daughter has only worn it twice and it ripped.
2.0,"When ordering this bra, go up in your band size; we ordered a 36 and should have ordered a 38 possible; I can pull the bra over but it is so tight I don't think I would want to lift weight in this bra. Also, you look like you are totally flat with this one if you order it in your regular size; the cup seems to be ok but since the band is tight it just doesn't fit right."
2.0,"Ordered Xxl (what I always wear). The waist band was way too large. The top half of the dress from the waist band to the neck line was way too short, causing the too large waist band to come half way up my breasts. The inside fabric along the neckline was too taut and my large breasts caused that lining to keep flipping out. This dress is simply not suitable for large breasts. The fabric felt nice though."
2.0,"Pretty necklace BUT mine arrived broken, luckily I was able to fix it myself. The metal is so fragile I wouldn't be surprise if it breaks again."
2.0,Dress looks nothing like the picture. Will work fine for a bathing suit cover up
2.0,The composition of the dress wasn't what I expected and the material is cheap.
2.0,So yes it's very comfortable and breathable but I don't like it for one reason. That reason is the face patterns doesn't fit or align with your face as shown in my picture. Obviously it's not made for covid.
2.0,"Its an okay fit but not what i expected. The brand on the collar is not ModChok, so the sizing is a little different. I bought another Shirt, same size but was branded ModChok on the collar and the same size fits perfectly."
2.0,"Feels good on the wrist. Only thing is I don’t know if it fading or if it picked up ink from somewhere. I hadn’t worn any jeans when I had this band on so not really sure. Also the spring kept coming undone while I had it on. It didn’t break, I was able to put it back together but it’s the fact that I had to a couple times."
2.0,"It's 100% synthetic. This feels like some dance costumes I've worn during high school. It is not at all what I would wear around town. It is opaque, fits well, and is stretchy, but considering this is essentially a dance costume w/out a gusset I' m not impressed by those attributes."
2.0,Doesn't seem to reach around the ear as shown in the picture. Kind of difficult for the tail to reach the top of ear as per the picture.
2.0,"I love the color and, like most women, love having a variety of colors.  I ordered them in the same size that I had ordered the black (2) pairs in but the grey ones are firmer and will not stretch to fit. Is there a larger size that I could exchange them for?"
2.0,"This is NOT a large yoga bag. In the photo, it shows the bag with a mat and two blocks in it with room to spare but I have no idea what they did to make it appear that is possible. It fits my yoga mat and close to no room for anything else. Blocks, change of clothes is not happening.  Apart from that, the bag is fine. The strap is adjustable and there is storage on the outside for phone etc. if you need lots of storage, do not buy. Disappointed. False advertising."
2.0,"The fit was all wrong. There was a gap in the back between my back and the shorts, yet they bunched up in the front like they were too small. Other than that, the length was good and the legs fit good, but I did return them for just not fitting right."
2.0,The shirt was well made with good materials. It looks cute in the picture but sadly  when I tried it on it looked like weird hospital scrubs and fit strangely. I didn't keep it.
2.0,Cute jacket but the color looks faded. I’m returning it.
2.0,"I had to return this item way too small, more of a child’s purse not for adults"
2.0,Again another bracelet that was produced with a very poor clasp. Too much fraying of the leather wraping. Extremly difficult to place and remove from your wrist.
2.0,"I  purchase this dress for a casual summer day look. Loved everything about it, except the smell!!!!!  The fabric had this awful, almost chemical smell. I called customer service and asked  them about, if I wash it and the smell is gone I would be happy to keep it, otherwise I would be returning it. Laundered as usual, the smell is still there. I believe it was something in the fabric being that it’s made overseas, one can never tell. Love the dress I would never order from this brand though. I did purchase another very similar dress absolutely love it,  different brand, which washed well over the past several months and I plan to order more of those. Wish they would’ve use better fabric and this one I would have purchased several more."
2.0,Not very form fitting
2.0,"So much potential, such a disappointment. This dress came with beautiful stitch work, the sequins were gorgeous and the materials were pretty okay. Not quite what I expected, it was more of a sheer material, and I thought it would be a Faux silk type texture. But none the less it was decent looking right out of the package. Until I put it on and realized it was made for a human with NO shape. It’s like the whole this was stitched straight down. It hung strangely in all the wrong places. Granted I don’t have big hips, or a big bust, but I have SOME shape...and this dress did not! It was like putting on a sparkly bag!"
2.0,"The pineapple sticker is nice and thick. The shirt material is what I didn’t like, the photo shows a regular T-shirt. I wanted a loose shirt, this is not it. The material is nice but not what I was looking fwd too. I will be returning it."
2.0,Didn't look as expected
2.0,"The fabric was nice and soft. The fit was huge. I’m 5’2 tall and it was just way too wide, long & overall huge"
2.0,I adored these shoes. They are definitely not made of the best material but I still liked them. Unfortunately they broke beyond repair the SECOND time I wore them. :(
2.0,This is a beautiful necklace but it came broken unhinged in the middle. It was packaged well so not sure how it was broken upon delivery.
2.0,It's hot and not big enough
2.0,Misleqding. No boy outfit only girls
2.0,Supposed to be 1 smiling and one frowning. Received two of the same.
2.0,Material is very thick. NOT for the summer. Looks like it has already been washed a few times. Looks faded. But it fits well.
2.0,Pajamas now!
2.0,Keychain was not worth 8 dollars it was worth 3 dollars at the most
2.0,"I loved the ring, I thought would be good quality. One day I was taking it off and it just broke in half."
2.0,Much bigger then I wanted
2.0,"Product was too small, and the fabric does not move with your body."
2.0,"The color is pretty and it's very small and delicate-looking, but practically this is not easy to wear, because the necklace is so short that the triangle hits right at my clavicle and sticks out at an angle.  The chain is thin and kinks easily.  I'm considering getting another chain to put the charm on, but it's pretty expensive for just the charm."
2.0,Cute enough.
2.0,"the item description says &#34;one size fits most&#34;...I wear an average adult woman's size (7)....the teal with the cheetah-type spots is a bit tight, but are okay....the blue floral are impossible to put on...they are almost child size...."
2.0,"This one piece is really cute,  the material is real soft,  and lightweight.  However the leg portion is really short,  like come above my ankles short."
2.0,Basically a crop top...super short
2.0,"I carefully checked the photos to get the higher quality Buckle assembly. However, the Buckle received was a cheaper device made from very thin metal and does not have the appearance of the one shown in the picture. The belt material is thin and synthetic; not the robust canvas to which I am accustomed. Disappointing."
2.0,good quality material but is definitely not true to size.
2.0,"This company needs to look at their sizing chart. The size was supposed to be a women's medium. It was more like a girl's medium. The style and quality seemed okay, but the sizing was way off. I am sending it back."
2.0,This hat is poorly constructed. There is a big fold at the top of the hat face. The face also stands really high. The side stitching is poor.  Be careful which companies you are buying from. I forgot to check and now I regret it.
2.0,Item was well received. One of the ears look larger than the other. Not sure if it was because it's handmade or there's something wrong with the mould? Eyes did not look as lively as they were on the photo.
2.0,"These were cute, but they started to fall apart after the second wear by my 11mo (not yet walking)"
2.0,"The waistline of this dress does not fall on the waist for anyone with any significant bust. In addition to this dress being a very loose fit all over, it fit more like an empire top with the waistline just below my breasts. It did nothing for my figure. Disappointing because the fabric is very comfortable and soft."
2.0,The top is see through you will need a tank under it. It runs small.The slight was sewn inside off so the tags and the seam of the slip are on the outside but the top layer of chiffon covers that. The bottom half is also very see through. Will mostly likely need another slip to wear underneath.
2.0,Looks nice on but is difficult to keep positioned as the &#34;underslip&#34; type fabric keeps making an appearance in the front area.
2.0,"The sweater was smaller and shorter than expected.  I am 5'5"" and 120 pounds and always wear a small, but this sweater pulled open when I tried to button it.  the sweater also came just below my bottom vs to the knees like shown in the picture.  Lastly, the shoulder seams were weirdly down 6 inches on my arms.  I tried to return it but the supplier only refunded me 50%.  I would not buy this sweater....."
2.0,"Made me look like a fat, shapeless blob. Needless to say, I sent it back.  If you have a thin, straight figure, this will probably look nice on you.  If you have any hips or curves, it will likely accentuate them in the worst way.  I will say the color was nice though (bluish gray)"
2.0,I will not order from this company again. I ordered this dress in black and it look different from the picture. Material was thin.
2.0,We're going to use it for our 6.00 pizza Friday 🍕 At Canaan Maine Circle K ... and stand out by the road and attract customers 😋 should be fun
2.0,"We are thinking of returning the watch.  While the watch looks nice, the package did not contain the tool, instructions and extra links that were to be included in the purchase.  We will have to take it to a jeweler to shorten it; hopefully the jeweler will be able to shorten it."
2.0,These vest extenders are cheaply made and they won’t stay snapped on my vest.  Definitely not worth the money.
2.0,"Quality isn't that great. Where the bow is yoy can see the hot glue thar was used to attach bow. The bow isn't exactly like the bow pictured either.  My hat has just the bow part, no ribbon under the bow so it looks like the bow is too small for the Hat. They ship it all folded up as well and the creases do not come out...."
2.0,"I loved the dress online but when I received it, it was way shorter than I expected. I am short, 5'2 so I figured I would have a little extra length. I decided to wear it with leggings or a skirt and it will work."
2.0,"Returned and bought a cheaper, knock off brand that fit way better."
2.0,"I didn’t think something could be both too big and too small at the same time. I’m a 36DD/F. The extra large was both too big around my ribs, and too small in the cups... I was really hoping it’d fit because it was otherwise well made and pretty."
2.0,"It's a bit tight in the chest and was way too short on me.  I am 5'11&#34;, 38D. Due to the length, it fell in a very awkward way on me."
2.0,The photo color looks beige/soft tan but in reality it has a pink tone to the pants. The pants are very very small. I had to get a refund which stinks because I did love the pants.
2.0,These are far from 2 inch rocks. There is one that’s a decent size the rest are luck if they are an inch-inch and a quarter.
2.0,"Glasses are nice but for the price, I've received better glasses with case and cleaning cloth and all."
2.0,Only about half on the bracelets I liked. They were stiff and uncomfortable to wear at first.
2.0,No me agrada el tamal lo estuvo pequeño
2.0,Much smaller than expected and much smaller than most key holders
2.0,Shirt was cute but I ordered but I ordered my regular size and it was way too small.
2.0,"""stretch to fit"" is not an honest description.  I will give these to my 7 year-old granddaughter, for whom they should be usable until she's maybe 12 years old, as she has a petite build.  I will not order from this seller again.  If they fit they would be nice as the weave is attractive and they are soft."
2.0,"This came all balled up with plastic tubing that will not open up, so it actually sits like it's supposed to.  Also, there were no chopsticks included despite not saying that anywhere on the package."
2.0,"Product is great, except the little claws that attach to the shirt fell off after my second use. It broke while I was outside, and I did not notice until I returned home."
2.0,"The material is horrible, not exactly what I was hoping for."
2.0,No way to secure the earrings on you. I lost one side on the first day. Now I only have 1 side left.
2.0,I am not happy withe these slippers. I returned them. They are well made and look good.<br />  They have very little arch and just plain don't feel good on my feet.  If you need a high arch support. These are not the answer.<br /> Update: I ordered Vionic from Amazon and they are wonderful with a high arch. Look good feel good very happy.
2.0,First the compass itself fell out of the case. No biggie because I saw it roll across the floor in my kitchen. Now all the numbers on the bezel are coming off like flaking..
2.0,La calidad de la tela es mala.
2.0,Not crazy about how it feels.
2.0,"I don't know why everyone keeps saying these aren't see through. I don't even need to try them on to tell that the second I do any type of stretching in these that you will be able to see my butt through these. I have some of the leggings that I got from tj maxx and those ones are wonderful!! These however, aren't. And they seem to be a different material."
2.0,You definitely need to size up or you will waste your money. I purchased an xl. I should have got an 3xl.<br />Xl doesn't even cover half my chest.<br />Disappointing to waste money.
2.0,I ordered my size based on the chart & the cup size was way too small. This bra is not sized well for larger cup sizes.
2.0,Look great but the bar to go in your earlobe is difficult to line up with the hole without bending the bar and that won't last long.
2.0,"First of all, I should point out that I am not a believer in the value of RFID-blocking qualities.  I understand the technology exists, but I am not convinced that it is a threat any more than I am afraid of getting struck by lightening, so that particular quality is not a factor at all.  I simply wanted a compact way to carry my credit cards, cash, etc.  I was intrigued by The Ridge wallet, and hoped this would be a more affordable alternative.  The pictures to me looked like a glorified rubber band around two pieces of decorative plastic, but the reviews were good, so I decided to give it a try.<br /><br />My assessment: It's a glorified rubber band around two pieces of decorative plastic (technically carbon fiber, apparently, for whatever that's worth).<br /><br />My items were not secure in the wallet at all.  I would reach into my pocket for it and pull it out and the cards would at times be half way out of the wallet.  In a bigger loose pocket, like the front pocket of a ski jacket, I suspect your cards would fall out and you'll have a pocket full of loose items.  If you drop it, items will fall out.<br /><br />It's clearly working for a lot of people, but I don't get it.  It does almost nothing for me.  Who knows? I'm going to try the Ridge Wallet after all and maybe I'll find it to be just as unfulfilling.  I'll let you know."
2.0,not sure what it was but just didn't work
2.0,I usually wear about 10 -12.....paid attention to the commentary and ordered a size up....'large'....it fit but was lost form fitting.....I thought that once washed this would be far too small......returned
2.0,look like girl jeans
2.0,"The only thing I liked was the price. This item must have changed since 2018 because those reviews were good. Sorry to say, the material is thin and there is no elasticity in the waistband. Also, they are not true compression shorts. The length is fine but the material itself is pretty thin. More like biker shorts."
2.0,The material is cheap and they don’t stay up well as a face mask. I will purchase a different brand
2.0,Too tiny!! Looks like a child's ring..
2.0,"Super cute style but after 5 wears, maybe 3 washes the stitching is coming undone."
2.0,"Love the Color.  I ordered several sizes, but none of them fit.  I ordered another dress in a different color, same style and it fit in my normal size."
2.0,A little too long!
2.0,"I bought this shirt because in the photo, it appears that it curves with how a woman is made. I thought the shirt would fit to my hips and chest, but taper in towards my waist. However, the actual shirt is made in a more box-like shape standard to most unisex t-shirts. The size was right and fit just like any other t-shirt would, but that wasn't the fit that I was looking for. I returned it."
2.0,"Cute top, but the bottoms didn't match the top. Different pattern completely. Looks mismatched."
2.0,The leather ends make it difficult to get this belt through the beltloops on toddler pants. They are too big and firm leather. They seem well-made but we can't use them yet. My toddler wears a size 18mos. We will save them for bigger pants.
2.0,"I had to return this one because it was cut… looked like someone took scissors and slit the side. The fit was great, smelled like smoke much like all these dresses. Makes the &#34;company&#34; appear unprofessional. I liked it, wish it wasn't damaged."
2.0,Haven't been able to use it.  The circle where the arrow go it got loose from the chain.  The bigger arrow was completely loose from the chain.
2.0,Too clingy and close fitting material. Doesn't drape right.
2.0,"For the price of this jacket, the teeth on the zipper should last a little longer than a month and a half. 4 teeth on the zipper at the very bottom. Can't zip up."
2.0,What you get here is a brown stained strap that someone ran a straight wipe down with a rag or sponge. That is about the extent of time taken to make the band look aged or cool. Looks like someone did it in 5th grade art class.
2.0,"My daughter was so excited to get this dress, but when it came she was disappointed and won't even wear it.  The material is so thin; it is more of a Halloween costume material.  There is no hem, only stitching sewn around the outside edges.  Very disappointed."
2.0,"My husband has a strong preference for full-zip hoodies rather than quarter-zip or pullovers, so I’m always on the lookout.  He also spends a lot of time working outdoors in all seasons here in Maine and likes to wear a hoodie or jacket that is warm but also flexible, especially one that allows him to fully flex and swing his arms around.<br /><br />I wouldn’t call this “super heavyweight.”  It’s not as thick and heavy as a Dickies or Carhartt work sweatshirt, for example.  But it’s mid- to heavyweight and comfortably warm in these cool fall temperatures in Maine.<br /><br />This hoodie fits true to size, with room enough to wear a flannel shirt or even a sweater underneath.  My husband is 5’10” and has average-length sleeves.  These sleeves are very slightly long on him, but stay at his wrists because of the ribbing.  This snug ribbing also makes sure cold breezes don’t go up the arms.  The hoodie is long enough to ensure he doesn’t expose skin when he reaches all the way up overhead.<br /><br />The hood is double-thick material.  It also has a sort of turtleneck where the laces are, so that if you tie the laces, even with the hood down, you can keep your neck warm.  This is very similar to the way hoods are on Carhartt sweatshirts.<br /><br />The fabric blend of 80% cotton and 20% polyester is smooth and comfortable.  The fleece inside layer doesn’t have that fake plasticky feel that some fleeces do.  It doesn’t shrink or pill in a warm water wash and warm dryer.<br /><br />There are a couple of things I don’t like, and one is serious enough that I would not buy this.  If you take a closeup look at the pictures on the product page, maybe you can see that the top horizontal edge on the pockets is a raw, unfinished edge. The same is true of the ribbing on the sleeves and at the bottom of the garment.  Weirdly, it is the inside that is finished.  I don’t know if this was intentional or not, but it’s bad.  When you wash the garment, you get loads of loose threads along these unfinished edges that you have to cut off, and the unfinished edges look more and more rough and raggedy.<br /><br />My other issue is that I really dislike the logo tag—with wear instructions—sewn on the outside of the left pocket.  Come on guys, who the heck wants to wear what clearly should be an internal tag on the outside?  I carefully picked it off with a seam ripper.<br /><br />My husband likes the hoodie other than this unraveling issue, but he agrees that he would not have wanted to pay full price for a sweatshirt with this unfinished edge/unraveling issue."
2.0,The bracelet  tarnished ! ! Will never buy cheap jewelry  again I guess  you get what you pay for ...
2.0,"I love the look of this necklace, but it's not very good quality and my neck breaks out in a rash every time I wear it. :( I don't usually have this problem with cheap jewelry, so who knows what it's made of."
2.0,"Zipper broke on one glove first time wearing, both pairs. They also run small, so I'd recommend ordering one size up"
2.0,"It's cute and useful if you need it while stretching or to hold you hair back while washing your face but for a workout it is not good.  Less than 10 minutes into my HITT workout, the headband had fallen off."
2.0,Garment fit smaller than expected and did not have any stretch/give. Otherwise color / photo was consistent with the item in person.
2.0,Big on size
2.0,Not at all what I thought it would be..
2.0,Not as pictured!  Look and feel cheap as if purchased at a flea market.  They were purchased as a Christmas gift and not preseted due to quality.  Returning to Amazon.
2.0,The screwdriver broke with in a week of having it on my keychain. Then the eyeglass case started to come apart after a few weeks.
2.0,"Make sure you find this somewhere and see it in person before you buy.  I researched diligently to replace my existing market umbrella, which I have had for years and is a very high quality piece.  This Galtech appears to be equivalent and is an excellent price.  Reviews elsewhere all raved about it, so I bought it.  It arrived and I was very disappointed in the quality.  It is light weight and plastic-y.  The fabric is thinner and less sturdy than my current umbrella.  It has a plastic top piece!  How cheap.  It is rickety and feels like a stiff breeze would splinter it.  The orange fabric is also garish and too bright (samples were unavailable...).  I went to return it, which they allow, BUT YOU MUST PAY RETURN SHIPPING, which is MINIMUM $55 at USPS and more at UPS and FEDEX.  SERIOUSLY?  This makes it essentially unreturnable.  I am stuck with this piece of junk.  BUYER BEWARE."
2.0,Not the quality I was expecting no disrespect to the company
2.0,Zippers broke immediately.
2.0,"So I got this and realized the shirt was a weird synthetic type material. I tried it on anyway (with the shorts) and the shirt is not nearly long enough! I don’t know about you, but if I lift my arms, I don’t want my entire stomach to show. The shorts fit perfects and are great which is the only reason this is getting two stars. The shirt is so bad I’m cutting it up for rags, like there’s no way it’ll fit. For reference, I’m 4’10. Most shirts swallow me. The shirt fit fine, it just wasn’t long enough."
2.0,"One layer, VERY thin and closer to child size."
2.0,"It's cute, but I wore it twice before one of the stones broke off. So for the price, I guess it was worth it?"
2.0,definitely was not what i wanted or thought i was getting.
2.0,"I love the color, the fabric is soft but what ruins this is the extremely itchy and impossible to remove tag. It's horrible and ruins the nightgown. I'd send it back but it's too much trouble."
2.0,Beautiful watch. Genuine leather. Stopped working after 4 months
2.0,Sorry but this was nothing like the picture...the model looks like she has pleats on either side of the stripe feature....but it is an optical illusion.<br />The dress is like a shift with the stripe feature down the center.  You have to put your hands in the pockets and twirl to get it to look like the pic.  Very deceiving. Sent it back.
2.0,"The socks are cute, and the size is just fine. But they don't stretch when you're pulling them on. I keep hearing a tearing noise when I try to pull them over my heel as gently as possible. Pretty sure they're going to fall apart quickly."
2.0,"The mother suit is extremely big the kid suit is perfect. The quality of the goods is very good, but unfortunately the size is incorrect"
2.0,"Much too small, I ordered a medium and a large. The large was really snug, it fit but left nothing to the imagination and I typically wear a medium. It's very very low cut the top of my bra was showing so I'm not sure how you'd wear this with a typical bra. Returning for similar style from same brand. Color is as pictured and I liked the arms, they were not too tight."
2.0,"Looks cheap, can't remember what I paid for it but it's still in my closet.  I would not purchase it again but eventually I will wear to work.  It's not the best quality but it's not the worse...It's Meh"
2.0,"The studs are beautiful, but they didn't have the ball on the end so it falls right out. The whole pack was like this. I had to order backs for them so they would stay on."
2.0,"I don't know who can fit into these pair of shorts that I bought at Amazon.  Even if they fit like a glove I would have another problem with them and that's enough coverage with the jeans!  I appreciate new styles, and that includes the ripped jeans/shorts. However like everything else, there's a nice way of designing something, and then there's ""going overboard"" so to speak. I feel like the shorts are ripped from the bottom, all the way into the front pockets! 'Well, If it makes you happy.<br /><br />True story:  I gave the tiny white pair of shorts to my 10 yr. old neighbor. Perfect fit! lol Those were Woman's Medium. I came back and ordered a Large. They came in time with more rips than I could imagine! lol. But they fit so much better!  Another thing I noticed with this brand of jean shorts was that the zipper is of the cheapest quality.  However the biggest thing to remember is to go a size up...."
2.0,Beautiful piece but it is too heavy yo wear all night. Ouchie
2.0,This shirt had a great cut. It ran a little big. The material was not at all as I had expected. It was a slick material and very thin. I returned it immediately.
2.0,Too small.  Wallet won't fit inside it.
2.0,Runs very small. I sent it baCk
2.0,Quartz should be clear but this item was milky white. I returned it.
2.0,"I recently purchased these for my son. At first they were good. Comfortable, and nice style. But after about 3 weeks his heel burned a hole through most of the padding on the inside and the rubber is coming off. I would not purchase these again."
2.0,I love this product and nice color as well
2.0,Great material great color but there's no way that the top chest coverage works not enough material to overlap which is unfortunate
2.0,"Incredibly cheap material. Should have tried them out inside first before wearing so i could return them. Cute and with a memory foam sole, but they aren't supportive and will absolutely not last."
2.0,Should have looked at the dimensions of the earrings - they are sooo small hard to even notice the tassel
2.0,Watch is brown and not black!! I needed black.
2.0,"The heel fell off after two times wearing.  Worst part is, my daughter was walking down the stairs when it happened, and fell from nearly the top! For $50, I expect a good quality shoe that won't fall apart the second time it's worn."
2.0,Cheap fabric. Stiff feeling. I normally wear a small or medium and even the large is too small. Arms are really tight. Cute style. Just needs to be made better. Wanted to ship back but would cost me half of what I paid for the item.
2.0,Looks okay. Does not appear to be genuine leather as advertised. There is no stamping that says genuine leather compared to other ones I’ve purchased on Amazon.
2.0,This is way too big. I actually bought it for a lounging sleep shirt and it is huge. It's more like a men's size shirt.
2.0,Ordered XL but fits more like a small so unwearable for me
2.0,It is a pretty shirt. I just wish when the say large it's a large. Maybe my 10 yr old niece could for into this large. It's like a child's large.
2.0,"it hurt my daughters head to wear it for more that 2 minutes. She didn't go for it. I wanted to return it but I had to pay the shipping on this item and by the time all the hassle and expense of returning this product was done, it just wasn't worth it."
2.0,"Love the feel, love the look but every single pair continued to get loose and the lost a a screw and fell apart. wouldn't buy again"
2.0,"Be wary, it fits wrist that are at max 6.5-7 inches around. They are very beautiful in color how ever they come off very easily. I don't know how many times I have almost lost one of these since in the past couple of day since I began wearing one of the watches."
2.0,I do not like the clour defrent than the picture and size it is very small
2.0,"I was very disappointed with the item. I was shocked at how it didn't fit around the outside of my ear, it disappeared in my ear, and there was no cuff to attach it to my ear even if it was bigger. Sorry, very disappointing indeed, I hate to say. :("
2.0,I thought these were so cute and seemed good quality. But the velcro stopped sticking within 2-3 weeks of wearing. Really disappointed
2.0,I've had the belt now since February and it's falling apart already.  The leather is breaking apart on the back side.
2.0,This brooch is very large. It's pretty. I'm sending it back because the class was loose and it won't stay on.
2.0,"First thing I noticed when I took these out of the package was that one ear stem was higher than the other.  I put it on and it sat crooked on my face.<br /><br />I tried to bend the frame and make it straight and even but it didn’t work.  Not only that, these felt very cheaply made.  The lens was very thin and felt like it would scratch and break the first time it was dropped.<br /><br />I returned these the same day.  Stay away."
2.0,"I don’t mind the shorts. What I expected. However, I ordered the blue with the white trim and received the blue with the black trim. Not what was pictured."
2.0,"Solamente duraron una semana intactatos  ,las puntas se rompen .. son lindo pero se quiebran"
2.0,I bought it on impulse and it didn't work. I get quick reply on an exchange but I'm too lazy to send it back.
2.0,"As an OIF Veteran, I feel that it is necessary to point out that this product is made in China."
2.0,"Purchased this as a gift and when putting it in the gift box, I realized the top was squishing the bracelet down causing it to warp slightly. Too bendable for my taste. And the clasp to put it on & take off is difficult to do."
2.0,It was really cute but wayyyyy to small. Unfortunately had to return it. Totally bummed
2.0,The hat and shirt are wonderful but the shorts are sewn incorrectly. The one-sided inside lining is sewn to the front on one leg and the back on the other. This means you can only put one leg in.
2.0,Muy daughter uses 2 times and one shoe is not working anymore. The quality of the shoes seems nice but the electronic circuit si not good.
2.0,The watch is ok. Came well packaged and not damaged. But there is a blatantly obvious error on the dial. When looking at the military hours it goes from 20-21-20-23. Someone messed up and there is no 22. My son (12) doesn’t seem to care and doesn’t want to send it back. I think that’s a pretty dumb error to have and simple quality control could have found it.
2.0,Initially look and feel is great. But a major problem is with the comfort level. The nose starts paining in few minutes you start to wear it. It serves the purpose of outdoor play under the sun. But not for longer times. Overall an okayish product but dissapointed.
2.0,"I didn’t like the fabric, it was slightly shiny and the print Looked very cheap. I didn’t like it and sent it back."
2.0,It was nice while it lasted but broke very quickly. :(
2.0,"They're comfortable ankle warmers, but beyond that they do not have enough compression in them to alleviate the pain/swelling."
2.0,The top did not fit right on my body. It gaped at the back opening.
2.0,This product is not what I expected itof a waxy substance would not buy again
2.0,the material is very thick and not very flattering. I am not a huge fan of the tighness around the bottom of the sleeves either
2.0,"Cheap metal, very light weight. Small circumference so if your nose piercing is higher up on your nose, there's a good chance it will not fit."
2.0,I would not recommend.  Colors are not bright.
2.0,They feel really nice and are very comfortable but they run very small. I would suggested getting a size bigger than you normally do.
2.0,These a great deal. I have lots to choose from now. They do make my ear a little sore when I wear headphones. I use for my daith.<br />Update: they make your ear Soooo sore after wearing for awhile. Definitely not something you can put in and just leave.
2.0,The bear is big... and ring way too tight. Left big whelp/swelling/ball/bead marks.. turning light blue.. glad I was watching. She is 3 and had on little finger.
2.0,Find the skirts very thin...almost see through.
2.0,"The jersey and shorts look nice, they're just way too big for my son. I believe somebody messed up with the size when shipping."
2.0,This ban is almost impossible to fasten to your wrist.. You have to have someone else put it on you and take it off. Very disappointed..
2.0,Was over sized and bottom of dress proofed out
2.0,"I was really excited when I saw this top, so naturally I had to order it. The mesh/lace pattern around the neck was what caught my eye. Unfortunately, the top was suuuuuper small and I could  not get it over my boobs. I doubled checked the size on the top it self and on the product page to make sure I had ordered the right size and I did, but these tops, I guess run so super small and definitely do not take into consideration the more busty women. So, this was given to my niece instead. Happy she loved it, but sad it didn't fit properly for me."
2.0,Felt like a felt sweater that my daughter made in art class. Returned.
2.0,"The length and quality were great. The v neck did not lay across the chest, it came up to my shoulder. Would have kept otherwise"
2.0,"While these work well as compression gloves, these have left black stains on almost everything I’ve touched while wearing them. Even though I washed them twice before wearing them, the black dye has bled onto my sheets, pillowcases, heating pad, etc and it’s not coming out. I would not recommend buying these."
2.0,It broke in less than week
2.0,The top ot the bottle connected to the ring broke in 2 days
2.0,I purchased this hat in May to use for this summer pool season. I’m very fair complected so I wanted a hat with a wide brim when I first got the hat I thought it looked great nice appliable this is going to be perfect and the price seem good to you however I probably wear this hat three or four times a week when I’m out in the sun or at the pool.  I was wearing the hat at a local waterpark and while I was there the hat came apart. It basically lasted two months. But now it’s garbage. So I would say if you just want to hat to wear occasionally that looks good and does the job this would be a great purchase but if you’re going to wear it more regularly like I did this summer it’s not worth it.
2.0,This shrinks badly when washed (and air dried on a rack)
2.0,Right foot was not made very well Left foot was better quality than right foot right foot zipper wouldn't stay zipped.
2.0,"Look nice on the Amazon website, but they are microscopic in size. I returned them."
2.0,Sizes inaccurate.
2.0,Material peels immediately
2.0,To thin and to small
2.0,"I asked for 6 1/2 bu it felt like a 7 1/2 or 8. Very big. Since they came from over seas, it would cost too much to return."
2.0,"These pants run very small. I would say size two sizes up, not just one. The fabric is soft, that is only plus."
2.0,"Wish this came in a size small, it's not quite a curved through the body as depicted.  The photo appears to be a bit more narrow than in reality, as it fit in a more boxy manner that I expected based upon the photo  -  too bad because it's cute material."
2.0,Cheap quality. Much shorter than on the picture!
2.0,"Print on sweater was not in English, made no sense at all. Liked style material, fit well.  Unfortunately they couldn't put in English!"
2.0,"The nose bridge breaks to easy, the Velcro wears out to fast. Love the look & feel. Would be better if the filter covered more & the vents were there only to hold the filter & not let air in. Also the vents fall off toooooooo easy so actually a better & more effective way to hold the filters to the mask."
2.0,"I wear a 2 xl I. Women and 1 xl in men and this is too small for me, I bought for a 2xl  man but it doesn't even fit me. This is China size not us size XL I would need a 4or 5xl on this and I wear us size 1xl men and 2 xl women...very dissapointed"
2.0,It fits awkwardly
2.0,"They are cute, but they hurt my ears. Also turned my ears green, after wearing them 1 day at work? Never had that happen before. Same with both of my daughters."
2.0,I bought these for my 1 1/2 year old and couldn't get them on. The thumb holes are extremely tiny. Very disappointed.
2.0,"Good price but not everyone in the USA is fat, some of us just want clothes to be the size they say they are. These run Big!"
2.0,"The designs are fun, but the quality is noticeably less than the Happy Socks brand.  In addition, the sock fit very low on the leg, causing the need to pull them up when necessary."
2.0,"I have bought at least 5 sets of snowflake ear rings for the ladies in my life off Amazon.  There's not a lot of bling with these.  There are so many different snowflake ear rings to be viewed on Amazon, keep looking, don't get these, their not very pretty."
2.0,I foolishly tried to wear this as a nipple ring. Way too heavy. Tore me right up.<br />The skull is kind of hard to pop in there.
2.0,"This is the must uncomfortable bra I've ever worn.<br /><br />As promised, it doesn't move. But something about the binding/seams dug into my left side so tightly that it left a red mark.<br /><br />Could only wear it for 4 minutes before having to take it off. Promptly returned."
2.0,The zipper handle was missing when I got the item and there is a hole in the seam of the stitching.
2.0,Was WAY too long and poorly hemmed. Not sure if it was the color (peachy one)  or luck of the draw as another color (navy floral) in the same size was perfect
2.0,"Old material, the fit is super uncomfortable"
2.0,"Not well made, they went to the garbage"
2.0,Great looking but too fragile.
2.0,This is much prettier in the picture and didn't fir true to size. I was looking for something with more of a linen feel. I sent mine back and the return went just fine.
2.0,"Great fit and super soft but the material flakes off on everything! My shirt was covered in black lint, my Jean's as well."
2.0,One tenis shoe stop working after 2 weeks .
2.0,The bottom fit perfect but the top was way too small
2.0,Material feels weird like a shower curtain and it for way too small
2.0,Cheap material for theprice
2.0,They are really cute but the plating came off and got stuck in my piercing hole. My ear got inflamed and took 6 days to push out the metal flake.
2.0,"I very much like the look of the watch and it is very comfortable  however, one of the links has broken after just 4 months.  I do not  wear the watch every day maybe 3 days a week.  It appears as though where the links are put together it is weak and does not withstand light use."
2.0,"The product is adorable as a red panda. It’s sturdy enough but unfortunately came defective - it did not include a chain to hang the key. I got a few others from this company that both did or didn’t have chains, so annoyingly I’ve had to leave two covers off of my keys and will be returning them. If yours comes with the chain, definitely worth it!"
2.0,The shoes are nice looking and long enough but they hurt my feet.  I have a normal width foot and these pinch my toes and cause blisters.  disappointed.
2.0,I bought the dress to wear to theme parks since I live 20 mins from Disney. The dress is cute but the built in bra didn't really do much. I had to wear a sports bra under it. Also after about 5mins of walking the dress part rides up and you see the shorts under it.
2.0,The buckle does not release from the belt with out some difficulty!
2.0,Not enough support; runs small
2.0,I got this for my girlfriend we went to the store so she can try it out. She took a step off a curb and the chain snapped.
2.0,wrong colors - 4M and 1 LG for some reason - first wash - the hem came out of one and the binding around the neck on an other separated so there's a hole - not happy - waste of money
2.0,"This fit fine but was by no means high waisted.  It came just above my hips, provided zero coverage for the tummy."
2.0,A little flimsy for shades at this price point.
2.0,"Weird fabric, slightly uncomfortable. But it had pockets!"
2.0,Was a gift for a friend. Red paint on bow chipped off before I could even give it yoo her.
2.0,Too BIG!!!
2.0,"Shippig was long, missed a few earrings"
2.0,They cut into my leg below the knee. Not a big enough band at the top. And the slide down
2.0,"Look beautiful, not too heavy but heavy enough to constantly fell off of my ear. I lost one earing the first day I used them. I bought different colors and all fell off of my ears so I have to use another's earrings security pin to avoid losing them."
2.0,I didnt realize this was magnet action only.  you set to the size and then open and close with a little pull tab and magnet.  I didnt like it after 4 days and returned<br /><br />the webbing of the belt is stretchy- good quality but I didnt love that either for this kind of belt
2.0,Bottoms are cute but top is terrible.  Front tie is super weird and really long. The cups give no support and no matter how tight feel like you’re just going to fall out.
2.0,"I am 5'11 and it barely covered my mid thighs, had to return it"
2.0,"This pj set looks super cute and is comfortable but the quality is terrible.<br />With just one wash, the color fades and it is full of lint. It now looks like it is 10 years old.<br />I would not recommend this at all"
2.0,The colors are a little bit brighter than so much so that someone said I look like Misses Claus in this dress. I've never worn it again.
2.0,They shrunk in the wash after wearing them twice. I used cold water.
2.0,to hard to close them :(
2.0,The material is not flattering and clings to every bump and curve.  Get what you pay for.
2.0,The earrings are pretty and all but one of the sets broke as I was trying to put them on. You really get what you pay for with these.
2.0,Got xl and they feel to tight even though that's what I always wear
2.0,One of the ends is split at the seam before I have even gotten to use them.
2.0,Dress looks nice but quality not as seen on the picture
2.0,Pretty top but it was too low cut and it was hard for me to find an inner tank to cover up my chest.
2.0,Difficult to close.<br />Not light
2.0,Love this just order in wrong size
2.0,Awkward and uncomfortable.  Returned.
2.0,"Love the bag, but, unfortunately, I bought it for business travel for my Dell laptop and it's too small😕."
2.0,"The band is really nice, and a close color match to the rose gold Apple Watch.  The case is bright pink, very shiny, very flimsy plastic. Worth the price just for the band*,  I just got this, so I can’t tell you about how well the color holds up.<br />5 DAY UPDATE;  Some large scratches where color came off of magnet piece. The scratches are now silver.<br />  This band snags terribly on finer knits.<br />10 DAY UPDATE; *The rose gold color is starting to wear off revealing the silver color underneath. I no longer think this is a “great value”.  I will have to replace it soon, bringing my cost up tp that of the Brand name product.<br />  One star lost for the ridiculous case, one more star lost for snagging, one more lost for color loss."
2.0,"Very difficult to put in, as they screw together."
2.0,Doesn't look as pictured. Pearls mainly in the front and not all the way around as it appears.  I keep it but probably will put it in our club flea market sale.
2.0,"The pattern is cute, but it's upside down. It seems random at first glance, but then you realize the large skulls are upside down. I'll be returning the item."
2.0,"The bottoms were perfect.<br />The top smelled like someone had previously worn it, went swimming, and never washed it."
2.0,"Look great, but the sizing was way off."
2.0,Was not happy with the pattern
2.0,"Love the idea- took a day to get used to it being smaller yet a bit thicker than my bi-fold (maybe similar to a tri-fold?).<br />Good things: money strap holds very tightly and I found useful - in that I used it. I've always kept cash loose. Plenty of room for what most of us need. I like the firmness in my hand and the definitive way it feels in having to snap it open and closed- which brings me to---<br />Bad things: the snap/clasp cracked within a few days, and in another week broke off entirely - no dropping, just siting on wood steps. I suppose if you took care to be sure the clasp faced your butt rather than outside it would be ok, but who would do that? Second, I found if my pants or shorts were not jeans or well-fitted, when I got out of my car the wallet would slide out onto the ground - oh wait, maybe that's when clasp broke! But - it fell out and cards scattered all over in the dark, under the car - so, it's plastic, it's slippery!"
2.0,"I had high hopes for this winder. Christopher Ward in London sells what appears to be the same winder as their recommended winder. Looks the same, functions are the same, just a different label.  It was not to be.<br />First this is noisy. One was not good, I cannot imagine what 6 (the maximum stack) would sound like, It was in my bedroom, and there is no real way to program it not to rum at night other than turning it off. I put up with that for about 3 weeks, then the cover would not stay closed. At that point I gave up and returned it.<br />I found a second hand Wolfe, and have to say I love it. At 5 times the price of the Versa new, they better be good, and they certainly are. Wolfe's customer service is also great.<br />The Versa I think is a useful solution for a cheap winder. Just put it somewhere noise is not a issue."
2.0,Feels cheap and a button fell off after a few weeks.
2.0,"Not too thrilled. The material feels like synthetic, not real, leather."
2.0,"Not what I expected at all, looked like a cheap cut up t shirt, I’m not even using it like I thought I would."
2.0,ok so I wanted to like them but they look like glasses u purchase for kids they are not luxurious they aren't very cute and they look flimsy and cheap I will never wear them out
2.0,They weren't as they were described. They were pretty but not the size they said. I sent them message about returning them and they never responded. I basically wasted my money.
2.0,"We got a XL but it like a medium, just not a great size for a very tall person. 😣😑"
2.0,Cute but didnt fit me. I am 5'1 130lbs too small.<br />Will be returning.
2.0,Not crazy over this at all. Will throw it in the donation pile.
2.0,"The torso is too short for me, so the pleats fall right on my belly stretching them out. It does not look right. If I were short, this would be a lovely, classic dress."
2.0,"Looks great out of the box, size was just right, but within a month it has a huge scuff on a side and no longer looks dressy. Very disappointed."
2.0,"This product was sent back twice.  Sizing is not accurate.  The yellow part that is displayed in the pics at the top inside of the pants, does not EXIST!  False advertising at its BEST.  Disappointed!!"
2.0,"I bought these off another website, so I won't be a verified purchaser  from Amazon but look at my profile and see that I do buy loads from Amazon, so this isn't a fake or paid for review.<br /><br />Anyway, these glasses are HUGE. I wish they would have shown these sunglasses on a person's face, or at least a mannequin to get a good judgement on how big they really are. The sides of the glasses go out past the sides my face, and I am not particularly tiny. The pair I bought said they were pink and tortoiseshell frames.  The earpieces  appear solid black but I had to look really hard to see any tortoiseshell.  The pink isn't anything like what is shown, it's more of a smoky dull pink, no excitement or fun to the color at all. These glasses also feel flimsy and cheap.  I went to investigate other reviews for these glasses and there are complaints of them being fake, not authentic Coach product, that the case and paperwork isn't the same as other Coach products. Who really knows. If these glasses last, I'll update my review.<br /><br />I will most likely return these but I'm pretty desperate for sunglasses at the moment."
2.0,"Tag frame is fine. The tag lettering is just a sticker. I had to finish pressing the sticker onto the frame, because it wasn't adhered very well around the edges. I don't believe this sticker will hold up very long to the elements. I will give it a couple of weeks to see. If not, it will be returned. The finished product looks fine when installed. Expected more for the price. We'll see about longevity."
2.0,It’s a lot more green than pictured. The “flowers” are flat and very thin.  Don’t think I’ll be buying anymore. Was hoping for something a lot fuller and more “flower” looking.
2.0,"Lightweight, but the shoe doesn't hold up. The velcro became loose after 2-3 months so the shoes wouldn't stay on. Just not durable enough for kids play."
2.0,"Need sizes, a little small , its ok"
2.0,i wish i bought just the top.  The tutu had no pants attached to it so we had to find tights to wear under it since it was so sheer. i think i paid too much.  so glad i didnt get socks and hair piece.
2.0,Its not as cool and the picture looks..Its very thin.
2.0,Very slim and not much flexibility
2.0,"The shirt looks great, fits great, but doesn't feel great.<br /><br />The shirt feels like a jacket or like the material tarps for tents are made of. I put it through the wash on cold and delicate and dried it appropriately, but it just doesn't feel right. Not comfortable at all. Wont be wearing this."
2.0,"Did not fit me well , ran a little big and the seams were all crooked . Looking to return it."
2.0,Extremly small
2.0,The shirt is a comfortable material but the sizes run extremely large. I bought a small and it was way too big. Like literally falling off of my shoulders. I'm sad to return it.
2.0,Hard to get closed on wrist. Cute but cumbersome. Might order othe multiple color design
2.0,This thing was a million feet long- never used it…just ordered something else
2.0,"I really liked the color of this dress and the softness of it. The sizing was appropriate, but the cling of it wasn't doing good things for my flawed areas."
2.0,"Not the worst I have seen from ordering online, but definitely not a great quality. A little small, but more like a half size versus a full size difference. Overall with the drape and quality of the material, it showed every body imperfection. The worst part though was the ruffles - completely lifeless and distracting. Returned."
2.0,"Great idea, poor execution.  The nylon stretch material allows your foot to slide all over the place while wearing the pads.  Should have been a 50/50 cotton and spandex mix instead."
2.0,"Cute holiday-print, knit, synthetic masks. I much prefer cotton, and vendor promptly sent a refund. But if you like synthetic masks, these are cute."
2.0,"It's well made, exactly as pictured. The problem is it's size. With no frame of reference in the pictures I didn't realize how big it is. It's enormous! Way too big to want to carry around in my pocket."
2.0,"I gave 1 set of earrings to my daughter & kept 1 set for myself. The stones fell out within 1 month. I found 1 stone, the other was lost for good."
2.0,I almost lost my Fitbit in my pond because the band detached from it on one side.  Since then it has fallen  off numerous times.
2.0,"Viscose is Rayon, no wool included.  This is not pashmina cashmere"
2.0,"This shirt has a very odd fit. It's basically a tight crop top covered with an asymmetrical, cheap sheer oversized drape. In the picture it looks nice and work appropriate. In reality, I'm not going to wear a crop top to a professional job. Even to wear on weekends, this has a very cheap look and feel to it. I do not advise making the purchase."
2.0,"I only review products when they're exceptionally good or bad - these fall into the latter. I disregarded the reviews because I just wanted something for occasional warm weather rain protection. As others reported the zippers broke immediately. Not only did they break but pulled all the way out of the fabric - and then the fabric itself ripped. I still had hope because an open back would be fine keeping my feet dry, but they didn't do that either. Both leaked. This is an instance where my very low expectations weren't met."
2.0,"Nice packaging and quick shipping. The back/inside of the earring is open and not covered by the semicircle metal. The tassel is really thick and a bit bulky, so am returning."
2.0,"These were great when I first got them but after about 2 weeks, the foam bottom flattened out and I could feel the structure of the base of the slipper."
2.0,"Not at all like the picture. You get what you pay for though, and it still wears nicely!"
2.0,Isn't very bright.  Not at all compared to the picture.<br />But it is neat in a very very dark room.
2.0,"Ad states fits samsung gear S3, pets are too short and my pins are too wide 5o fit band, incomparable."
2.0,fit too big and showed waaay too much.
2.0,"I was very disappointed.  Earring was too small to cuff my ear.  Never got to wear it.  In trying to get it to cuff my ear, the neck broke.  :("
2.0,It's as described but I wore the gold plated one and immediately it turned black. The pendant still have some shine but it is not really worth the money. I am almost afraid to wear the other one. It was literally 3 hours later and it became black. I pray I did not have any negative energy.
2.0,"My other Camptrace hat is great- hence the generous two stars. The lack of the other three is because the hat is NOT the cute, bright like green as depicted: it’s pea soup baby crap green. If you want to look jaundiced or older, this is the color for you! See photo. Going back."
2.0,"Runs very big, swallowed me!"
2.0,Masks are too wide for the face for adult and kids
2.0,"Wasn’t what I expected. This bag is half the size it seem on the photo. I was soooo disappointed, I thought it would be bigger, like the size of. A regular tote bag but it’s half of that"
2.0,lasts maybe 50 days before wears out! :(
2.0,Nott he best paint job on this pin.
2.0,"I like this item in general, I wish it were a bit longer in the back. My main complaint is I returned the first one I ordered before even wearing because the stitching around the thumb holes was already coming undone and would have totally come apart in the 1st wash. Got my replacement right away, didn't really look at it because I wanted to wear it that day to a ball game in the sun. After wearing it for just a couple hours, as I feared with the last one, all the stitching around the thumb holes has come undone. This is just plain bad design, just using a different stitching or doing a hem stitch and this wouldn't happen."
2.0,The black one was hard to open. The gold one already had a loose broken clip. The silver was okay but they're all not the best.
2.0,Runs really small. The nose clip is in a weird position and ends up clamping your nostrils shut instead of clamping on the nose bone.
2.0,"I purchased this to get a baggy effect, and it barely goes over the waist of my jeans.  Super disappointed ☹️"
2.0,"I liked the weight and size of the piece, but the clasp couldn’t stay closed. I lost it within a couple weeks because the clasp gave out while I was at a restaurant and I didn’t realize until later. Waste of money."
2.0,Didn't fit right on the body.
2.0,These anklets are so cute but the small one broke. I only wore it maybe 3 days. The bigger one I had to buy a extension chain for it. I do like them alot I hope this one lasts a little longer.<br />update well the 2nd one only lasted a week/ very disappointed.
2.0,Very strong scent and it faded when I hand washed it
2.0,"Re-rated. It's 3 degrees, totalling -25 with the wimde chill currently in Fargo ND. Put these on as I left the gym for my walk home and it felt like I wasn't wearing gloves at all. Even having them in my pockets did nothing. Felt as though my fingers were being bashed with a hammer repeatedly. Worst 2 mile walk ever.  No way these will keep your hands warm at negative 30.  Apologies for changing my review to 2 stars.<br /><br />Fit well, large size. Touch screen works but is a tad finiky, I found it works great if you use the edges of the touch screen part of the glove."
2.0,"Glasses are overall pretty good, however if they get hot, either on the dash or even wearing them on a really hot day, the nose piece rubber cushions will basically become slimey and slide off the two plastic guides and will not stay on the guides after that. I have lost two sets of the rubber cushions buy taking the glasses off and not realizing they had feel off until later when I went to put them back on."
2.0,"It came in on time and it's just like in the pictures, but a week passed and the handle on the zipper broke."
2.0,"in the photo it shows black writing on hard colors but my rings have silver writing on see-through colors and the colors are off in general, some of the writing is faded under the color and is very annoying!!"
2.0,"Print on the back is super tiny.  Very difficult to read.  Otherwise, nice enough and not too large.  The chain broke right away.  The bail is now wearing thru after 6 months.  Sadly - my son really like this - so I will probably buy another at the current higher price.  I contacted the client and received absolutely no response.<br /><br />It is a cheap necklace - expect it to last like any dollar store item might."
2.0,It isn't of great quality as it broke off on my first trip.
2.0,"Opened package and found this sleep cap to be HUGE. Luckily I had ordered some others with satin lining that I wanted to try out; I'll stick to using those. May be good for others with more/longer hair, but this too much for my short afro"
2.0,Cheap costume glasses. The lens had a &#34;wave&#34; look looking thru them so you can only stand them for short periods. However for cheap costume glasses there are indeed cheap costume glasses
2.0,Pequeña y mala calidad
2.0,Stupid design.. shirt looks like it hits below hips. It does not! It’s SO short .. only keeping to peek below low cut sweat shirts for sleeves and collar to show.. .. definitely can’t wear alone.. would not buy again nor recommend.
2.0,"Color is not accurate. Not red, but instead very orange. Poorly cut and fabric is low quality."
2.0,"Frames are too big, so I'm still unable to see area of face eyes that it covers. Also lenses are so big that I'm unable to use for eye makeup because lenses when flipped down are in the way."
2.0,"The last name “Will” doesn’t look like it does in the picture, it looks bad. Looks like the other reviewers picture."
2.0,"I am super bummed, these are see through.  I bought a different pair in gray from TJMaxx and they are my favorite yoga pants, so I was so excited to find these on Amazon!  I ordered the black and can only now wear them with long shirts, and never to do yoga in."
2.0,"Really cute and they fit but BEWARE the dark green is actually blue.  I don't feel like going through the trouble of returning so I'll keep them but I hate when they advertise a color and that's not what you get.  When I looked at the picture to make sure I wasn't crazy, I realized the first two pics are green and the third shows the true color of blue.  Oh well."
2.0,"to big, to loose.. perhaps I could have went down a size.. but still the pants was to short on my ankle."
2.0,Beautiful skirt but zero give in the waist. Made for someone super tiny.... not me. Ended up giving it to someone way more slender than myself.
2.0,Very weak construction between the body and the ring. Fall apart within two days
2.0,Lost a stone about a week after getting them then lost the big stone about a month later
2.0,Picture is very misleading. The skirt is not as flowing as it looks. I thought it would be more full and it is not. It is a bit on the small size so I would size up.
2.0,"Product was good, no batteries included, the watch didn't run on the first try, the battery had to be replaced."
2.0,"My wife disagrees, but I personally think it does look like Rocky.  It actually looks just like it does in the picture here.  My problem with it, and the reason for 2 stars is because it  doesn't fit.  I have a big head so I thought it was just me. NOPE, didn't fit my wife either.  When I say, &#34;didn't fit&#34; I don't mean that I couldn't put it on.  What I mean is that the eye holes will be really close to your eye and will constantly rub against your eyelashes.  Very hard to wear something while it is attacking your eyelashes.  Your natural reaction is to close your eyes and then they start watering.  if they fixed the eye holes it would be MUCH better"
2.0,"Very stiff headband, and paint is chipping off.  Maybe made for kid’s head."
2.0,I got this bag for travel thinking it would be easier to use than my regular purse.  It is a good size but the zippers are not good at all! They get stuck everytime I try to close it .
2.0,"Great concept. Material is light,  wore once and they tore at cargo pocket."
2.0,I had to return them.  They were too large and too wide. Narrow needs to be offered for people with thin feet.
2.0,"In person these are not as nice as they appear. They are made from cheap, thin nylon."
2.0,"Too heavy, does not stay in place well"
2.0,"I really wanted to love these......but I can't say that I do. The concept is great, especially for my husband who works in a warehouse all day and has to work with elements inside and outside; however, the one he chose to wear did not last beyond two days. He frequently has to reach in boxes, pallets and operates heavy machinery including forklifts. Needless to say his real wedding band looks like it took a beating with scratching and scaring. Yesterday he touched metal piping (that was sitting outside) and the hot metal literally melted the band. When he lifted his hand the band split.<br /><br />Another issue is sizing. I ordered a Size 12. The black band was too snug to fit on his finger. The gray and the white/black multi ring fit better but was much tighter then a Size 12. We had to work to get it on his finger.<br /><br />This ring may be better suited for those that wear it while exercising or in the pool, maybe even hospital staff (continuous washing of hands and taking gloves on and off). This would be a better idea for those who need a snug fit but not subject to rough handling.<br /><br />I would not recommend this product for heavy duty handling.<br /><br />Disclosure: I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review. In no way does the discount affect my review as I also shop for products based on user reviews.<br /><br />[...]"
2.0,"After wearing this once the metal on the ends broke. It is very cheap and flimsy. I thought it would pair well with other bracelets, however, it was too cheap to wear for the entire day."
2.0,Super bright construction orange . Not sure I would wear it. Lesson learned.
2.0,"I chose this bra because I was in search of a reasonably priced, lightly lined, literally no-frills bra. This one is scratchy because of stitching on the bra straps and felt cheaply made. It also runs a bit small and I’m a pretty standard size. I wouldn’t recommend this bra."
2.0,"The purse is not lined, there are no pockets, everything lumps into the center! Leather is nice , color decent however a rough unpolished leather bag!! Save your money!!"
2.0,"I got this a month or so ago. Just decided to start using it. Got everything switched over, Went to attach the black strap, and the strap came apart. Where the swivel and latch are came right apart on 1 side.  SUPER disappointed!!!<br />Of course Ive had it a while, and have nothing for returning it.  So im stuck using a bag without the strap....which is the REASON I bought it.<br /><br />Overall, the bag itself is lovely.  Lined, big enough for everything, yet small enough not to be cumbersome.  However, if you depend on having the black strap...DONT!!  It is not well made.  If you don't mind using the smaller handles, then THIS bag will work real well."
2.0,Came with a horrid smell
2.0,Not &#34;one size fits most&#34;. I'm a size 14 and this was way too small
2.0,"I’m not sure what the manufacturers of these shirts have in mind ... ? I’m 5’4”, about 115lbs."
2.0,Wide neck. Thin material. Poor print quality. Looks like a computer print out iron on.
2.0,For small head
2.0,I ordered a large.  It came marked as XL but was actually a medium.  Gave to someone who can fit in it.
2.0,It's completely see through. You'll need to buy a slip to be able to wear this.
2.0,"It is very light and takes no space at all - I give them that, but It is not breathable, not at all. Even with open pits (that tend to jam) in mild rain at about  60F and a light backpack (~10 lb), the condensation accumulates on the inside plastic. Whatever this material is, it looks and feels like a plastic bag. I will be returning it as the price does not commensurate with the performance"
2.0,hope they dont break like my necklace
2.0,looks good until washed
2.0,Bought this the second week in February and it is already broken. It was attractive to look at and great for the couple weeks it worked but the clips fell out and now its useless
2.0,good  material. Too short  to small  i order ××large  with is a 2x it was small. My daughter  is 5 ft4 uts fit her perfectly.
2.0,"They are really pretty. Unfortunately, they come with an aggressive amount of pain. My nose also hurt a lot after removing them. I even had scabs right where the two pieces connected. However, if you are into that sort of thing...these are for you. Be careful removing them from the package. The pieces come apart and mine weren't secure. Short story, I lost pieces as soon as I opened it.<br /><br />I will say the seller was very helpful in the refund process. So, I would buy other products from them. Great customer service."
2.0,Bill is really long. Looks like a duck.
2.0,Product details said for ages 2-5 however one of the beanie's are so small it will fit a newborn ( I purchased a 3 set for my granddaughters and was disappointed to find one wasn't the same size as they are 2-4 yrs of age...
2.0,My wife thought they were uncomfortable while walking and is seeking to return them.
2.0,Had to buy two of these because the first one stopped working. The second one is doing much better and I love it.
2.0,"was to small, but the sell was understanding regarding the return agreement."
2.0,"Seriously not worth the price. I was surprised at the quality and size, given the price. The only saving grace was I bought it for about twenty dollars (which is still too much, in my opinion). Save yourself from disappointment and buy either the G4Free 40L backpack or TiBag 40L backpack, both of which I own and have also written reviews for on Amazon.<br />I gave it two-stars because I use it; I use it to hold extra plastic cutlery which is just about the only use I could think of, practically speaking."
2.0,"Fit was good and comfortable. The material has a little sheen, and I don't like the white button on dark shirt look, but for the price, it's fine. I ordered the black and dark gray. We have to use a lint brush to clean them AFTER coming out of the dryer. None of our other darks in the same load need this level of attention. So if you have pets and tend to collect a lot of fur, beware that these shirts seem to trap lint in the wash."
2.0,The green color is nothing like it shows. A bit tight and a bit short.
2.0,"Not a fan of this shirt at all.  It has shoulder pads that make zero sense, the material is itchy and the the size Large, fits almost like an XXL.  I'll be sending it back."
2.0,"This was super cheap looking, took forever to get to me and to be honest, I haven't even worn it.  It looks like a ring you get out of an arcade machine."
2.0,"Loved the fit and style, but the ""LOVE"" design shredded and flaked off immediately. One gentle hand wash and it started falling apart. It's a shame because this would've otherwise been a fav."
2.0,It makes my trips easy..
2.0,"I really loved these frames but could not use them for my prescription glasses, very disappointed"
2.0,They made it right but just beware to read size chart. This came from China and they have different sizes than U.S.
2.0,"I like the bracelet for my Alta, but within 2 months the screw came out so I cannot wear it.  I went to a jeweler and they did not have a screw for it. Ithe seller did not seem like they wanted to help me out.  I would order another one,  but maybe not from them.  I will still have to go and get it sized which is about $5 to $10."
2.0,"I thought this band was going to be great for my daughter however, she only got to wear it for a few days until it broke apart."
2.0,Very cheap material. Came with a hole in it. I had to return it. Very good customer service tho .
2.0,The zipper broke instantly on the first zip.
2.0,Did not care for these at all. Very stiff fit and runs huge.
2.0,The jacket looks great but my large fits like a medium.
2.0,The sleeves were small for an XXL size.. I dont even wear 2XL but wanted to get a bigger size because of how I was going to wear it.... very disappointed...
2.0,Nice style but seems a bit flimsy.
2.0,No sturdy enough
2.0,"Not good for kitchen work. I slip all the time at my work place. They are not safe to work inside the kitchen, but they can be useful for other projects around the house."
2.0,Disappointed looks like fashion jewelery.
2.0,I loved the look of the overalls on the pictures.  However when I received the item I was horrified that it was POLYESTER feeling!  I was wanting something that was more soft linen and not polyester!
2.0,They constantly slid down if walking around. They are warm though
2.0,"Too big, I returned it."
2.0,Cute earrings but look more like paper towels than toilet paper... Wouldn't have bought if I knew
2.0,It doesn't stand well on the head
2.0,It was just what I wanted but as soon as I went to put it on the straps broke the mask it’s self is good Quality
2.0,"This suit was intended for early graduation dance.  Fit was just right, not too loose and not too tight but two buttons from the vest and the one big button on the jacket slipped off right before leaving the house to the dance. Had to reattach all of them in a panic. Looks great though."
2.0,"Too small and fits very tight on the sides of my head. I'd like to return, please."
2.0,Buttons looked like they weren't on there that well when I received it. It looked so cute on for one event which is a shame because I Washed and dried and it turned into a children's size shirt.
2.0,Constantly falling down.  Creates a look that can only be described as “diaper butt.”
2.0,Sewing problems doesn’t fit very well
2.0,"These run super short, if you’re even average height I would not suggest. Perfect for someone maybe less than 5’2."
2.0,Very tight for a size 10. Bummed out. Likely going to return them.
2.0,"I should have paid more attention. It's lightweight, not very warm and although Merino wool, not a $25 piece of headgear. I have a poly blend, $5 beanie that is as comfortable, is warmer and stays on my head. There is no wiggle room with this one, hard to keep on. And no way if wearing while sleeping in my bag, will not stay on. Very dissapointed. Might have been just ok at a much lower price point!"
2.0,Too thin for me! Cute though
2.0,"It doesn't fit very well, but the material is good."
2.0,Really cute but it's fallen apart once in only a week of wearing it and the silver is peeling off.
2.0,I was so looking forward to this. I am a D cup and was looking forward to trying these that Ive heard so much about! These were not big enough for me and left really awkward not attractive shape in a shirt! I would say the C-D are really best for a C. I also wore it around the house and it didnt take long and the top portion kept coming loose on one side despite cleaning my skin. Not what I had hoped for
2.0,horrible. i'd send it back but it's not worth the postage.
2.0,Is too big.
2.0,"Nice looking belt, but... The leather end that goes through belt loop is too puffy so very difficult when rushing in the morning.. or anytime really.  Struggle to get through each loop.  And now after a short while also seems to be losing its stretch as loosening up and have to pull tighter.  Especially when compared to these type belts I have had for years.  On here buying another brand.  I mentioned all this when received a post purchase survey but no response.  Wanted to avoid this poor review."
2.0,"Maybe I just chose the wrong size,  but it was VERY small"
2.0,"Very nicely made, classy look and I love the flat keepers that don't flop around, BUT after a few days, the clean, classy look goes all hobo on you as it gets all fuzzy and frayed very easily.  I bought several of these which were much cheaper a year ago, all of which have been through the washer at least a couple times and they look new.  I'd pass on this one."
2.0,"These earrings are pretty.  However, they are next to impossible to fasten. They're still sitting on my vanity.  Never did get them fastened."
2.0,"I ordered dress with unicorn and that was very important for my granddaughter.<br />SO i sent them back.  They seemed to be nice dresses, just not the special one."
2.0,"This is a great watch strap. However, 2 months later it's starting to split down the center because it's essentially layers of leather glued together. For those who don't know, ""Genuine Leather"" is actually a classification of leather. It's the cheapest and less durable leather. It's often made of layers put together. Top Grain leather is the next best and next most durable. It's not actually on the top, but I didn't come up with these terms. It's a good mix of split and full-grain leather. So the best and most durable leather is Full Grain leather. It's the thick leather closest to the animal's hair and it goes deep into the Top Grain area. It's denser, stronger, and natural. Like top grain, it's one single piece. Sometimes full grain leather is sanded down and thinned out to look perfect: no blemishes or scars at all. This is great for high-end purses and watch straps. I wish this strap was Top Grain. It would last longer and not split. For $20, I think that would still be profitable but they chose the CHEAPEST leather here."
2.0,"I love them all but the cat ones, I wore them one time for about a week and when I took them out the paint was starting to come off"
2.0,"I am very disappointed. This was a gift for my 10 year-old son. The first thing I noticed is the color is somewhat off from the photos.<br />It is how ever very soft (which is the only reason I gave it a second star).<br />The main reason I have given it such a low rating, is that upon checking the connections, it was not properly done. I have included a photo. It seems like very poor quality control."
2.0,Not as nice as the Timeson one I ordered a couple months ago. The material has no body to it kinda like paper.
2.0,"This is cute, but not what I expected. It’s more of a polyester style cloth; not a sweatshirt material. It’s printed, not actually bleached. Overall cute, but not what I was looking for. The description didn’t really explain it, so I wasn’t sure what I’d get."
2.0,It does not fit well to my 11 years. I am returning it.
2.0,"Not as advertised! The bag is cute, but it is not as shown. There are no chains on the strap..also strap is not leather. Most important...the battery described is 3000mAH...not the 4000mAH as described."
2.0,Not the compression I was looking for. Nice tanks though but not what I needed. Returned.
2.0,Cheap material. Already ripped.
2.0,"The material is super shiny. I didn't get that from the picture, so it makes it look super dressy. Not necessarily a bad thing,but the style of the dress is kinda casual.  I find it rather difficult to style with shoes. I haven't returned it. Guess I'm waiting to see if i can figure it out..."
2.0,The dress was not as stated online the dress was way to small like for a Jr size
2.0,"Misleading display, as grouped with anti-slip, with cat faces on soles of these socks looking just like the anti-slip products. Am sending these back...we cannot afford slip and fall in our house!"
2.0,A 1X usual runs big on me which is why I purchased in this size in case it ran small well it runs wayyy small. Fits more like a large. Feels cheap and not worth the money. It did get here quicker than expected which was nice.
2.0,"I'm okay with the knee-length on my 5&#34;5' frame and even the swimsuit-like material, but the images stretch over my chest and and the material has several rolls on my lower back since it's one cut without a seamed waist. The images and colors on all three dresses I ordered are not as vibrant or attractive as they look in the pictures. I read tons of reviews, looked at others photos, and waited 6 months to actually buy from CowCow. I will stick with my amazing Toms Ware dresses despite the floral only skater dress options."
2.0,Pretty color but it's definitely made for a small woman. Either you sacrifice your size or the size of your breast. Just wish they would have added more material around the breast area.
2.0,"This bracelet was a disappointment...I bought it to wear at my daughter's upcoming wedding, however, I will not be able too.  It broke as soon as I went to put it on.  It is very flimsy and as for size, runs on the smaller size.  I have bigger wrists and I would have had to have worn it on the last link.  I really liked the look of it, but wasted my money!!"
2.0,The bottom front part is separated from the dress so it creates a gap. I sent it back. I would love it if it weren't for that one thing.
2.0,"Dress feels decently made, but it was much smaller than expected. Additionally, there was what looked like a burn mark on the front of the dress. Will be returning."
2.0,"It's soft, and I like the look, but I ordered a women's small, and it's so large that my 6'5"" husband can wear it."
2.0,"As soon as I opened this package, I noticed it smelled really bad...like those old, stinky permanent markers. It’s was really strong. Then I tried it on: the fit was fine, but the style I got (the buttons on the side) did not zip or fasten anywhere else. So those side buttons are all that keeps it closed. It doesn’t really provide a secure closure if the dress is a little tight or you move a certain way. Also, you have to hand wash it. Overall, a lot of trouble and annoyances for a cheap black dress."
2.0,The lace on the arms is too tight and it does not flatter the bust are as in the picture. Can I return it?
2.0,"This was nothing like I thought it was going to be, hit at the hips really awkwardly. Was not flattering. WAY to short to be worn like a dress."
2.0,It bleaches after first wash
2.0,It was dropping thread every where! My hair has white and red thread so sad! Plus The ball is attached with a glue hence already off! Plus I ordered children size and got Adult size!!
2.0,It looks large on me if i got the S size it would be better on me
2.0,It was much larger than I thought it would be. Not what I was expecting.
2.0,"This garment was just delivered. It’s gorgeous and as pictured. I did follow the reviews and size up. I’m usually a medium and the large fit perfectly. Not the finest quality in fabric but it will do for a cute spring/summer dress. I do however, have to mention that it seems like this is a returned item. Upon opening the package I found hair all over, some seems to be pet hair and others are long like human hair. Eww!! And the tags were missing. Must wash prior to use. Won’t be purchasing from this seller ever again."
2.0,"I’m worried about the decal. It does look cheap. It’s going to crack for sure, I’m afraid to wash it lol maybe I’ll hand wash and hang dry so I can be careful with the decal.<br /><br />The sweater itself is soft. I guess for $20 it’s not bad.. but I’d rather pay $40-$50 for better printing."
2.0,"I bought this bracelet because I loved the look and I loved the message. It's very stylish, the leather looks nice, it wraps around the wrist 4 times for a hipster-ish look. And the &#34;I refuse to sink&#34; message is a nice reminder to believe in ourselves at all times. Loved it.<br /><br />And then, on the third time I wore it, the anchor clasp that held the bracelet in place snapped in half, making it effectively useless.  2 stars because the style is great, and who knows - yours may last longer - but clearly the quality is lacking."
2.0,"I loved this bag initially, but it should've lasted longer than 7 months.  The stitching along the zipper is already worn in one spot.  And I Don't overfill it.  VERY disappointing."
2.0,Way too big unless you are a plus size.
2.0,I bought these shorts because they were supposed to have deep pockets.  LIE. Pockets are normal women pockets which are never deep. Your cellphone will still fall out when you sit down. Now I have to sew the pocket so my phone doesn't fall out. I hate purses and will never carry one.
2.0,I just opened and put this on today and it came with a hole in it.
2.0,Dress is cute.. but the color was not what I thought it would be... dull color.. thinking of maybe purchaseing another color .... this won’t stop me from ordering from Amazon.. great deals and sooo easy to purchase with just a touch of a button.. right!!!
2.0,"Junk. This is a cute keychain, but the ribbon displaying &#34;granny&#34; fell off after only a month and a half of use. Save your money."
2.0,"Small in the bust ,below the knee in length. Buttons don't open. Vneck is higher than pictured. Made from cheap polyester."
2.0,The material was thin. The color was good.
2.0,"Sweater is of good quality, but I’m a U.S. Size 4 or 6, 5’ 4” and it barely grazed my behind and wrists. Like a regular cardigan- not maxi- for even a Size 0 or 2 frame. Also, seller processed a refund, but not return shopping, which was 1/2 the original cost of purchase. Be aware of all before purchasing."
2.0,"It's very pretty, but... a) it's a LOT tighter than I expected. I usually wear XL, I bought XXL, and it's too tight to wear. Also, it came stuffed in a little bag, so it's all wrinkled. No worries, I'll wash it to get the wrinkles out, eh? NO. The care instructions specifically say NOT to machine wash it. I'm not going to wash a dress by hand in 2017! I would not recommend purchasing this dress unless you just plan to wear it once to a special event."
2.0,Nice little bracelet. Too bad it’s to big even on the tightest adjustment
2.0,"This is sooooooo much different than pictures make it look!  It’s a super thin material and looks totally cheap!!!  I’ve yet to wear it, but the waist is sooooo super small!!!"
2.0,Nice shirt. Way too small. I ordered a large and it barely fits my 11 year old brother. I should have taken the warning more seriously I guess.
2.0,"The garment looked really nice;  however,  the button and/or button holes are improperly placed. I tried two sizes as I thought the ill fitting was due to the size of the garment.  After purchasing a larger size,  the buttons still gapped my under garments could be seen.  This occurred in two different sizes,  neither size was too small.<br />Very disappointed,  I will be returning both dresses."
2.0,The watch just stopped working and I got it less than 2 weeks ago. Not worth the price
2.0,Point on pin head a very dull
2.0,"The dress has such a cute design, but it fit like a bag on me. Also the fabric is NOT the best. I've had dresses like this before and you cannot wash it. It will shrink and get wrinkly."
2.0,it was very short lengthwise. I ordered a size bigger and when I tried it on and it just pulled down too much in the front I could barely keep covered.
2.0,"Doesn't work with my Logitech G602 wireless mouse, likely because the surface is uniformly black.  I also don't like receiving emails asking for reviews."
2.0,Only half of the lights actually worked :(.
2.0,"The fly is too high and/or not long enough.  That is my only complaint, but it is a very serious one.  It makes using the bathroom very uncomfortable."
2.0,"To large for what I wanted. I was looking to put it in my pocket, but it's great if you want it for your purse."
2.0,This does not look like the item photo! It’s shinier and cheaper looking.
2.0,"Loved everything about these shoes.. .till the Velcro fail about a month after buying the,."
2.0,I usually wear between a 2x & 3x. I ordered a 4x and it is about 2 sizes to small and very short. Also seemed like the sewing stitch is loose too...my wifes review
2.0,It’s a very large dress especially on the sides they stick out.
2.0,"I purchased this dress for engagement pictures. I had a hard time purchasing a different dress on amazon in not ever receiving it, so I found this dress.it would have been perfect and shipped in the right amount of time.... only the wrong product shipped. The dress color was correct, but the style was wrong. It only had one long sleeve that wrapped around d the neck. Not practical for a winter engagement session. There was no time to replace as I had problems with a previous dress and had to find this one last minute."
2.0,I ordered an x-large but it was more like a medium size.
2.0,Rubber loops don't stay tight theyleep slipping.
2.0,Pockets are in awkward position and size is snug
2.0,"What I received is a rubber strap for a submariner or similar homage watch, but it is not the one pictured! I received the cheaper alternative from the same company (pictured below). It has a pretty hideous buckle and upper strap design which is inferior to the strap I ordered."
2.0,Quality is good but did not match description
2.0,Although this sweater is very soft it looks nothing like the picture AT ALL.  Totally different sweater than whats pictured as far as material goes. It is cozy and warm so I will keep it but I doubt i will wear it to work or any important function as planned. Looks more Robe Like than anything. Will be great around the house.
2.0,"Too big, unless you have a huge wrist, don't buy it.  It is not adjustable. I kept it still."
2.0,"I bought these specifically to use in a crossbody bag. They are fairly light (case + glasses) and the case is pretty small. My issue is that the glasses fit SO tightly in the case that it's very, very difficult to get them back in. It requires FORCE. There is no way these glasses are going to hold up long at all. I would not purchase them again or recommend them."
2.0,I wasn’t happy with the flimsy feel of the “safety” glasses. It’s more of like a saw dust deflector but I would be scared to wear them as the material is thin and I’d be scared if anything hit them they’d shatter or crack on my face. I threw these away immediately.
2.0,I’m so confused.  I ordeeed a medium<br /> Bc I’m size 9.  These are like a children’s medium.  Do you make men’s sizes? They appear nice.  But wow are they tiny.
2.0,"My boyfriend bought this watch for me as a gift. I originally thought I wouldn't like the rose gold color of the face, but when I got it I instantly fell I  love with it. I wore it everyday and it held up quite well however, one day I noticed that the time was a few hours behind so I reset it. Later I noticed the same issue and thought maybe the pin got caught on something so I reset it again without thinking too much about it. A few days later I noticed it again, so once again reset it. Later that evening the watch read an hour or two later than the the time I had set it for earlier. Also notable is that the wristband holes wore a little easier than I expected. The watch looked, fit and felt great on my wrist but it quit working a month  after I got it."
2.0,"These shoes were absurdly small- They claim to be a size 1, which is a size up for my 6 year old and they barely fit the feet of my 4 year old (who wears a toddler size 10. They look adorable, and I would be tempted to re-order, but the sizing is so far off that I wouldn't even know where to start."
2.0,"Purchased this dress for a wedding really glad brought a backup. the material is misleading in the photos- most definitely thought it would have more stiffness to it. Also it is very, very short!"
2.0,"The dress is cute, fit well and I thought I would buy again. Then I noticed what looked like a large deodorant mark on the skirt. The garment must have come that way as I did not have deodorant on.<br />No worry, thought I would just throw it in the wash. Well it was not a stain. It was a flaw in the fabric. Like when it’s stretched too far and the elastic breaks and leaves little white broken threads.<br />So really cute, just this little flaw. Not a but again for me😔"
2.0,Items look like pics but smaller than average midi rings. I will probably have to wear them only on pinky.
2.0,It Didn't Look The Same As In The Picture.
2.0,Completely see through dress
2.0,These are really cheaply made earrings.  I just bought them bc I needed something for a plaid theme.  I didn’t even end up wearing one pair because they didn’t hang right for me.  They twisted sideways a bit and just didn’t look good.
2.0,Its only one sock for 10 dollars. Like what I thought it was a pack for 10 dollars. but nah one sock but whatever.
2.0,"Love the color & it's super comfortable, but a couple of months of wear and it keeps falling off.<br />The part that clips into the Fitbit isn't thick enough, so the latch comes loose & it falls off. Luckily I've caught it each time as it slipped, but today was 3x in less than 10 minutes & I'm done.<br />Ordering something else"
2.0,Material is thin and shirt is short waisted.<br />I expected a heavier jersey with some stretch and movement.
2.0,"Could be amazing if sewn correctly. Random pen on dress, stitching coming undone. She haven’t even worn it yet other than to try it on long enough for me to take these pictures. Shown in pictures."
2.0,"this skirt was too tight and not modest for my liking.  i am a size 6/8 but i don't think it works for my body type.  from the customer review pics, this skirt seems to work better for ladies with wider hips"
2.0,"I was trying to replace a well-worn, much love pair (on the right in photos). While similar, the pair I received is not what is represented in the product description."
2.0,"The waist is higher up right under the chest, not as pictured on the model. I am 5’3” and the dress came down so mid calf and maybe even longer. It’s super comfortable but not flattering at all."
2.0,"It arrived as shown, but without any real directions.  It comes in various little pieces that you must decipher and figure out what connects to what.  Very difficult, but if you are good at puzzles it might work."
2.0,The fabric is very thin around the chest area. I had to wear some sort of tank top under so you wouldn't see through. The part by the armpits is very low causing you to see your undergarments when you list your arm.
2.0,Loved the color and the material except it did not wash well. Very wrinkled. I didn't want to dry in the dryer for fear of shrinkage. I would not buy again.  Also I thought there was gathers on the sides but it was just straight.
2.0,poorly made and doesn't fit properly. One of the locking latches is damage.<br />Not recommended. Flimsy
2.0,Omg i ORDERED a medium-sized but its more like a 1x..
2.0,Quality of shirt is cheap.
2.0,It just wasn’t flattering on my body. I am 5’8 and have hip dips. This suit made them very visible. Print is cute good material just not flattering on me!
2.0,I'm a US size 16 and this definitely does not fit me. Will have to take to a Seamstress because this color is hard to find and this is what my bride wants.
2.0,Smaller than expected and hard to open
2.0,I bought these for a dog leash but would not trust them to hold up on a strong dog.
2.0,"The tail is great! I still use it, but the ears? They were really low quality, and they didn’t even look like fox ears."
2.0,Talla L pero no me quedo el vestido está lindo pero no tiene elasticidad sería bueno que le cambien talla le pongan m. Usualmente yo uso l  me queda M Pero me gusta mejor l
2.0,"I had two pairs of basket-set earrings- 3mm and 5mm. When I lost the 5 mm pair, I ordered another pair, received them and  went on about my business  About a month later, when I happened to toss the new pair into the same box with my 3mm pair, I realized I couldn't tell them apart- they were ALL THE SAME SIZE.  I  didn't realize it until after the return window had closed.  So, if you order these, hopefully you have some reliable way to gauge the size..."
2.0,The box it arrived in looks more expensive than the necklace. Looks cheap and the lettering is too big.
2.0,"Based on the photo, the top should have at least reached the waistline, but instead, it barely w went past my books.  I also ordered a large, but it was two sizes smaller.  I returned it."
2.0,There was too much to say negative or positive about this dress. It shows that it will be a full dress but you need to put it on as a robe and tie it yourself. I felt like I was going to bake pies for my husband when he got home lol it seemed like very good material just wasn’t my style.
2.0,"Flimsy, won't last more then a week. Do like the way they fit though"
2.0,Clip keeps coming undone.
2.0,These tights are long enough to fit someone maybe 5' 4&#34;.  I am 5' 9&#34; and the crotch hit maybe 3 inches above my knees.  They fell down all night and were terribly uncomfortable.  I gave them 2 stars instead of 1 because they didn't snag or run.
2.0,Designed poorly!<br />the nose bridge of mine came completely crooked and cant be fixed.
2.0,"Unfortunately, while great looking, this watch is also inaccurate and had an odd moisture issue I can't explain.<br />It would consistently get at least 5-10 minutes ahead within about 24 hours. Also, while working one day I noticed the face was cloudy and I thought I scuffed it against something. Upon closer inspection, I saw that there was moisture inside, which to my best knowledge could only have been gear lubricant since the watch had never been exposed to water aside from hand washing (I take my watch off before showering and hadn't been swimming since getting it).<br />I'm not really sure what was going on, but it was inaccurate anyway and not worth troubleshooting."
2.0,"I was really hoping this would be cute, but it looked like a tent on me. I sent it back. The color is a lovely kelly green."
2.0,"I bought this for my niece who is crazy with One Direction.  I haven't given this to her yet but I personally was very disappointed at the quality of this bracket.  The idea is cute to have all the singers pictures on the bracelet but the pictures which are a very thin layer of plastic look like they were just glued onto the bracelet randomly, I mean some of them are so crooked that i have to literally lift them up and repaste them!  Overall, this is a VERY CHEAP quality bracelet but who knows, maybe my niece will still love it because it is One Direction......"
2.0,Bought 2 and both arrived with the bags open. Very little if any chemical on the cloth. Very poor job in cleaning.
2.0,"The cut is flattering and color is as shown. Perfect, right? Wrong. Sweat seeps through like nobody’s business. It literally looked like I peed. 2/10, would not suggest if you’re gonna sweat. Save them to lounge in or do something non sweaty."
2.0,"I got it and have received numerous compliments on it. There were no markings on mine as previously reported in earlier reviews. The chain is a little short & the clasp is difficult to get into the small link.  Changing my review because the chain is very delicate & today as a result, I lost it"
2.0,The matierial is beautiful and so soft and fuzzy but the fit is nothing like the picture. It is in no way and off the shoulder sweater as pictures. The top shoulder part is tight and not slouchy and the length is very short of the whole shirt. If you have a large chest the shirt is a belly shirt and just bunches up around your shoulders and doesn’t come down like pictured. Bummer.
2.0,"Bought for my daughter to use with a dress.  She did not like it, so we returned.  It is extremely small...so consider sizing up when ordering."
2.0,My chain broke after 3 days.
2.0,"The letters are super orange…. Not like the picture, runs a little bigger but the fabric is very soft I like that."
2.0,"True to size but they don’t stay up very well. I have to keep pulling up at the waist and crotch. It’s not a situation where it rolls over, it’s like the entire thing slowly slides down during exercise. If you’ve ever worn pantyhose it’s just like that. 5’4” 180lbs and have an athletic build."
2.0,"The quality of the dress was decent overall, but the neckline was AWFUL. I wore this to a wedding last night, and it does not look like the picture at all. There is too much fabric that opens up in the front like a parachute when you lean forward and makes you feel like you’re going to flash your “girls” at everyone the whole night. Unless you are a seamstress and can fix issues like this, I would not recommend buying this dress."
2.0,"Design started chipping off within a few weeks, barely protects your phone, if you're gonna use this case you *need* a screen protector. Overall, barely does its job, would not recommend."
2.0,The fabric stretches out after 2 to 3 wears. The leg holes have stretched out so much that she trips over them.
2.0,"I ordered this ring for my 15 yr. old daughter. This was for a special True love waits ceremony and we took this seriously. The ring is very pretty but the size 6 we ordered was more like a size 9, which was very disappointing. When this ring was placed on her finger it was meant to stay there, not fall off.So needless to say the ring did not stay on and now we are looking for another one."
2.0,Not baggy looking. Ordered my size and it is very snug. Would have needed a size or two bigger to have that look. Good material.
2.0,"I like these, the fabric, the waist but the length was like capris on me.... not full length pants at all.  Great for capris/pedal-pushers"
2.0,"I am a huge easy spirit fan and have always been willing to pay extra to get the quality that easy spirit always gives me -- until now.  The left shoe is okay, but the right shoe is very tight on my foot, both the length and the width.  I have never had the situation from easy spirit or any brand of shoe that one shoe fit and the other didn't.  I checked the size of the right shoe and it is the same as the left, 7 1/2, but it is definitely smaller.  I can wear these shoes for an hour or two, but after that my right toes and foot are too uncomfortable.  I've already worn them for a day and so can't return them.  How disappointing."
2.0,So I ordered a 36 dd and recieved what looked like a 34 C…. The bralette is super cute but with a bust like mine I need a bit more coverage. My nipples pop out of the top and the front closure snapped within a Minute of me putting it on. May work for smaller bust sized but not heftier ones
2.0,The lanyard safety clip broke after a week of general use as a badge holder.
2.0,Too small. Didn't like the material.
2.0,To short it fits more like a regular top other than that the colors i are ok
2.0,"Dress in picture had longer sleeves..  The one delivered had very short flouncy sleeves. Not appropriate for the occasion, so regretfully will be returned :(  I needed longer sleeves.  Nice dress, just not the one pictured."
2.0,Match at all. Embarrassing. Will wear a sweater over it when I go out.
2.0,It did not com with pockets and it’s a body hugging style. Does not flair out as the picture shows. Returning this dress.
2.0,"They're pretty, but the post fell off of one the second time I tried them on.  Be careful putting them on"
2.0,"I like the product however, I'm disappointed they dont fit my raybans, like many reviews said. So that is why I am giving 2 stars"
2.0,This shirt is not a midum for American males. To small . I will give it as a gift to someone.  If I washed it  there is no way to get it over my shoulders .
2.0,Omg!! This is so cheap i regret buying most of my things on this site.
2.0,I purchased two of different colors.  I like that this hangs vertically from my purse.  Easy to grab sunglasses when needed.<br />I don’t like that both came with broken snaps.  So not a secure closure.
2.0,Looked so fake
2.0,"This is probably the most rediculous bathing suit I have ever put on. The top is small and bottoms are big. My little Bs are popping out the sides. I have a wide chest and a large gap, and this top seems made for those that touch. It was extremely confusing to put the top on when there is probably 10 ways to wear it. There's just too much going on for me. Push up is a joke. The back clasp is painful, hard to use, and a joke. Overall I hate it and wish I saved my money. But do what you will with my input.<br />I'm 36-28-36 (bust,waist,hip) 5'3 at 133 lbs<br />Bottoms fit good but too much coverage for my liking. Oh and great color. I ordered the Medium."
2.0,Not a very good shirt... wouldn't purchase again.
2.0,Keeps breaking
2.0,Bought this to keep Alzheimer's mother from taking off incontinence pad at night.  Bought two back to back and have had no problem with the other one.
2.0,Poorly made and thin. Hand wash for sure but didn't last three savings.
2.0,"Top gaps a ton, and cups don’t provide support. Runs large too. But of course, bottoms run small."
2.0,Hard to put on since they are on the small size
2.0,the only problem i have is that the arm hole is not adjustable and it doesn't fit on me. I had to gift it.
2.0,Returned. Almost a plasticity material. Fit was large on me.
2.0,"Too clingy for me. Won't wear in public, okay around house and maybe to pool."
2.0,Laughable quality
2.0,"These shirts run two sizes too small.  Followed their size chart and ordered a medium which I couldn't even try on it was so small.  Returned it and ordered a large which I could get on but was so tight the buttons were stretching.  I had to pay for return shipping. After the second shirt didn't fit, I didn't order another.<br /><br />I'm 5'7&#34; tall, 160 lbs. HWP.  I'm not a big guy.  I've found that, more often than not, vendors selling these Chinese made shirts provide dramatically incorrect sizing information."
2.0,"The blue and white paisley pattern is pretty, but I question the decision to put brown (blond wood colored) buttons on the front when a white to match the pattern would have been more  appropriate and stand out less. I'd swap them out if I intended to wear the shirt but the waist hits me too high to be at my waist but too low to be an empire . I'm not a long waisted person and don't usually have this trouble with clothes. It's not flattering at all, and has seams in odd places so it's not comfortable, in spite of softness of the fabric."
2.0,"The watch concept is interesting, however it has to improve the quality."
2.0,"Material is very cheep, Also the straps are nothing like the picture shows. I ordered a small but the dress is a bit large in width but short in length (stops above my ankle) I am 5'9 130lbs. Shipping also took a long time. Overall the dress was a disappointment."
2.0,Very poorly made. Snaps didnt line up and it fell apart on day 2.
2.0,The &#34;beading&#34; at the top is very shallow and looks pretty cheap.
2.0,The picture makes it seem bigger and I received two lefts. They are so fragile and the part to clasp is not aligned.<br />Will be returning.
2.0,The chain is cheep.  And the emblem is so small you can’t reed the writing with out a magnifying glass.
2.0,"Very Petty dress but way to small, like 2 sizes."
2.0,"It was ok. Wore it for Halloween and lasted for a few minutes before it became too much of a hassle and had to take off and re arrange. See some point, I just took it off and let out sit on my shoulder before putting it back on and taking off again. Did that several times throughout the night. Next time, I'm saving my  time and money and will use color hair spray and style next time."
2.0,the thumb in seam ripped after 3 days of wearing all the print is coming off and the pads are ripped and the rubber on top is coming in done from the gloves bought less than 2 weeks ago
2.0,not good for mechanic work
2.0,What did not work when I received it
2.0,Cheap looking! But what do you expect for under $10 bucks???
2.0,These fit nicely but I do not like the fabric. They're stiff and cheap and my god they stink of chemicals even after a wash.
2.0,"It was an absolutely lovely gift, the chain is cheap material, the tag was nicely made well matched metal and picture, sadly after wearing it for a week the image in the front started to peel,  the engraving I thought would have been on the back, it was in the front and it smudged away with the image. I think they should put a seal on the front or cover the tag in epoxy resin to make the image last."
2.0,I am an average side woman and they were so SMALL at the ankles I couldn't wear them. Took forever for them to arrive.
2.0,Lints after one wash. Poor quality. The heart print came off in one wash. Fits as expected.
2.0,"The material if the skirts were flimsy. Not suitable for work as I intended. I will use around the house, not flattering at all."
2.0,Don't like all the stretching.<br />Should have told me upfront?
2.0,Way to small giving it go my daughter she will grow into it i am size med top and i orderd a large and it is tooo small very nice sweatshirt and good quality but should of orderd 2x its so small
2.0,I love the way the skirt looks. I just wished it actually fit. I normally wear a medium (7/8) so I decided to buy a large since other reviews said it was too small. Well.....the large on me was so small that it would probably fit a size 4/5 person perfectly. I am 5’1 and weigh 140lbs. To fit in this skirt I would probably need a XL or 2XL. The second picture shows how much was still open when trying it on. If you have a very tiny waist then it’ll most likely fit with a size up. I also noticed the buttons looked a little worn out. I am a little sad this skirt didn’t work out for me. :(
2.0,This shirt was clearly ripped off of romwe or shine and the tags to show that were cut off. This shirt was particularly cheap and ill-fitting. If you are tall or have a longer torso this definitely isn’t for you. I’m really disappointed in the quality and will be returning.
2.0,If you have a small back like I do (I wear a32g ) this will be way to big  I ordered the large and was way to big for my back.
2.0,"The color looks nothing like the picture. It’s like a putrid yellow, not camel at all. I thought it might grow on me, but no."
2.0,Much different style than the ones I had purchased prior to. Feel of fabric also and refund/exchange is challenging since I have to wait for an email response and approval.
2.0,What a bummer these run so small because they are very cool.
2.0,This item was shipped with no protective wrapping of any sort.  It was merely flung into a box unprotected along with a packaged knife and left to rattle around in a huge box with a few gobs of brown paper packed inside.  The item was scratched on the very front surface and appeared &#34;shop warn&#34;.  I wanted to give this gift to my daughter for x-mas but will now have to explain to her why it's scratched - maybe she can make some use of it for something else as it is NOT gift quality at this point.  Fortunately it was not an expensive item so I will not take the time or energy to return it.  I'll just purchase another one locally.
2.0,"Good Glove, arrived missing one liner."
2.0,"i didn't like these. firstly in order to fit me i had to max them out. and i'm not even that tall! i'm like 5'10&#34;. secondly, they say something like &#34;suspender depot&#34; or something on the leather joiner which i didn't like. i bought them to wear with a tux - i'm not having &#34;suspender depot&#34; (or something like that) on my back."
2.0,This necklace is o.k. but the ring attaching the pendant to the chain is so cheap and small that the pendant can't slide or stay flat against your neck. Weird.
2.0,This suit did not fit as expected (it's made for those with short torsos).  My daughter is slim and tall therefor it did not fit her body properly.
2.0,These lasted 2 wears. They were super cute but after one day of sitting the seams started to come apart.
2.0,Two shorT
2.0,Very small sizes
2.0,"I put on the gloves like 4 times and they started tearing and ripping at the seams. It started with the fingers then near the middle of the forearm. By the 6th wear they were unusable. Works fine if you are wearing it once for less than 2 hours, any more and they disintegrate"
2.0,Nice and light. FITS A BIT SMALL
2.0,"I bought these to cover my tattoos for work and right off the bat, they’re WAY too sheer. You can see the tattoos and most details. They’re also really tight on my arms."
2.0,"Not impressed so far, there is no way these will fit an average sized 6 year old- the arms are too long, and the lack of nose support mean that they will just fall right down the front of the face.<br /><br />Frame is also a little clunky, the product photos do a good job of hiding this."
2.0,Bulky for the pocket
2.0,Not a good fit! Still can't get band on ☹
2.0,"They arrived quickly and packaged adequately.  However, they say they are adjustable but they are not.  If they are talking about how they stretch wider so you can put them on, then yes...but don't let it snap onto your head because that hurts!  And the wire that wraps around the ear pieces is a thin, very hard wire (reminds me of a coat hanger).  They do not fit snugly on my ears so there are areas where the wind blows in. Other than the color and shape, not what I expected from their description."
2.0,Fabric was soft. Color was nice. Way too boxy and long. Very unflattering.  Wasn't cut right for me.
2.0,"Design didn’t match images, still a cute dress but the cut at the top was way too high"
2.0,"Very thin, stiff, and wrinkly material. I feel like the Hulk when wearing it. Smaller in the arms than expected. I got a Large and I am usually between a Medium and Large."
2.0,Runs huuuuuuuge
2.0,These will work best for smaller chested women. I am a 40C and these didn't really do much for me.
2.0,Very pretty but the collar is small. Sized more for a child's neck
2.0,"We swim competitively and these lasted a couple months maybe. The Speedo ones we had lasted much longer, so will probably be reordering those."
2.0,Loved the selection and colors. But a few have defects. Planning on returning them because I’m afraid the will break.
2.0,"It was very pretty but way too see through, you can see everything."
2.0,It is a lot bigger than shown and is not flattering at all.
2.0,Unfortunately these earring only lasted a couple of months.  The post broke right off the hoop.
2.0,Will start off with the shorts are very stretchy and comfortable. The button is very flimsy and feels like it will easily break off. The back pocket has a corner missing. It looks like they took a razor and cut it off. Might be able to ruffle it up a bit to make it look more like it is suppose to. Not very impressed.
2.0,"The boots smell because they are not leather. They are vinyl. Cute and comfy, but not leather"
2.0,"The description says ""sweater"". It is not a sweater at all. It's more like a long sleeve t-shirt. Very disappointed."
2.0,"Got this in the mail today and only recieved the nude bra. The little baggy it comes with, the zipper is ripped off almost completely. The nude will do but, I would have liked to have both bras since it is what I paid for."
2.0,"This isn't actually titanium, it's stainless steel. They're flat out lying. I'm not gunna give my money to liars, will be returning."
2.0,It will fade very quickly. I've had this for maybe 6 months and all that I see now is red with a huge silver hole in the center where the red just faded away or rubbed off.
2.0,"This felt awful to the touch, and I am typically a smaller xl, so I ordered xl, because I was told by Amazon “fits as expected, order usual size”. Don’t. It has a side zip and I still couldn’t get it over my bust."
2.0,I did not think that product was true to picture.<br />Picture shows sleeves as being much shorter and neckline much deeper<br />than what  arrived.  Fit was not flattering at all - kind of bulky.  Material kind<br />fo bulky..... returned it.
2.0,The only thing good about this is it works as an apron. The quality of the print is really poor though. You can see how pixelated the picture is and I wish they did a better job. Save your money and get a better quality apron elsewhere.
2.0,"I just thought I wasn't used to using reading glasses since I am new to the whole process. Every time I used them, I strained and got a headache. It seems my eye  that made the computer glasses. Quality construction but I ordered other eyekepper plain glasses that are normal use and they are much better.<br /><br /> I am using +.50 as prescribed by my eye doctor."
2.0,"I bought this for my granddaughter and while putting it on the first time, she dropped it and it broke apart. Very cheaply made, might be okay for dress up."
2.0,"Pants fit to size, top is short."
2.0,I ordered the mint green. The color was gorgeous the material is stretchy and feels good. But the design overall didn't turn out for me as in the pictures. The neck was too small and oddly placed even for an asymmetrical top. The draped part therefore didn't sit right and neat like the picture shows. It was bunched up around the neck. The shape too was very wide at shoulders and too narrow at waist.
2.0,"Really liked the cut of these dresses, however my wife was not impressed on how the fabric was stitched together. The pattern would cut across the seam making for an awkward transition."
2.0,Beware dyed stones that the dye leaks off to skin.
2.0,Im sure my title speaks for itself
2.0,I do have trouble finding comfy shoes.  I have owned (and love) many pairs of Easy Spirit shoes.  These were too narrow (even in WIDE).  Was sorry they didn't work out for me.
2.0,They had polka dots that Imdid not expect??? I thought plain black sherr
2.0,Not terrible but not something I would buy again
2.0,"Would never buy this product again. After the first week, the studs started falling off. Not impressed at all."
2.0,Well let start off by saying i bought the Iron Man ones and the Capt America ones at the same time. Both Large. Iron Man ones fit perfectly but the Capt America ones are too small. Unsure which size is right. But Iron Man ones are wonderful.
2.0,"Loved the look and was shocked at how narrow they were, and I have narrow feet. Had to return. They look really nice tho"
2.0,"The look of this shirt was so fashionable to me, I had to have it..<br />So I got it..<br />Wore it...<br />Felt confident..<br />Washed it..<br />Line dried it..<br />Only to become extremely faded after juat one wash."
2.0,"Teeny tiny, can't tell what they are from two feet away"
2.0,"I bought 2 of these, same size different colors for a birthday party for twin girls. They sent me 2 of the same color so I wasn't happy at all.  I tried to resolve this issue and they didn't write back to me at all!"
2.0,"These are really cute.  My 10-year-old son has been wearing boxer briefs for years.  He was ready to move up a size so I found these.  He is in a size 14-16 (tall for his age) and picked these out based on liking the colors. I purchased 2 packs. Pretty much from the beginning of wearing them, he has complained about them riding up his leg easily. I don't know if that means the leg is made smaller, but the complaints have gotten so bad already that I will definitely need to buy him new underwear.  These have now been worn and washed several times and the thread is also already fraying on several pair.  Would not recommend."
2.0,Received 100% polyester shorts with zipper. Not anything like what is advertised.
2.0,Cheap quality.  This fits somewhat small and the quality isn't so great.  You get what you pay for.  It is a cute and simple style for everyday wear.  I purchased to go with sandals and they do match perfectly.
2.0,"Very inexpensive material, but at this price I guess that is what you should expect. Better to pay a little more and get a quality product."
2.0,Was to big but nice..
2.0,Skin cant breathe under ring. Turns finger white like a band aid.
2.0,It breaks easily.. Always have to fix it..
2.0,Meh.... Very GAUDY.... cheaply made.
2.0,"This product did look somewhat like it did on the website, however it was much cheaper and very cheap looking once I received it. The necklace itself has already broken on me and is not fixable. But I guess considering the price, I should have known what to expect..."
2.0,I was disappointed when I opened the package.  The material does not fold.  The hat is awkwardly shaped and does not feel like it can be folded (like it looks in the picture).  If all just falls straight down.  Not sure if my daughter will end up using it.
2.0,Not the wrap for you if you have a belly.. not wide enough at all slides up and down makes you look preggo
2.0,I gave it away to a kid because it was falling apart upon arrival and was small.
2.0,The orange ones broke instantly after opening.  Im sure more will break.
2.0,"I don’t love this dress. I ordered several styles in my quest for dresses with pockets and this one fell flat. The large fit fine, I am 5’3” and 145 lbs. The skirt went all the way to the floor. The first issue was the way the horizontal stripe on type caused my chest to disappear. The belt did nothing but look frumpy and did not help add definition to the waist. I have an hour glass figure (carrying extra weight in butt and thighs) but this dress made me look broad and shapeless. The color of the stripes is a lovely navy blue but the skirt reminds me of my old gym shorts. Faded looking right out of the box. So, this dress wasn’t a winner for me and will be returned."
2.0,"Pros: The color matched what the picture showed. That's about the only positive of this product.<br /><br />Cons: I ordered the pants with size 34 (US 2XL) and they fit like a pair of skinny jeans and are extremely tight at the waist so not only are their labels incorrect but the sizing chart they have posted on the product are also incorrect. Pants that supposedly measure to the size mentioned would fit far better than what I received in the mail.<br /><br />Other notes: They feel like they are made of parachute material, I expected something more akin to a typical BDU pant but I wouldn't be opposed to this material if the pants fit as advertised."
2.0,Son fácil de limpiar.. no son transparentes..<br />Elasticidad está muy bien..<br />Lo único que no me gusto fue que están muy anchas de la parte de arriba de la nariz muy flojas y se mueve .. fue lo único que no me gustaron ..<br />😞😞😞😞 lo siento.. gracias..
2.0,"i returned this shirt the day i received it, it's not flowy style like shown in picture, it's just a regular t shirt but shorter. Also the choker piece was very very loose fitting."
2.0,"These run very small.  I wear a 9-10 and got the size large.  I had to return them because they fit like an 8 and 1/2.  Such a shame, because they looked so comfortable and cute."
2.0,"The picture makes these shorts look silky and flows, but they’re pretty thick and stiff fabric.  Still ok-looking, just not like the picture."
2.0,Super big piercing. Don't like it at all.
2.0,Nice but only recieved one single earring not the set that I paid for
2.0,Way too big sent back
2.0,La calidad muy buena el talle no le corresponde es muy grande
2.0,Unpleasant to wear and I'm told it did nothing for prevent snoring.
2.0,Not as nice as photo
2.0,Literally the only pair of socks that made my feet smell after 2 days wearing them. I tried another pair and same thing 2 days later...<br /><br />The reason I'm leaving a review is I was annoyed that the title made it known this helps with odor when that wasn't even an issue with me in the first place. especially because currently at my job the only sweating I'm doing is last circle in Warzone while on my gaming laptop. Imagine if I had a strenuous job.<br /><br />Well priced so not 1 star.
2.0,Super cute and fits as stated. However not even two weeks later (and she doesn't wear them every day) and the toe seam is already splitting.  Poor quality.
2.0,Not much detail as pictures showed
2.0,Watch started falling apart after a month of use.
2.0,"Having an older pair of Merrells, I thought for sure these would be as comfortable, and fit my foot as perfectly. I was extremely underwhelmed  by these. Because of the super high arch support, it felt like there was a river rock under my instep. Tried to correct with different insoles, and it worked to some extent. I don't have flat feet, but unless you have very high arches, these will be really uncomfortable as-is out of the box. let's face it, if you're paying this much for boots, they should feel a lot better than $19.99 no-name Fleet Farm budget boots. These boots look very nice, and are great if you're sitting around, or you want to impress your snobby friends. If you're shoveling, or working outside, these things would be murder. Sorry, but these would only work if you found the right insoles to add and wore super-cushy socks. Definitely explore other brands for comfort. Buy these if you have uppity,  vapid neighbors to impress with names like Merrell and Vibram. I wanted to give a generous 3 stars because they are nice-looking boots, and you can make them work if you spend more money to fix the issues. But, I felt it was more fitting to dock 3 stars because nobody should have to do that with boots over $100"
2.0,Well just got my dress tonight it has a small hole in the front of the dress so that is horrible I will be returning such a let down was going to wear this to a wedding!  Other then that dress fits nice everywhere the bottom is just a but to wide n seems like yo mich material.
2.0,looked like bronze for about a month or so before turning to a copper color. I have other bronze items that have not made this transformation. Very light weight to the beads as well. Seems like copper or some alloy treated to look like bronze. It's sad because this company has some nice designs.
2.0,"Size chart is SO far off. Order one size up, no more. I ordered 2 sizes up based on reviews and it's a muumuu on me."
2.0,"I bought an extra large because that's what size I normally am. Holy mother of HUGE! Even though the tags say XL, there is NO WAY that it is. I love the colors and the &#34;boy short&#34; bottoms which is why I purchased it, but will have to return as soon as possible"
2.0,"Very thin, shear material.  Provided no protection."
2.0,"Smell is awful, stitching is not good , and out layer leather came damaged , not good very disappointed"
2.0,"Is cute, but started ripping right after I got it. I've lost my debit card twice from it falling out"
2.0,"Just looked huge on my feet, felt heavy when I walked in them.  Dislike."
2.0,"It's baggy as it should be, but it's completely see thru!"
2.0,"Beautiful shirt, lovely material! 2x would fit a child!"
2.0,"its ugly in real life, it looks like a little girls play headband and the roses come off real easily."
2.0,This ring is huge.  It's even loose when I put it on my thumb. Close to unwearable.
2.0,I absolutely loved how well this dress fit and flared. It was exactly what I was looking for and instantly became my favorite dress. Until I went to hand wash it in cold water without fabric softener. The dye leaked out and when it dried the red bled into the yellow and the pattern is discolored. I tried washing it again right away in cold water and got the same result. It’s very disappointing.
2.0,"I really wanted to like the Republic Chrono Aviation watch. It's very handsome in person, but the quality of the construction just doesn't match the price. Two big problems:<br /><br />1. On mine, the second hand was misaligned. It does not point straight up at the top of the minute and does not properly point to any of the second hash marks on the dial.<br /><br />2. The chrono start/stop/reset buttons have a very cheap movement to them that takes more force than it should, doesn't always register a click, and feels like it could break at any moment.<br /><br />When I spend $100 on a watch, I know I'm not getting a Rolex. Nevertheless, everything should at least align properly, and the controls should give you confidence that the watch will last for many years to come."
2.0,"They fit well and we're comfortable but, they have 2 layers and the fingers of the inside layer pull out as you remove them. Got annoyed trying to push them back in so just returning."
2.0,This dress is cute but arrived with a broken strap (plastic clip connecting strap to dress is missing). I had ordered it for a vacation I'm going on this weekend and tried to order another one to exchange to receive before I leave town Friday but it's not available so I will be returning the dress.
2.0,It does cut down the glare but it also hides your headlights...not good for night driving....ok for day
2.0,"O-rings become soft and fall off of glasses after a couple of weeks.  Straps are great, but would not buy again."
2.0,Too small around chest. Not sized right.
2.0,"As a nurse I am typically on my feet for at least 10-12 hours a day during my shift so I decided to give compression socks a shot. These socks are super cute and boy do they compress. A bit too much, really. I wear a size 9 shoe and the largest part of my calf measures 14&quot; so I got a medium. The foot part of the sock is a smidge too big, and the top of the sock is like a boa constrictor that hasn't been fed in a very, very long time. It's so tight that it made it very uncomfortable and pinchy right at the knee. (Ouch!) They weren't too difficult to put on - think panty hose difficult (but definitely not like Spanx difficult.) Overall they're just kinda meh. I was really hoping these would be great."
2.0,These pants are well made but they run small.
2.0,Not as classy looking in person..bought for a wedding but def can't wear there or church
2.0,"ORDERED---XXL<br />TO SMALL ,WASN'T HIGH WAISTED. VERY DISAPPOINTED"
2.0,Love the color of these socks but when wearing them with boots or shoes with a angle my feet slide up and down and it kind of hurts my toes.
2.0,"Wore this for about 4 months and the peg broke like many of the reviews already on here. Thought about seeing if they would replace it but with the high rate of failures in the reviews, I will just look for a better made belt."
2.0,"Loved the look and fit, but the button back neck was weird.  No matter what I did, it didn't look right.  Returned."
2.0,Looks like kids jewelry
2.0,i order 9.5 for my toddler son  and it is way too large i am so disappointed
2.0,I’ve had this thing about nine hours and the plating is already half gone. Nine hours. What a crock.
2.0,Sizing was wrong girlfriend really like look and design
2.0,"I used them to clean my jewelry always but actually the quality is not the same I wasted my money, not recommendable at all!!!"
2.0,I have a large wrist and this is too small. The ends are about an inch apart.
2.0,Thought these were cotton material. They aren't.  Can't wear them. I should have checked closer.
2.0,Pants torn the minute they came...
2.0,The shirt is nice but is nowhere near an American XXL.  It isn't even an XL.
2.0,"The item for sale was listed as ""wide"". It was not. Returned. They were needed for a special occasion, and he couldn't fit it because they were not wide enough."
2.0,It's more for people who have a big wrist. It's a unisex bracelet but fairy big for a woman.
2.0,Claw kept falling off
2.0,Be advised these are super tiny.
2.0,"These pants are the worst! Not like pictures. High water straight legged, the buttons where all uneven, ended up snipping them off, they looked terrible. Hemming coming apart, had to repair the zipper. Ugh nightmare"
2.0,"Not a bad hoodie, but the stripes on sleeves and the design are thick and cheap and stick to each other. Highly recommend to wash inside out and lay flat to dry. I don't even trust my dryer's air fluff setting on this."
2.0,I returned them because they seemed too 3-D ish . They are nice but I felt like they were just too flat on my face and no curvature so they kinda look funny as if they are costume looking.
2.0,The material is not the same as the picture. You can tell it seems more cotton in the pic and it also has lines. This is more silk and not what I had in mind. Also seems a bit shorter. The slit is too high for me. Still cute but not what I wanted.
2.0,Cheaply made... its lasts for 2 months....
2.0,Too Small...had to give it away. Not sized for U.S.
2.0,"After about 1 week of wear, the stone fell out... So disappointed, was beautiful until then."
2.0,Shirt was great but pants are green not khaki and the fact that they are green throws the whole outfit off. I had to buy some nice pants that made the outfit look perfect
2.0,The bill is lopsided and has to ve vent each time I put it on.
2.0,"I have really thin legs and these squeezed at the thigh, it doesn't look attractive when it's squeezed that tightly. otherwise they were fine."
2.0,"Bought these for my teen daughter. she loves the colors and they are warm. Havent used them in the snow yet so not sure how waterproof they are. But still considering returning them because the fingers are very short. The liner inside each finger hole is really strange, if you wiggle your fingers into the hole, you can eventually get them all the way in but its not easy. It's supposed to snow tomorrow, so we will see if they are worth keeping."
2.0,Way too heavy and pulled on ears.
2.0,Supposedly x large was the size but the garment was way too small. Gave to my 12 year old granddaughter and it fit her perfectly. Wears to bed with casual pant. 0808
2.0,Cross is on there Crooked
2.0,These slippers are not the best quality. Fabric is pretty rough and I had to cut off some strings. They are huge though. I added photos with my son's size 8 oshkosh shoes for comparison. Definitely should of ordered a size down.
2.0,It shrinks after the first washing.
2.0,I love the small earrings except they are so tiny I have a hard time getting them in.
2.0,They fit her but the bows fell off extremely easy and they broke quickly she's only 30 pounds
2.0,I liked the fit and feel of the bra but the girls were more mushed together and wasn’t much of a pickup/lift of them. It’s not a “cup” but more of flat elastic band. Might be great for smaller boobs
2.0,cheaply made but a cute shirt. Also the pattern is a little different than what is in the picture.
2.0,This top is about 2 inches shorter than the same size I brought in a store previously
2.0,"Worst of the worst. Too short. More like capri pants or ""pedal pushers"". Worthless"
2.0,Please note that the product is only for one ear. I should have read it carefully before buying and was disappointed when it arrived after a month just as a single piece. It is not very comfortable to wear either.
2.0,These glasses do the job as far as reducing my eye strain. The only problem for me is that they are a bit heavy. My regular glasses are always sliding down. If they could be lighter and the clip less prominent it would be good.<br />Update: I'm posting this update because these did not hold up very well over time. After a few months my pair cracked in the areas where the screws are located on either side of the nose. The right lens now moves around. You have to be gentle when cleaning them. The low price reflects the quality.
2.0,"I bought Big Kid Size 4 for my 10-year old. Size 4 should be roomy on her, but these were too tight. Cheap quality. Soles have ridges for traction, but the material seems like they'd still be slippery. Weird. Returning pronto."
2.0,"I bought this for a Halloween outfit and it served its purpose - it was a little too small for my head so it sort of rested on the very top sector of the crown on my head.<br /><br />It was cheaply made but I expected that.<br /><br />Overrall, good product for one or two nights - but don't expect it to last much longer than that."
2.0,I'm only giving this top a 2 for the fact the color was decently accurate. Other than that though I was really disappointed.  My sons girlfriend is a small in tops and this shirt was somewhat tight on her.  Not only that the sewing was off so the shirt was uneven. Plus a lot of threading was already coming out.  Another thing that didn't help....no tags.  So how does one wash this top?  How do I know it was the right size?  The only thing that said the size was wrinkled/crinkled bag it came in had a generic small white circle sticker that said 2X.  I mean knew it would be small and asian sizing so I ordered bigger just in case but this was ridiculous. The worst thing about the shirt though had to be the unevenness of the sewing.  My sons girlfriend I laughed and laughed at how hilarious this looked.  Looks like someone sewed it with a blindfold on.  I would not recommend this top to anyone and would go elsewhere to find a pretty top.
2.0,Cute dress. I measured myself specifically for this dress and the bust was still way off from the sizing guide.  I will alter it to fit.
2.0,Size large runs small
2.0,"Looks to be of good quality, but the buckle on the strap is silver rather than black as shown in the image. Returned."
2.0,"I bought the dopey dog. i only give this 2 stars because I am desperately trying to be fair. One star for being absolutely adorable. One star for the outside being supremely furry, just as it looks on the photo.it should be a given but especially when buying something furry, plush, fleece etc. Most photos look furry or plush or thick and comfy, and somehow I end up with t-shirt thin, flat, fleece that is nothing like the photo, so looking like the photo In Person is a big deal these days.<br /><br />Here is the problem I have, I bought these as pajamas, to actually wear them on their own to sleep in. They are horrendous inside. They are the raw, itchy, flat, horrible,not fleece, not furry, the raw side of fabric. I truly cannot believe they can get away with charging $50 for an item where the inside is the side that is never meant to touch  persons skin, it is the side you LINE WITH SOMETHING OR YOU DOUBLE THE FABRIC BACK TO BACK. If it was a $20 costume or a cheap cosplay outfit, customers might expect to wear clothes underneath or not care because a cheap Halloween costume is worn for a few hours. BUT PAJAMAS? It is absolutely unbelievable that is is not lined even with something cheap but bearable. I only bought it because it was on sale and I thought I was getting thick fluffy plush dog pajamas that would be snuggly and amazing and cute to sleep in. I basically got a cheap Halloween costume inside, and  fluffy amazing dog pajama outside. I read so many reviews to figure out if it was real true $50 fluffy soft pajamas or a complete ripoff. It's a ripoff. There is no reason or excuse to have the inside be the raw side of fabric without telling the customers, without photos, without warning, unless you are purposely misleading people because you know nobody would spend $50 if they knew the fabric was one sided and the raw side was inside, against your skin, when you are trying to sleep in comfort.<br /><br />I am considering keeping them as a Halloween costume because I got them on sale and they are adorable but I hate for them to keep even a penny of my money when all they had to do was put a photo of the pajamas slightly unzipped and folded open so you can see the inside, it would be obvious to anyone that it is the raw side and then nobody would get ripped off or misled. They would buy it because they only care about the cuteness, or they are wearing clothes underneath anyway, or they would not buy it because it is not what they wanted, like me."
2.0,"looking at the pic, I thought this ring would allow the wearer to rotate the symbols and the letter individually, allowing you to alter the correlation between alphabet and symbols. But that's not the case. It's a spinner ring that has the 'pigpen cypher' printed on it, that's all."
2.0,"ok. So....I don't know what to give these for a rating. I own a boat. I lost a 180$ pair of oakleys last weekend because I jumped in Boston harbor with silicone chums and they came up over my head and they were gone. So I went home and ordered these floating chums. Let me start by saying that these are the most comfortable chums I've ever owned. They are weightless and you don't even know they are there. I've owned the silicone, rope, and cotton chums. These are by far the most comfortable. They allow my Oakley Holbrook shades to float no problem. That being said. THEY DO NOT STAY ON WHATSOEVER IF YOU SWIM OR JUMP IN THE WATER. I jumped in twice and the chums slipped right off of the sunglasses no matter what I did to keep them on. I had to swim back down and watch my SECOND pair of pallets slowly sink in ossippee lake. Fortunately the sun was bright enough I could see them and somehow grabbed them. Crazy. I gave them a 2 star rating due to the fact that they are so comfortable and lightweight. I am going to use heat shrink tubing and permanently secure these to my Sunglasses and just deem them my Boat shades.<br /><br />Please be aware that you CAN NOT jump in the water with these and expect them to stay on. These have been fully field tested and they are garbage without a buyer modification to get these to stay on."
2.0,Unfortunately the product arrived with about 1/4 of the shells broken and almost to a dust! Have to return. So bummed! Not worth the price especially because you can get these elsewhere.
2.0,Smaller than expected. Flimsy
2.0,I loved these at first but they became green too quickly… not worth the buy
2.0,My daughter ripped the middle of this outfit like in 20 minutes. so disappointing because it was so cute until then. Oh well what can ya do. I felt the size was appropriate so I'm not sure what went wrong.
2.0,The black and Gray were perfect. The green came with two holes in the bottom hem :(
2.0,The band was cute and comfortable but broke within a month of purchasing.
2.0,"I ordered the tall, my husband is 6'5"", the pants had been lengthened by sewing about 2"" cuff on the bottom, but the sleeves hit him like a 3/4 length sleeve."
2.0,"Clipped up just right to my radars. Work as well as the stock glasses that they replaced. Updated from 5 to 2 stars. Product lasted a few months before the tinting delaminated and became useless. For the price it's a toss up, Oakley brand lenses normally last me 2 years or so..... Going back to Oakley."
2.0,"The band looks great, but the clip that lets you adjust the length.... does not hold so every time you put it on you have to readjust it and it creeps longer and longer.......  I would not buy this particular one again."
2.0,"Looks nothing like the photo. Cheap fabric,. The gold ribbon looks bad and the bows in the front are awful."
2.0,Execution is bad. Actual product fit is not as elegant as advertised.
2.0,"These slippers were very soft but extremely wide,  even for my wide feet. I had to return them."
2.0,It was broken when I received in the mail
2.0,"Very small, ended up giving to my girlfriends granddaughter.  She was very happy with it.t"
2.0,Within the first day of my 7 yr old granddaughter wearing these shoes to school..the sole came out if the shoe…now less than a week later…the purple sole has come detached from the sole! I just purchased these and they are falling apart!
2.0,"These shoes are the loudest things ever the squeak so bad ill not wear them again, they r comfortable but can't get past the squeak!"
2.0,The lining under the dress is crooked - poorly made and the quality isn’t there.
2.0,Doe snot provide heat to the palm side of your thumb and fingers. Does a good job keeping the back of your hands warm at 15 above 0 .
2.0,Ripped a hole in one pair trying to put them on.
2.0,"I thought this would be a cute cheaper alternative to some of the slightly more expensive watches (Cluse perhaps?). However, the watch face was absolutely huge; it was awkward and bulky on my wrists, which are, admittedly, on the more petite size. I ended up giving up on this brand, despite the adorable aesthetic they offer, and just purchased the Cluse watches I had my eye on originally. They are also rather big on my wrist also, but they aren't as thick and bulky, and feel much nicer to wear."
2.0,The set is very cute upon opening the box but the shirt runs very small! After washing it one time the image on the hoodie cracked horribly
2.0,"Although this shirt is well made with quality fabric, its fit resembles a hospital scrub shirt; almost like a potato sack with a belt—and I ordered the small."
2.0,When I received the handbag the strap was missing.
2.0,"Although  I primarily bought this for the Kunai, and saw this little pack I thought would be cool. They were just way too small for anything. Also the metal on the headband is very weak and flexible, and bent very badly trying to fit it to my head. Overall the the kunai are good I just wish it was bigger, and looked more like they pictures they have of them."
2.0,The color was supposed to be a navy blue and it absolutely is not. It’s very much so a deep purple. Not at all what I was after. Quality of the dress seems good. Hasn’t been worn due to the color.
2.0,stretches and brakes
2.0,My husband and I ordered these to replace our wedding bands...but they are not as rounded as we thought from the picture. Very uncomfortable.<br />He wanted a wide band and wanted them to match but I think this particular ring is not for a woman and he didn't like it either. Too uncomfortable on finger. Good company though. Very fast shipping. Just wish the rings were more rounded.
2.0,cheap material and thin.  i ordered several in diff colors but now regret it. will spend more to get better quality.  like they say &#34;you get what you pay for&#34;
2.0,I have had them for less than one month and the lenses have begun to show discoloration after a few trips to the beach
2.0,2stars
2.0,TOO NARROW
2.0,"If you have an average or curvy waist, DONT BUY, the shorts are meant for a really flat butt, gives you no room."
2.0,"Don't waste your money.  This visor hat is a bit big and came as flat as a pancake.  There is no structure to it so when you wear it, it doesn't look like the picture.  You have to keep shaping it over and over again and again."
2.0,"Cute, but it arrived broken. I will either have to find some glue and try to put it back together, or return."
2.0,"I was excited about this dress, but disappointed when it came. It fit fine, and wasn't too tight in the bust (which happens for me sometimes), but even so the buttons in the chest area were coming out of the buttonholes even after less than 10 minutes of normal movement. I'll be returning the item."
2.0,"My daughter ordered this and it was way too big!  She's really bummed because its a well made, nice looking cover up, but will have to send back because its too big. She is about 5'6 and 120 lbs."
2.0,The style is cute but it didn't fit well to where my waist is and I'm proportioned well. Plus had extra gathering at shoulder
2.0,Waaay to big! But at least I have many extra filters & valves.
2.0,"I literally just received these pants almost an hour ago from typing this. I waited by my window for this shipment, as I'm rushing to secure my attire for a funeral. As soon as I opened the pkg I was in disbelief. Like, really this is a joke right?! My waist/hip measurements are 36-45 and I am roughly 215lbs. So I chose the Large, hoping that the waist band would be fairly snug, and there would be a decent fitting around my hips/butt.<br /><br />THESE ARE CLOWN PANTS! They fit more along the ""palazzo"" side, and definitely do not give you a polished fit and wide leg flare. These are wide from top to bottom. They were sliding down my waist... no snug fit. The Adilaca chart indicated a Large to accommodate a ""30"" waist and ""39"" inch hip circumference in INCHES. I could care less about the length I was prepared to alter those accordingly if need be.<br /><br />I've given 2 stars, for the decent shipping window. The material is soft and has a fair weight. They don't seem to be ""cheap"" looking at all. However, it appears that I could've truly ordered 2-3 sizes DOWN to achieve a look similar to the model where they contour to the body better at the top. So this very misleading sizing chart has inconvenienced me during a rough time at present. I didn't want to take a picture in these things; I slid them off immediately and grabbed my packaging to submit a refund."
2.0,"Love the look and style of this boot but it runs very small. I'm usually a size 9 so got the 10 after reading it ran small. So I expected them to run small but not this small. I would say the size 10 is more like a 7 or 8. Also, if you have even the slightest height on your in-step, good luck getting it on your foot."
2.0,"I didn't expect this to be real fancy for the price, but it looks like something out if a gumball machine. Not something that's $40."
2.0,"Nice material, but ridiculously small."
2.0,"Not well made.  The concept design was great, though.  Had to return it."
2.0,"I bought this shirt in yellow & blue, as I was super excited. Imagine my disappointment when they arrive and are basically see through. Overall, the shirts look very cheap and look like they will fall apart in the first wash. I will be returning mine."
2.0,"The snaps didn't hold, batteries were down, I was able to repair 2 but the rest didn't work at all, disappointing. Seller didn't respond to my email as of yet."
2.0,La verdad esperaba que fuera más delgado en cuanto al grueso de la caja pero es como cualquiera  lástima!!!<br />Y tiene defecto en el broche ya que el primero se bota y es solo con el segundo ya cierra hay que tener cuidado de que no se suelte.<br />Por lo tanto no se siente seguridad al usarlo<br />Al estar en México se me complica y es costoso devolverlo de lo contrario ya lo habría devuelto
2.0,"The center spring of the band (the little black ""dash"" part that slides onto the watch face) broke on two of the bands! Great colors, just not good quality."
2.0,I like the feel of the fabric but the color was off.  More gray than green floral print.  Also it is very short.
2.0,"Beads do not have holes in them, can not string them to use as jewelry pendant."
2.0,"No give to this dress, If you are busty this won’t fit. It’s cute but it’s that fabric that I feel like will just turn into a wrinkled mess once you wash it."
2.0,It was a lot smaller than I expected......
2.0,"Works great to hold your cards and cash, but good luck carrying it in your pocket. There are so many sharp edges and corners it hurts your leg when you sit down."
2.0,"They claim to be leather belt, it is not, it is coated with vinyl coating to  look like leather . The coating ing is peeling. I will not recommend this product to anyone ."
2.0,It’s very cheap looking fabric with white stitching :(
2.0,I love the sweater but I ordered the khaki and received a purple sweater instead. It is quite pretty for the price but hate the color so I will return mine.
2.0,"Ok so I loved these when I first received them. I the lace allows more flexibility and makes them more comfortable and a better fit then other little socks like these. But then I washed them and now they are to small and hurt my feet. I really love them, but now want to throw them out!"
2.0,Cute but lasted two minutes and then fell apart
2.0,"It broke the first night I wore it. Disappointed because it looks groovy, but it's cheap."
2.0,"Great for guy with a big belly but not a guy that works out. Ordered an XL but this shirt brand seems to be a big and sloppy XL, more for a fat guy than a guy that's built well. Bummer."
2.0,This dress runs big I got a medium it fits and looks like an XL. Not a fan of the shoulder pads.
2.0,"I was so excited to gift this to my sister who had recently purchased an Apple Watch. It arrived on time but when it did, the quality was horrible. The plasticky material cracked and left deep groves in the cheetah pattern as I wrapped it around my wrist. Looked very cheap and worn. I returned it immediately"
2.0,I got this during a lightening deal and saw that they had a lot of good reviews. Initially I had liked it because it doesn't pill when you wash it several times. But I find myself feeling really warm while running with these on. Not so breathable.
2.0,"Cheap, plastic-feeling material. I feel like I would sweat in these and would not enjoy wearing them. Not great quality."
2.0,"If you really want to know what these earrings look like the photo is all you'll get.  They are very, very small.  I believe too small for an adult woman."
2.0,"Tad different than in the photo above but it is comfortable, fabric isn't soft but not scratchy either. Color is faded and not vibrant. Will only be keeping it because my husband likes it."
2.0,Tela barata... se estiró...<br /><br />Bendiciones 🙌🏽
2.0,"This would be a great blouse; however, the material is like a smock you wear when getting your hair done. I sent it back."
2.0,Definitely size up. Not that stretchy  and was short on me ( I’m 5’3”
2.0,Product is nice but the pictures are so streched out they look crappy
2.0,Broke immediately 😭
2.0,"This is supposedly an XXL sized pajama size, however, it fits more like a M to L. The shorts are extremely tight at the waist and an awkward length (mid knee). The shirt is extremely short and tight. It has to be a size Medium. It is short and also, not flattering. The sizing is way off. I am a L-XL in sizes so I thought this would be baggy, Instead it is tight and unflattering."
2.0,"I wish it has pockets. The quality is very good and it looks really gorgeous, but without pockets, it is useless for me. Sorry."
2.0,"After reading the reviews, I really wanted this top: a turtleneck that was loose almost like a cowl. I also ordered the size that I could determine from the size chart and the other reviewers. I am SO bummed: this top is unflattering and too tight, although the turtleneck was cowl-like and comfortable. I wear a size 18 right now (added weight the last few years, sigh), and I ordered an XXL. I am so disappointed in this top. However, seeing what I looked like in this top (like a size too small!), I am motivated to get some of this weight off so I can go shopping in my own closet. Therefore, I am keeping this top, because I DO love the cowl-like turtleneck, and the material is soft and a bit thin, but not see-through. If you are a size 12 or 14, you could wear this top in the XXL. If you are a curvy woman like me, you can wear this top. If you are an apple-body, with your weight in the middle, this might not be very flattering on you, unless you got a larger size than you would normally."
2.0,Good quality but they don't stay up.. I have pretty big calves and these leg warmers don't astay up on theem very well. They stretch out very easily.
2.0,"Bought this same dress in another color in a large and it fit perfectly, but when I got this dress the sizing was totally off.  I had to send it back because it was too small.  The quality was good though and I really like the other color I got."
2.0,im super skinny 5'4&#34; 105 and this was really tight around the waist line
2.0,Mala calidad. Se daño en un par de meses
2.0,"Fit well height-wise (I’m 5’7”). Though, if you’re curvier around the mid section, the middle of this jumper will balloon around you like a circle from front and side views (not the most flattering). The material kinda sucks; it’s thin and the straps get twisted around easily. Cute look, I just wish it were more impressive."
2.0,"After one use, these became loose."
2.0,Could not go outside with them they did not keep water out.
2.0,"Took ages to receive and are NOT 2.0 glasses.  I don't know what they are but they are blurry and distorted, with no magnification that was discernible. Yet there was a sticker with 2.0 on them. The frame was attractive so I'll give credit for that."
2.0,Put these in my bag and two out of the three pair got scratched
2.0,"I know everybody's face is different, but they don't stay up.  I ran across other people with the same problem with this type of mask.  I cut one in half, then at the band, I made slits to let my ears hold it up.  Works now, but I didn't have to spend the money for something to be refashioned by me."
2.0,inexpensive made and the logo on the bottom is just too much
2.0,Got the correct size for 6 month old and it was huge.
2.0,"returned ruuns small even though i ordered sizes larger ,reordered"
2.0,I got these right away which was great. I love the look but was a little disappointed in how they wear.  The sides of the glasses are already ripping. They have some kind of white rubber on them and I only wore them three tones and it is already coming  off.
2.0,The chains are way too long and did not allow for a snug fit
2.0,"Not real brand, very knock off save your money"
2.0,Cups in bra were very small and I ordered recommended size.
2.0,"Definitely like how the shoes look and feel. The are a bit shug at first but feel like your walking on air. Now the bad: After 2 months of indoor use, the cushing is fells like there is none. Just completely gone flat. Then at 4 months of use, the bottom of the shoes have ripped open."
2.0,"Beautiful but the ""stones"" fell out within the week I got it 💔"
2.0,"This dress was a disappointment, the upper part is thin and scratchy cotton/poly and the bottom is a thin greasy feeling polyester.  Yuck.  Would have been great if the fabric wasn't so cheap.  Top lines weren't even either where it's sewn to the skirt.  Returned."
2.0,"I was seriously so excited for these boots they are extremely cute, however when I receive them the color of the sole was an awful yellow color (even worse then showing in the picture). I ordered the tan so maybe a different color would be different but I returned these. They looked so fake and the color did not match the picture at all. I tried them on and they fit perfect, but I I can’t say how well they would hold up. I only put them on for a second because I knew I was going to return them once I saw them. I’m pretty bummed. You might have better luck with a different color."
2.0,I should have returned it.
2.0,"Bought these for a 6 year old, and the seams promptly ripped in all three pair. I would not buy these again."
2.0,"I'm a US 16-18, ordered the 3X...they pants fight go past my knees. However, the outfit was very cute...nice quality & value for the money."
2.0,I really like the look of these glasses.  It took some work to try to get them to fit comfortably.  I didn't really get to wear them to see how they worked because I had to return them because the lens was scratched when I got them.
2.0,"We tried writing on it with the light provided, in the dark. Even with going slow and multiple times over the same line, it is so faint that you can barely see any lines. You can’t draw on it. Nice idea but doesn’t work… it’s a nice shirt but I could’ve gotten a nice shirt for much cheaper without this feature that doesn’t work."
2.0,"I had high hopes for this dress, but sadly I was let down. It’s tight in the butt area but superrr loose in the stomach area to the point of being unflattering.<br /><br />Plus, my white dress came with makeup (looks like foundation) stains all over it like it had previously been worn."
2.0,"The arms were SO tight, the body was really wide, and flared out in such a strange angle that the top where the neckline is fit very tight, and tight across the chest, and then went very wide.  Just not flattering in any way shape or form.  I had such high hopes.  I have heavy arms and a smaller chest just fyi.  It could possibly be me but it certainly wasn't for the fluffy pear shape."
2.0,"The material was extremely itchy and crunchy, and the neckline was way too tight with no adjusting abilities. I gave it to stars because at least the sleeves were long, but it was extremely uncomfortable."
2.0,The jacket itself is very nice but is very small. I purchased the largest one and it still didn’t fit me quite right. If you don’t mind it clinging to your every curve it’s fine. The fit was the only problem I had with it
2.0,"Not a fan of the material its is very thin and cheap feeling. The shorts come up high but the waist band is about 1.5in in width so it doesn't flatter your waist, it just sort of cuts into you. I would wear them around the house for light exercise, but not out/at the gym"
2.0,Though the fit was great and the color is pretty; it truly is a nice dress. It is however very itchy around the arm and neckline. It's the sequins that were irritating my skin within seconds of trying it on. I would have no use for it and would never wear it for more than a few seconds so I have to return it unfortunately.
2.0,"I have only worn one pair once. These socks are slippery to wear on smooth surfaces like laminate floors and linoleum.  I slipped shortly after putting them on and twisted my knee. Also, they are a little too tight for the size that they say they are. I will probably return them."
2.0,No instructions very difficult to read can’t set the clock
2.0,Made small size up! Other than that super cute
2.0,Thin silky material without any support or lifting. It’s all in the pants & they do look cute however they don’t fit well. They are tight or workout material. Feels like a silky pair of tight pajama bottoms.
2.0,Change color within a day's .
2.0,This material looks and feels very cheap (it's almost shiny). The straps are also very awkward and fall down constantly. I would not recommend this at all.
2.0,"These are kind of flimsy, thought they would be thicker."
2.0,"This is different from the description, which does not work."
2.0,UDPATE: I wore the black one today and it got this run around 2 inches long around the crotch area 😣 very disappointed! Gonna take out two stars for the rating coz of that run. See attached photo.<br /><br />First review: Love these leggings 😊they are thick and warm ( getting ready for fall and winter this product will definitely won’t disappoint you )<br /><br />For reference: I’m 5ft tall around 167 lbs; fits perfectly
2.0,Item too large and the neckline droops.
2.0,Not true to chart.<br />Runs about 2 sizes smaller.
2.0,it looks really good but it tore with in the first hour of wering it
2.0,"I bought these for my girlfriend. These were great for a couple of wears. They fit well and as a server, she was able to move around easily. However after one wash the elastic in the seams began to show. The little bits of plastic are so obvious against the black pant. :("
2.0,Very thin and very skimpy. The are soft though. Good to wear to bed. Not in public.
2.0,It doesn't fit the snake chain Pandora bracelet.
2.0,"The cool patterns made these a hit at Christmas. They were so cool that the recipient initially wanted to display them rather than wear them.  Stupid Mommy told him to wear the socks because that is what they are for. On his third time wearing them, the holes started to appear. The high price is, I am sure, for image licensing, not quality of materials."
2.0,"At 5'8, 196lbs this does nothing for my figure but show off the shape of my legs.<br />Originally I purchased the Large, but it was too tight. I replaced it with an XL, which accommodates my thighs but now everything I loved about this romper is missing. It just hangs on my body. I do not like the way it fits. Returning it today."
2.0,"This product was not as advertised. It was not a WOMEN'S XL as it was labeled at all. I actually had to insert 3"" panels on either side to get some Wear for my money."
2.0,These gloves were old or just poorly made. The gloves were sticking together like they were glued together as we pull them out of the box. They work but they were in bad condition.
2.0,Not as sturdy as I would like. The band under the armpit is thin so it gets caught in my back fat. I don’t if other women care about that. I find myself adjusting more than I would like. I got a bra from<br />Dollar General that is sturdier.
2.0,I thought maybe it would be normal. But no. What you see in the pic is the snook pointing upwards. Don't like it and disappointed.
2.0,The earrings  are pretty just wish they weren't so thick . I feel like they  sit to high up on the earlobe . They would been perfect if not for that  !!!
2.0,The lenses fit the frames correctly but I noticed after a few months of owning them that regular light use has caused the blue finish to rub off in a few places.
2.0,The dress is pretty but the material is like loose fitting and doesn’t stand
2.0,"I like them but, they are flimsy and not stress balls just on there and you have to match them up. Not a good quality product."
2.0,Poor Quality and fit
2.0,"i did not like this very much, i ordered a style too big for me but i didnt feel it was flattering at all. the fabric felt little cheap to me and see through"
2.0,"Ordered an XL to accomodate for chest size. The lower torso area was ok... But the chest and armpit area was WAY too tight.<br />The fabric isn't too sheer, but I definitely wouldn't recommend a colored bra of any kind, not even white, beneath it. Otherwise it's pretty easy to see the white bra against the color of your skin, even for someone as pale as me.<br /><br />So wear a bra that closely matches your skin tone and don't even bother ordering if you're above a C cup."
2.0,I returned this. I gave it two stars because its cute but It made me want to pull my hair out!!! Worst design ever trying to get n e thing out of it or back in it. I really wanted a backpack/purse and the design of the backpack is horrible. The strap goes through one loop and I looked like an idiot everytime I'd try and put it on.
2.0,I wish they came with more vowels and the more commonly used letters. I was told by the seller they’re not able to accommodate certain letters being in each package.
2.0,"This is October 6 I am noticing the opening, closing of bracelet is weakened Soo I am Greatly Concerned. I See I am A day over return time.It's Friday night, Will be speaking w Maker ASAP!!!"
2.0,I bought the 4-6 medium size. The cups were really small (between and A-B cup) and coverage was really poor.
2.0,The material is so thin and so sheer that you cannot wear it on its own.
2.0,feels way to tall on your haed
2.0,I sized up 2 sizes and this top still didn't fit<br /> There just isn't enough material. You can't sell a 3x or 4x item and skimp on the coverage material. I waited way too long to return it so I'm stuck with it.  But the design and colors are amazingly beautiful.
2.0,It’s cute but very thin material
2.0,The emblem slides . My husband is not a fan of this one
2.0,this purple nightshirt is actually much more blue looking. very disappointed
2.0,"Material is nice, craftsmanship unfortunately not.<br />Not only is the buckle mounted at an angle, but you cant even use the ""reversal"" feature since part of where the belt is secured to it is ""offset"" and it will push into your stomach.<br /><br />print on the box feels like sarcasm... : YOUR BEST CHOICE"
2.0,"i get this item and it was too large, and when i open the package on that jacket was a size mark.. and i cant remove this mark."
2.0,"I wanted to like these trekking poles. They were light, folded into a compact size, looked good and had multiple tip ends and baskets.  It was easy to adjust the lengths and  ruler markings on the poles made it is easy to make the poles equal.  However, they did not work.  One of the poles no matter how secure I locked it, would not stay locked into place and each time I put any pressure down through the pole, it would slip and shorten. The other pole kept coming apart at one of the joints.  So each time I lifted the pole, it would come apart. No matter what I did as soon as I lifted it, it would pull apart and the bottom part of the pole would be dangling by the string.  Unfortunately, both poles were defective with different problems and I returned them."
2.0,"I was not impressed at all.  I ordered the purple one and it had a very shiny fake plastic look. I was rather disappointed. Yes my phone, a galaxy 6, fits in it but it looks so tacky that I never used it. The zippers stick on the track which makes it annoying to open, and concerning."
2.0,I followed the measurement guidelines and it still was extremely small.
2.0,It was disappointing that the plaid fabric was not matched up at the back seem.
2.0,This dress is so much smaller than expected.  I ordered a size larger than I normally would and it's just entirely too small.
2.0,Looks great but has started losing time and date even after changing the battery. Do not recommend
2.0,"Cheap looking, gave to goodwill"
2.0,"This China-made watch has a contrived German name and a cheesy back story about it's &#34;heritage.&#34; However - the timepiece does indeed look the business. Even true Germans like it!  It has a weighty, premium feel and polished good looks, reminiscent of a late, 1990s TAG-Heuer, or Breitling Navitimer. The rotating bezel and tri-dial watch faces are all working like they should.<br /><br />Believe it or not - this watch replaces a 9-year-old Swatch Irony Chrono Quartz. I simply got sick of the fast battery drain (11 batteries used!). I wanted an inexpensive, mechanical automatic for under $40. Let's hope this one lasts more than one year. I'll keep you updated!<br /><br />04/11/2018 UPDATE: Crown snapped at the tiny shaft, rendering watch completely useless now. AVOID...."
2.0,The seams that are supposed to add support end up just irritating. wish there was a liner.
2.0,Runs small what ever your normal size is go up 2.
2.0,The shirt is a nice gray. The collar and sleeves hem lessons the look of the shirt. It looks cheap and for the house. No extra accent stitching really cheapened the look. Fits nice though.
2.0,"the black one was a good fit, but the blue one wasn't, they are both the same size"
2.0,Sizes run extremely small. Material and detail was good.
2.0,"The shoes are adorable, good quality and vibrant colors. Seems to be comfortable for my toddler. But only one shoe lights up! She was devastated!"
2.0,"The picture of the product makes it look like it is made of metal, but it's really just a cheap plastic..."
2.0,Bottoms fit well but the top keyhole area showed a lot of cleavage.  Ended up being unwearable!
2.0,"Gee I don't know what people are talking about.<br /><br />I ordered a size up and they were gigantic.<br />I'm 5ft1 & 110 lbs. I have decently thick thighs, calves, and a butt. I'm petite with some curve and ordering a size up was way too huge. :-( I asked my husband if it was just me and he said ""Nope, those are giant on you"".<br /><br />I'd say they run true to size. It's just if you are a taller girl your proportions are probably different in ways that make these not the right fit on you.<br /><br />I'm basically Asian sized and ordering up was a bad idea!<br /><br />If you're a shorty and anywhere between 90-110 lbs these are true to size"
2.0,"This khaki-colored jacket is a beautiful color and I loved the look of it; it's also soft.<br /><br />But it's tight-fitting in the shoulders and arms (though roomy enough in the chest and tummy area), which made it mildly - though not intolerably - uncomfortable. If I were to wear a short-sleeve (or no-sleeve) top, I would have worn the jacket anyway.<br /><br />The jacket was deeply wrinkled when it arrived, but I washed it immediately and hung it to dry. None of the wrinkles loosened - and it's wrinkled everywhere - arms, front, back, inside - an iron couldn't completely erase the wrinkles because they seemed to be too deeply creased into the material. I was very disappointed - even for casual wear, it's just too wrinkled to wear."
2.0,The material is unattractive and fits larger than looks flattering.
2.0,"I wanted to love this dress, but it just doesn’t fit me right. I am a 42” bust and a 45” hip, and I’m 5’8” tall. I ordered the XL (my usual size). This did not fit my bust right at all. The empire waist seam ran across my bust instead of under, and the darts in the bust were way high and formed these weird dimples in the fabric above my bust—not at all where they should have been. According to the size chart, I should have ordered a large, but if the XL had the waist running across the bust, where would it have been in a smaller size?<br /><br />The dress is stitched well, the hems finished. The fabric is light and soft, and I like the texture of it. I like the style of the dress, but I think it must be best suited to those with smaller figures."
2.0,"I wanted to give this product a 1 star at 1st. But 6 of the 8 earrings are actually nice so I bumped it up to a 2 star. When I received my order I had 7 pairs of earring apparently they didn't send the other earring to make the 8th pair. Than also these are NOT all clip on, 1 pair is for pierced ears. Hope this helps anyone thinking about ordering these."
2.0,I had such high hopes for this watch. Sadly I had to return the watch 5 minutes after opening the box! The minute and hour hands were loose. If you tilted the watch side to side they shifted .02&#34; (.50mm) forward or backward. This is a deal breaker for me. A watches movements should be solid. Excess backlash in the movement will progressively get worse from impact/shock during normal wearing. Another issue unrelated to the defect is the length of the wrist straps. They are too short for a watch this size. They are at least an 1&#34; shorter than the ones on my G-Shock. I could only engage the 3rd to last hole for it to fit comfortably. The excess strap barely fits into the securing loop on the opposite strap and looked weird because it was so short.
2.0,"There's a weird bunching of fabric around the waistband area due to the poor quality of fabric. by design it wrinkles running vertically, which looks nice but there's also lot of wrinkles running horizontally, which makes the pants look poor in quality and cheap. However, it's not as noticeable on black."
2.0,"I love the design of this ring, unfortunately the bad definitely outweighs good. The ring was uncomfortable to wear. Also the screws and outside edge are sharp I've cut myself with it several times also this ring should only be worn by a guy with baseball mits size hands otherwise it looks silly since it is so bulky. Also the headline says 10mm and item discription say 9mm it confusing. I will be returning. I was really looking forward to getting it just disappointed."
2.0,Think the headline says it all.
2.0,Quality of the fabric seems to be below that of competitors charging a bit more.  The extra charge would be worth it.
2.0,I should not of expected more. It is trash it lasted about a day then started to lose digits then went completely blank. then was sporadic<br />until it quit all together.<br /> regards GMF
2.0,Screw came out already on tge lense by the nose area. Bummer.
2.0,Order a size up!! It shrunk after the first wash!
2.0,"It doesn't look as pictured, and the material is a weird nylon fabric, basically like stretchy leggings."
2.0,"These were a gift, 1st day she wore it the ""string"" holding it all together broke.  It was a winner till then.  You need to step up the string material."
2.0,"Just a big net to hold your breasts. No shape or support. The band doesn't move so it keeps you up,  but then the cups really don't do anything to create a shape."
2.0,As a Teamster I like the design.  The mask is too small and too thin. Wrong material
2.0,"Pretty but GINORMOUS.  If it were half or a quarter of the size it might be wearable, but at this size, no way.  Not for me."
2.0,"The lenses are not matched; that is, one eye sees one thing but that same object is offset in the other eye. The result is they give you a fake ""3D"" effect that is very disorienting. Objects seem further away than they should and due to the lenses not matching your brain can get confused. I use these for cycling and they make me feel like I'm several feet further off the ground than I am.<br /><br />They are also quite dark. Now, if you're using them to read a book in bright sunlight, this is probably great. However, I got them to see my iPhone in daylight and they are so dark I really can't read it. Thus they haven't really solved the problem they were bought for.<br /><br />Dear manufacturer:  I'm willing to pay more for these if you can upgrade them with lenses that match each other and that are a bit less dark. As it stands, I can't recommend them."
2.0,Not very flattering since it was big in me.
2.0,"Very soft, but the color is nothing like charcoal - it is a light grey"
2.0,"Cute, but incredibly tiny.  I’m average sized and this wasn’t even close to fitting properly."
2.0,The Pearl on this necklace doesn't line up properly with the clasp so it never lays right on the neck.. waste of money.
2.0,REALLY SMALL
2.0,I am not a fan of the material or the awful chemical smell.... I've washed it a few times so it doesn't smell as bad but I haven't even worn it out once after the first time I tried it on.... maybe I will grow to like it or give it away.
2.0,I ordered my size but it doesnt fit me.. it still big for me..
2.0,"These are not very dark lenses, the eye cups indent at the nose bridge a bit, but mostly the polarization has a strange effect where it almost feels like there's a prescription in it. Polarized lenses always make screens & water look strange, but this does a slight distortion that's a bit off-putting. That said, they look cute on - I have a small face so I often buy kids glasses."
2.0,"Poorly made. Couldn’t use as a gift, but will be warm to someone after donating to Salvation Army"
2.0,Cute but terrible fit.
2.0,"Bought this lightweight shirt for my husband and while the material is light it is definitely not a 3x, More like an XL. It is also short. I will keep it and use it as a pajama shirt or give it to our youngest son. Definitely order a few sizes up and I don’t recommend for anyone taller."
2.0,Returned .  I should have paid closer attention to the minimum length.  They were too long for me.  I was really disappointed because I liked everything else about them.
2.0,"The first time I went to try it on, as I was unbuttoning the back, the button fell off :(  Fits nice but very unhappy with the quality."
2.0,"I like the look of them, and they feel good quality, but unfortunately, I can't get them past my thighs. I can normally wear a 10-12 size jean, the page says that the size on these runs large, so I got a medium. They are TINY. I think even if I ordered a large they would not fit. Might end up ordering again to get the right size once I return them, but we'll see."
2.0,The hat is an odd shape (that looks odd on or off the head) and the graphic itself is very cheap and plastic-y looking. For the price though it’s worth 2 stars
2.0,Very unflattering. It didn’t fit well on my frame. Returned it.
2.0,They run very small and I was very disappointed
2.0,Look just like the picture. Finger stitching started falling apart the 1st week. Opened right up.
2.0,There is a hole in them right of the package
2.0,Fit is ok. However they don't hold you junk in place making them very uncomfortable also going to very embarrassed if my work ever checks the video constantly having to readjust
2.0,"I ordered a S since said unisex sizing, S was too small and I’m a 5’7” female 125lbs, I’d order a size up. No returns available either"
2.0,Hoodie is not us sizes
2.0,"The mask is very dark and flimsy. Based on the image, I thought the mask was going to be a hard, sturdy plastic. I never intended to wear the mask, I was going to display it as a decoration. This mask cannot be displayed because it’s so flimsy and soft. It is also much darker than it looks in the image, the colors are NOWHERE near as bright. The image posted is edited to make the colors vibrant. The actual mask does not look like this.<br /><br />Do not buy if you intend to hang it up or display it. It’s too dark and flimsy for that."
2.0,Didn't like very uncomfortable still haven't worn them..
2.0,sizes run very small
2.0,"Received these a few days ago and took the opportunity to wear them yesterday. The material is firm, but not uncomfortable. The biggest issue I had was with the thong; it rubbed between my toes when I tried to have the flip flops seat appropriately. When wearing them, they naturally want to pull so that the heel of the flip flop is out from where my hell naturally sits on the shoe. It is this way with both flip flops. This has never been an issue with any other flip flop I've owned. Hopefully these will break in a bit and not rub on my toes, and I will update my review accordingly."
2.0,"He loves them, but his socks are now brown, thanks to the slippers.  He's been wearing them for several hours, after receiving this afternoon and he just said &#34;look at my feet&#34;, so I did, his white socks are brown, the total foot (feets?) from the lining, we think.  Too bad, since he really likes them and they are comfortable, but I think they'll be returned.  :-(  This is the same style he's gotten for the past years, but these are a fail."
2.0,I ordered this same shirt in gray and the black one fit much tighter. It feels a size smaller when I purchased it a size bigger than my last one.
2.0,The fit was fine and the print was lovely however the elastic waist band came halfway up my boobs.
2.0,"Cheap material, really short for my fellow tall girls"
2.0,didn't realize the product was so small
2.0,"I liked the colors, but the sizes were varied. Some were so small that they barely fit on my head, much less able to put my hair in it too. Some were were big and some were barely big enough to get my hair in. I like the ones that fit. I just wish that they had all fit."
2.0,Some were smaller than others like seconds
2.0,Sizing is small. I ordered a medium and they fit too small.
2.0,"They look as pictured and are super cute but I couldn't for the love of me get these to stay in my ears. The screw threads strip from the soft plastic almost immediately and they are so light they would just fall right out of my ears without me even noticing. I lost one ear each from two pairs, both within the first two or three times wearing them out. Also, the little black elastics popped off constantly, I recommend super gluing them on."
2.0,"When the product arrived, it was placed in a cold wash on delicate to just rinse it out before wearing it, and then hung to dry.  After it was dry, I put in on and went to the store for groceries.  As I went to remove my cell from the front pocket, I looked down and the top seam on the front pocket was partially dangling because the treading had untied and was coming apart.  I went home and re-tacked it myself, but wont trust the seams until I can re-tack them all.  If I had wanted a sewing project, I would have gone to Johann&#34;s Fabrics."
2.0,The shirt fit fine but the shorts was to small
2.0,I thought it was cheap looking.
2.0,It was thinner and smaller than most masks.
2.0,I was really excited to find a pair of patterned floral leggings when they fell apart after the first wear.
2.0,This was not worth the money. It looked cheap felt cheap and ran small. That’s what I get for last minute shopping online.
2.0,Had high hopes for this. The fit was horrible.  I think I have an average size male head.  This thing was way to big.  It says it has a face mask.  Well it doesn’t come close to covering your mouth.  Back it went.
2.0,"The material was too thin for me to wear as a top. I would have kept it and worn it as sleepwear. However, it arrived with two stains so I returned it"
2.0,They are not durable. One has broke all ready. Would not purchase again.
2.0,"No adult male could wear this watch - the band is soooo short I had to use the last hole or two to secure it.<br />And I have skinny wrists.<br />Amazon must know this is a screwy-sized watch for 2 reasons. 1. They gave me a refund and told me not to even return a $20+ watch. 2. One of the drop-down choices for ""reason to return"" was ""Too small""."
2.0,Is NOT as long as photo shows
2.0,"Note: I did wash these before wearing them.<br /><br />This is, I think, my 4th time ordering these shirts, as my current ones are finally starting to show their age. They last a long time so its been about 5 years since I last ordered them, but I've been rotating the same 4 shirts 5 days a week this entire time and they've held up fantastically.<br /><br />I've been wearing these for 5 years under my work polo. I work primarily outdoors doing a physical job that get gets me pretty hot/sweaty in the summer time, these shirts worked perfect as an undershirt. It really sucks that ASICS changed manufacturer. All my shirts say made in El Salvador, the new ones say made in Mexico.<br /><br />The biggest change that has ruined these shirts for me, they used to have a slick/silky texture to them. Both the old and new version are 100% poly, but the new one feels like sand paper by comparison. This makes it less ideal as an undershirt. And even though the size/shirt pattern seem identical, maybe this is related to my first problem, this new shirt has very little stretch to it. The original allowed you to tuck it in and be able to swing your arms up and it had enough elasticity to not untuck itself, but now it feels so rigid. And less of an issue, but the seams used to be flush/almost invisible and you hardly noticed them, now they're external and look crude.<br /><br />Tl;dr: Original version was so comfortable and flexible you forgot you were wearing it, a perfect undershirt. New version feels like you're wearing a paper grocery bag."
2.0,The coat looks completely different in person than it does on the model picture. It's very light and not very warm. The fabric looks a little cheap. I'm returning this coat
2.0,The dress was more like a costume instead of a formal dress. The price should have been my clue. Very poor quality.
2.0,I bought a double XXL.  I like shirts loose and free flowing. One wash and it shrunk a size.
2.0,"The dress is very cute, but I ordered a size 8 and its more like a 4t. I'm going to give is to my niece.  I was super bummed."
2.0,"I purchased this product for my son who plays basketball. I thought by purchasing a size larger it would be fine,  but it was still too tight for my son. I will not purchase again unless I order in advance so I can exchange for a larger size and exchange in a timely manner."
2.0,Very cool looking but it was already partially broken when I got it- can't wear so I use it as a decoration..think before buying anything this cheap
2.0,"I Loved these boots! Thé were so comfortable and fabulous to look at…. But the two colors I purchased each fell apart in less than two months at the sole with moderate wear. I know they are not expensive, but this is just too quick and wasteful."
2.0,"I love the look of this handbag.  In fact, it's beautiful. I've received many compliments on it.  However, I've only been using it for a month and both handles are coming apart.  I would think that it should take more than one month for something like this to happen.  Very disappointed."
2.0,The stone fell the second day..
2.0,"This product seems to be of good quality but loose at the ankles and very tight at at the top under the knees.  Would be perfect for someone with heavy ankles and skinny calfs.  For a compression stocking to work well, ones needs it to be snug at the ankle and non binding i.e. comfortable at the top."
2.0,"please advise -- ordered 1 set, but received only 1 set<br />love them but, would like the 2nd one I had paid for also!"
2.0,Just didn't fit right. This dress was not for me.
2.0,A little too tight. Got the biggest size but they still feel like a pair of tights... too bad I really liked the print
2.0,"Silicon/rubber arms get stuck in hair.  I returned immediately.  The concept was good, just didn't work for me."
2.0,"Overpriced, super thin, screen printed cheap looking design, and the socks have almost no stretch so they barely fit my 14 year old. I'm giving 2 stars only because of the design because they were a Christmas gift and my son thought they were funny."
2.0,Wish I had read reviews and not just the description. The flowers are not embroidered and looks cheap.  I will be returning.
2.0,"At first I noticed some pulled threads that I was willing to deal with by pulling them through the underside, but then I noticed some large holes in the knit. Bummed, cause I really like the style and color otherwise."
2.0,"I love the pattern and the fabric. It looks gorgeous on the hanger. However, I ordered according to the size chart, and it fits perfectly everywhere except in the chest. The chest part overlaps at the cleavage, but for some reason it GAPES open. The fabric is floppy there and doesn't really stay put. I wear a 32D bra, and still the chest is saggy, loose and gaping open. I think if I had bigger boobs, they would fall right out of the top, instead of filling it out properly. To keep this dress, I would have to sew the chest pieces together to give it more structure, but I didn't bother because it was still way too low-cut for my taste (showed my bra). Beautiful dress, but all-around a weird fit and I couldn't figure out how to fix it. So sad. It also arrived smelling strongly of cigarette smoke (the other dress that came in the box did not smell of smoke. Both were individually wrapped). If you're considering buying this dress, I say go for it. The fabric is a great quality, and if you have Amazon Prime this qualifies (at least right now) for free returns. So you may as well try it out and hopefully it will fit you better than me. But order knowing it may not be what you were hoping for."
2.0,"These plugs are beautiful but they're way too big. I'm a 0g and ordered the appropriate pair, but i just cant get them in. I've tried lubing them up, going in from back to front, taking a hot shower before attempting, everything. They're just too big for my ears and I'm really disappointed. Won't be ordering from this company anytime soon."
2.0,The garment was too bulky and heavy.  Also too long.  The package also had a sweater enclosed which I did not order and do not want.
2.0,Short seemed a bit small for me.  The graphic on the T seems a bit off center.  Fabric it self even after 3 washes still feels stiff and scratchy.  I would recommend a different shirt.
2.0,"I would never buy these again. the waist is too stretchy and slides down. Pants slide down in general.  Washing them on 'delicate' made them worse. I bought 2 pairs and am going to give them to charity. I bought this brand a couple of years ago and they have been great! Yelete, you need to go back to basics!"
2.0,The necklace/bracelet shipped fast but there was black marks all over the gold balls. Seemed cheaply made.
2.0,Not very long & material was itchy
2.0,The product was shipped and received faster than expected. Please note that only the edges of this ski cap are lined. I was expecting the entire cap to be lined.
2.0,Came in shaped funny. Not exactly what I thought.
2.0,"The backs fit so tightly that I could barely get them off. By the time I got them off, my piercings were extremely irritated from being messed with so much. One of them bled and is so irritated that I can barely get an earring through it. But I had no problems with them while I was wearing them. Only removing them was a problem."
2.0,"The shirt was very nice the size I purchased was a medium but this was not what I received...  The product sizing is not women's but rather Juniors, which is stated right on the shirt itself.  I don't know about you but to me there is a big difference between women's verses juniors when it comes to sizing---I would not have purchased this product had I know the sizing was a ""juniors""... Buyers beware the sizing is actually ""Juniors"" and not ""Womens"".<br /><br />Cheers"
2.0,Just didn’t fit me well
2.0,The socks are not as thin as I thought they would be and they seem to be too large so the heel rides up. I hope they will shrink in the wash so the fit will be better.
2.0,Fabric was very clingy and very thin. So as to show more then it should. Loved the design just wish they would use a better quality cotton t- shirt.
2.0,I love the design but was not happy at all with the material. Thin and see-through I was planning to wear this to work and I can’t exactly wear it with my bra lines showing. It runs small so it was very snug for a large. Crinkles easily. Had to return!
2.0,The plastic &#34;jewels&#34; fell off in the box as soon as I opened it! Very cheaply put together.
2.0,"Purchased as a gift for a family member. They didn't like it, so I tried to return it. Too much time had past. I will learn not to order early for Christmas again!  Gave it away!"
2.0,Material  is not of good quality  and it needs more length  and strength and the colours are dull
2.0,"Better description should be available, my grand can not fit it.  Yes I understand it suppose to  hug the body."
2.0,"As many have said, the bust is way too small compared to the size of the rest of the dress. Everything about the dress fit perfectly, except for the bust."
2.0,Smaller than expected got for the BF/ took them outta the package and notice they barely fit me ! I’m a womens 7- 7.5 with very tiny ankles - hard to get on - and very pink in color ….. i will wear them with smaller boots  - very thin material not stockings but thin
2.0,"I love these glasses. They look great, and are a good value. I bought them the first time directly from Readers.com, and noticed right away that the right-side ear piece was a bit wobbly. I tightened it, but it never really tightened...I made due, until it just completely fell apart. They were cheap, and looked great, so I decided to buy another pair, this time from amazon, but they were the exact same pair - they arrived quickly, and just like the first pair, looked great. But, it was the exact same issue! Wobbly right-side ear piece. I've tightened the screw, but it doesn't stay tightened, and I'm sure its only a matter of time before this pair breaks as well. I have other readers.com glasses and none of them have this issue. Its a bummer, because I like the looks of this pair the most. Its too bad. When these inevitably break as well, I won't be replacing them."
2.0,The zipper on this bra makes it look like you have a third nipple. It’s not flattering when wearing a shirt over it. It’s also not the most comfortable bra
2.0,"The charm is ok, but it's not what we expected. The picture shows detailed swirl but in actual, it's plain and details not there."
2.0,Just like the overall fit not for me
2.0,"I had high hopes for these, as I was trying to find alternatives to the socks sold at my pilates studio. These socks have your feet sliding around so much I was unable to use them for part of class because they moved too much on my foot. May be better for yoga, but for reformer pilates, they weren't great."
2.0,"Color was not as described, was significantly pinker"
2.0,The sweat shirt is more a shirt than a sweat shirt. The material is very thin. It came with lots of loose threads hanging off it. I had to reattach part of the hood after washing it in the washing machine.
2.0,Cheap quality and sits slant. It's not well made.
2.0,"It reminds you you get what you pay for. The right shoe is somewhat twisted, left one looks ok. It’s wide in the toe box, sizing is definitely on the larger size."
2.0,"I really liked this bag, it is a good size, and comfortable to wear especially when commuting on public transit.  Unfortunately it didn't even last a year before the side loop the shoulder strap clips into,  completely ripped out of the bag rendering it useless.  I don't stuff the bag either,  it usually holds my laptop,  power cord and some file folders."
2.0,Extremely large. Longer than knuckle to knuckle.
2.0,It's too wobbly to use. You have to find a way to bolt it down otherwise it'll tumble forward and fall.
2.0,Very poor quality and cheap looking returned
2.0,"I wear a Small in most brands and this one fits like a Medium. I really wanted to keep it, but it looks like I'm wearing a bag"
2.0,"The thin and rough fabric, combined with a running small, make this a shirt we can easily do without. There are much better shirts at this price point on Amazon and elsewhere. We quickly returned."
2.0,"Shirt much shorter than depicted in picture and I am only 4'11"".  Also, pearl buttons fall off easily.  The are meant to be removed for washing shirt, but they do not stay on!  Returning immediately!  At least seller has free returns."
2.0,"Good product. Stitching is good, design is good. Overall pleasing to the eye......<br />Size not so much. I'm a big guy and wear a 4x so I figured a 5x would be roomy....nope. the 5x fits like a 3x."
2.0,Too heavy! It's just too uncomfortable. Seems very well built though.
2.0,There was to many purple gems inside. Had no blues for both months September and December. Had to go buy extra gems just to finish it for my mom and mother in law for x mas. It's pretty but has to many purple gems and not enough other colors
2.0,"The quality of the hat was fine, but the emblem was too small, The proportion with the emblem is off and it doesn't look as good as it could,"
2.0,Half of my socks are shorter than the other! Really makes me mad. There's no way you can wear these if you want them to show above a boot. I definitely won't purchase these again.
2.0,"They are a comfortable fit, but they are poorly constructed I've had one pair split along the lateral thigh and after the 2nd use and another pair frayed around the waist band after the 3 wash. There is better out there for your money."
2.0,These broke really easy.
2.0,"These goggles constantly fog over. I had this issue as soon as I got them so they had not been rubbed by anything to affect the antifog coating.  They also do not fit well on my small face even after trying all 3 nose pieces that were included.  If I push off the wall to forcefully, water gets inside the lenses.  I ordered them because they were one of the few brands that have a -1 prescription but I'd be better off with no prescription and a better fitting, anti fog goggle"
2.0,Way to small I ordered a medium I'm a size 6 I had to return they would even go over my hips.
2.0,There is no compression in these tank tops
2.0,Logo to small.
2.0,"The piece is okay, but SMALL. And the four leaf clover? SMALL. I question if it is real because it is seriously tiny. And the chain is small, weak, and broke only after 1 month of wearing it."
2.0,When I recieved this the beads were off of one of the bracelets I cannt get them back on.
2.0,"I like these -- they fit and are lightweight. In fact the metal is so thin and lightweight that I'm not sure how long they'll last without becoming misshapen. For now, they are great. Cute and easy to wear. Not as dark as my Gucci Glasses (yes, I really said that) but the price works too. I have serious doubts about them lasting a long time but for now they are good to go. I have been using them for several days, but I'm careful--so far, so good.<br /><br />UPDATE: I've only had these glasses about a week but I can't fold them down because the hinges are too stiff. For right now, I can leave them open and grab them when I need them, but eventually they'll have to go."
2.0,I'm not recommended
2.0,Not impressed at all.  THe size was way off.  I could barely pull them up.  Size 7 for babies???
2.0,It looks like a toy ring that you would get from the gum ball machine
2.0,Not at all true to size. Returned it immediately
2.0,"Very soft and comfortable.<br />The only problem I have is keeping them from sliding off of my feet.  They run small and after washing and the dryer, they would fit a child size or maybe a very small size woman's foot. I gave them all away. I have size 9 feet."
2.0,"The posts are a good portion longer then other earrings I have purchase from this company in the past, earrings get caught on everything because they are sagging out of your ear instead of being firmly in place like stud earrings typically are."
2.0,The seams on this shirt were sewn very poorly so the shoulders aren’t smooth.
2.0,Fell apart the second week I had it
2.0,The material is what I expected. I ordered a size larger also based on other people's reviews. Unfortunately I will have to return the shirt.
2.0,"The jacket is decent.  Quality, not so much.  After wearing it just once the seam of the pockets started to come undone."
2.0,Nice hat but way too small. Had some with a big head stretch it out.
2.0,My wrists are not big... this is too tight. I received a small when I should have gotten a medium.
2.0,disappointed in the quality. only worn once- was washed per specifications and there is already notable wear and tear on the pants. poor quality. would not buy again.
2.0,Very cute leggings but wayyyyyy too small. Had to return
2.0,"The pockets on this dress make the shape of the dress terrible. If you keep your hands in your pockets all day, go for it. Otherwise, I’d find another dress. The shape flares out at the pockets. It is just not flattering and is eye-catching."
2.0,"This is a cute cap but has a shallow dome.  It you have a decent size cranium and hair, it does not want to stay down.  Maybe if you had a smaller head it would stay in place and be a good deal for style and value."
2.0,These leggings came too small with a loose fit rather than the skinny ankle as pictured. The material was like pajamas or Halloween costume material with almost no stretch. I was so disappointed because I really wanted these. My 11 year old daughter now has them as pajamas lol. No more Amazon clothes for me!
2.0,"I just got the hat.  The shape and the design are as shown on the seller's picture.  I don't have disfiguring wrinkles that many reviewers are talking about.  However, I do find a poorly constructed rim problem.  I found the thread on the rim was falling apart when I opened the package. The metal wire was exposed.  Either the wire was too long (1 1/2 in overlap) and the overlap was too big to hold for the stitches or the sewing job was too poor to hold onto the wire.<br /><br />The hat came from Korea and it'll be too hassle to return/refund.  I'll try to fix it for myself to make it useable.  But it is disappointing."
2.0,The quality of the material was fine for a T-shirt but the shirt was sewn very crooked so the design is totally🤔 off center.
2.0,A little too big and I wasn’t really a fan of the material.
2.0,"Size not consistent with other products by this brand. Runs one size smaller than all other shirts bought by this brand. Not the same<br />quality of fabric. Super lightweight nearly see- through. Frayed raw edges on All hems-<br />Sleeves, neck and bottom. It’s a $10 shirt not a $26 shirt."
2.0,"Too tight across the chest and upper arms, feels restrictive.  It has a polyester or some type material slip/liner, which I don't like.  I wanted 100% rayon for the heat, so sadly this is being returned."
2.0,its not so good because of the design at the back you cant really sit for a long time. they should have a zipper to open at the back.<br />I might return it. But it looks good if you are just walking and standing and wont seat hahha
2.0,"Look great,but the cross separate the second day ,have to perfectioner."
2.0,Cute but low quality. Very lightweight. The onesie has a rip at the seam of the sleeve. I already washed it and got rid of packaging so I can’t return. I washed on delicate though so no reason for that to have caused it.
2.0,This is a nice sweatshirt but it is not long. Just standard length. It is not a tunic
2.0,Cute earrings. The ones with layers had the hooks backwards so I’m out 3 pair.
2.0,The two piece I received is not the same one advertised. Different cut design in the top & bottom. Also different fabric material. It’s still a decent outfit so I give it a 2 star but not what I was expecting so I’ll be returning.
2.0,"I wanted all cotton socks . I tried them on and the cut off  the circulation in my leg .I wanted socks without elastic tops .<br />after cutting the elastic tops off , they where okay"
2.0,Cute design but the top was baggy
2.0,Was missing items
2.0,Zipper stops shirt of the edge poorly made blue run on the dress at bottom reviews misleading
2.0,I was really disappointed in this item I thought they were gemstones don't. They are plastic replicas that look like toys maybe something you'd put in your fish tank
2.0,Lenses for poor quality I can’t use them too blurry to see you in the distance bifocals worked fine
2.0,Wore these pants only 3 times and already falling apart at the seams. Use to be my favorite company but this is the second time this year that I have boughten a pair of leggings from them and they have fallen apart.
2.0,"Don’t waste your money, fabric is ridiculously thin!!! Hubby won’t wear it."
2.0,too large and not the smooth leather. leather very hard and not smooth
2.0,I needed to replace a linen shirt similar to this.  The armholes are small while the shirt is large.  It looks a little odd on.
2.0,"I didnt recieve 45 pieces! I only received 34 pieces! This is my second time purchasing this item, and im disappointed."
2.0,Arms extremely tight . Not true to size . And a bit shorter .
2.0,fits small if you have large breasts.
2.0,The arms have writing on it which I didn't know and the material is very cheap a little bit uncomfortable to wear
2.0,The dress fit fine in the waist but it was a bit short for my office. This dress is definitely for persons of shorter height like 5’7 or shorter
2.0,The shirt was a XL Ladies and it is so small it could fit a 12-year old.
2.0,I wanted to love this. It's just not what I expected. The material is super soft but I'm curvy and this just doesn't cover enough of my stomach as I'd hoped it would. It appears to be a bit longer in the pics than it was. I have a DDD chest so I always anticipate for the top not to come down as far but it's just not flattering for my body. I do like the shorts with a different top.. I normally would go for a 1x/2x but I sized up to a 3x
2.0,For right side only.
2.0,"On my body, this work so well.  I had to return it.  But, I do think it would be great on another's body type."
2.0,Could not wear the normal size. I sent it back.
2.0,"Cheaply made. The back was broken upon arrival, I chose to not make a deal of it because they were so cheap."
2.0,"Smaller then expected, very unhappy looking for something a little more expensive next time"
2.0,"My ring came bent and only after having it for 2 days, two of the big gems fell out... a little upset because I was pretty excited to get the ring in"
2.0,Nice glasses over all but the nose peice has a sharp edge on the foam peice. It can be fixed with a little know how but shouldn't have to fix anything that's new.
2.0,I did not like the material and it was too big on me. I had to return it.
2.0,The stone is pretty but the chain broke after one wear. But not bad for 3$
2.0,Looks cheaply made. Material is thick but the top is scrunched and cheap looking elastic. Doesn’t show like this in the photo.
2.0,"It was a lot closer to a neon than the light green it was described as, but it was very cute. However, why anyone would attach a brooch pin to a hair fascinator is beyond my understanding- it gets caught in your hair! The alligator clip was perfect, but I was so disappointed to see the pin (I’ve ripped hairs out with fascinators that have these attached before) that I returned it immediately."
2.0,"Shrunk extremely easily. Washed on cold and became short/fat. My husband will never wear. Plus, it was very pricy. Material is very soft and comfortable."
2.0,Too much fabric. Prob better for tall people
2.0,This is not Pashmina
2.0,Super baggy and shapeless. Sleeves are almost bell bottomed...just weird. Disappointing as I loved the image. And took FOREVER to arrive
2.0,One of the ropes was broken.
2.0,I received all 4 rings and they all look great but they don't work. The &#34;spring action&#34; is more of a &#34;stuck action&#34; because they all get stuck when you try to put them on. You get what you pay for.
2.0,less than 7 months and the strap has unraveled. I liked the purse but thought it should last longer for the price I paid.
2.0,Cheap all the way around. And the chain is a weird length it either needs to be longer or shorter
2.0,Looks cool however they arrived .. metal was pinched one more than the rest. Trying to unbend then to get on my fingers
2.0,"Pretty but much bigger than expected, will not work,i regret buying these."
2.0,Very stiff and would a always pull to the side of my wrist
2.0,"I ordered the White color. Ordered 1 size up than my regular.<br />Overall fit was fine, but it was tight under the arms, so when you lift your hands up or stretch to get something, the jacked pulls you under the arms."
2.0,Loved the colors and design but turned the skin on my finger green after a few hours of wearing it.
2.0,I ordered a size 18 and they fit more like a size 14. Very disappointed.
2.0,The dress fit good and the color was great (lilac) but I didn’t like the material. I was expecting a Jersey Knit and this reminded me of a swimsuit. Will be returning.
2.0,"I ordered twice one time , I ordered medium and the second time I ordered large but still they still can't fit me. I am only 140lbs. I wish I could get a refund."
2.0,It gets tangled alot
2.0,The beasts fell off and broke off my ankle right when I tried it on. Also very big in size.
2.0,Design is beautiful fabric is thin and the hips are shaped odd
2.0,"After seeing my first apron, and how functional all the pockets would be at work I ordered several more. I was REALLY excited about these aprons. Unfortunately after only one kitchen shift a piece all of the aprons have threads coming loose on the right pocket from having a towel go in and out of it. Also some of the aprons have space in the skinny right pocket for a small utility knife, but on others the stitching from the towel hanger gets in the way; not much of an issue considering all of the other pockets, I just wish I could see these things lasting more than a month or two without needing significant repairs."
2.0,The item is way to small.
2.0,Very soft and nice fit.  First time I wore it I put my<br />Hand in my pocket and it ripped apart
2.0,I’m usually an XL and the 2x was too small.
2.0,too large and in the rain it Absorbs water like sponge
2.0,"Uncomfortable, and restricting. Also not a good purchase for a guy who is color blind..."
2.0,"This dress runs extremely small & the material was cheap! Had to return for a refund,"
2.0,They’re very cute and bright but man they are so small wont fit my husband .
2.0,"The glasses shown are not like the glasses I received.  Theyre similar, but definitely not the same as the glasses in the photo.  I suspect these are a knock off and not real Coach.  If they were genuine Coach glasses small details like ""Coach"" not being included on the lens (as pictured) would not have been overlooked.<br /><br />In addition, one lens was slightly larger than the other.  Definitely strange."
2.0,But I can still wear it - understand now clothes coming from China is made to fit they people so we on the western has to ask for XXL
2.0,"The price was good for what I received. They were not as silky smooth as the Haynes Brand. They have a coarse rough feel to them. Not uncomfortable to wear, just not smooth. The state they are thigh high pantyhose but you can't have both. They are either thigh highs or pantyhose. These are thigh highs. They did stay up all day even under denim pants. They are off black in color with a slight grayish look."
2.0,Fits as expected and super soft but very poor quality. Only lasted through 2 washed before holes were forming near all the seams.
2.0,"Nice watch, but: curve of the lugs causes watch to not fit larger wrist. Mine about 8''."
2.0,My feet hurt every time i wear them.
2.0,"I love this watch and get a lot of compliments on it.  Unfortunately, just a bit over a month after the return window closed, the knob on the watch broke off.  I have no way of changing the time now and daylight savings time ends next week :-(  It was a fun watch, but obviously not made to last."
2.0,item arrived with the fake leather scratched.<br />I got it for my wool cloak but it isn't sturdy enough for heavy fabrics
2.0,"Was very nice and I liked the brain, however the snap broke off after 1 month and I had to throw it away.  Disappointed."
2.0,"Cleaned them first put them in, went to bed woke up it had already left that green color on my skin. Very cheaply made I'm assuming because I've never had a body jewelry item do that."
2.0,DONT BUY THE NIKEY SIGN PEELS OFF
2.0,The bottoms were ok and the top was too small my chest wouldn't fit in the top. Disappointing because I really like the suit if only u can pick your top and bottom size separately
2.0,"This Jose ring got caught on EVERYTHING! Every shirt, blanket, even my daughters hair. I was so afraid I was going to rip it out of my nose I took it out"
2.0,It was too small and not like the image
2.0,"I got this for a friend of mine for her birthday, but when she opened it the chain was tangled, and the Slytherin charm fell off. Luckily she was able to fix it, but it was disappointing to watch her open her gift and see it in such a state."
2.0,It's ok. I look fat in it. LOL
2.0,"Not a fan. Too loosey goosey for me. Doesn’t matter how much you adjust the straps, it just says everywhere."
2.0,"The other side is a flat surface without the pattern you see on the pictures. If you are like me and pretty much the rest planet, a hoop will not hang parallel to your jawline and the ugly, lazy flat side will show all the time."
2.0,"This dress is cute and the material is good however if you have a bigger butt it’s definitely too short for comfort. Unless you plan on standing in one spot, don’t bend down or walk. I’m a size US 16"
2.0,strap fell apart after a week of regular use going to have to return it
2.0,I thought I read somewhere that this was leather. When I received the shoes I was really hugely disappointed.
2.0,The bracelet doesn’t stay tight at all. So if your looking for a bracket this won’t work.
2.0,Sleeves are too short!!
2.0,The material is cotton. Look washed. The color blue is not what I expected. Will try to sell on amazon. I am done with the ladies clothing. Size is smaller. The color is wrong. The material do not look right.
2.0,"I thought to not bury the lead.<br />This shirt is not linen, it is 95% polyester, and 5% spandex.<br />I guess they didn't think ""Casual 95% polyester that you wish was linen"" worked as an advertisement.<br />I like the cut, but it feels like I am wearing a rubber shirt.<br />I may wear this over a t-shirt on a cold summer night when I am not worried about breathable material."
2.0,All wrong I'm a plus size woman and that's what I ordered  this is for a petite woman
2.0,bigger than I thought it'd be. the pointy end stabs into my bellybutton which was insanely uncomfortable. easy return
2.0,the sweatshirt runs small.  it doesnt have any stretch.
2.0,"cap has a weird shape where it puffs up top, not very fitted. inside silk lining is nice option"
2.0,I ordered this in blue and i was shipped a gray one. They didn’t even have the size I wanted in gray and that was what was sent to me. I like the outfit and would order again and try to get a blue but I’m afraid I’ll get the wrong color again.
2.0,Fit great before washing. Washed in cold and hung to dry—shrank to unwearable.
2.0,It was pretty and I gave it as a gift. But it broke the second time my sister wore it.  I was very disappointed in the craftsmanship of it.
2.0,Smaller than expected. Cheaply made.
2.0,A smallish watch that is somewhat cheaply made.  You get what you pay for.
2.0,Looks so dumb on me. Uncomfortable because there are wires in the top. Not very thick either. Ears are hard to bend
2.0,Too long and thin material
2.0,Was much brighter red than anticipated<br />I was looking for a garnet but it is still a very flattering dress
2.0,Much bigger than the description of 1 inch. They are encircled with two rows of crystals. Much too big to wear comfortably.
2.0,"I bought this for my granddaughter just before school started.  I was really happy at how fast it arrived.  She loved it!  Very adorable.  However, she didn't even have it for two weeks and the zipper broke, and her water bottle cracked.  She is not a rough on her backpack, it was just normal wear and tear.  I was hoping it would last longer than two weeks."
2.0,It’s a nice looking ring. But it turned my mans finger GREEN. I wouldn’t but from this brand again.
2.0,I LIKED THE COLORS & THE FEEL.  BUT IF YOUR LIKE ME AND WEAR A MEDIUM YOU WILL NEED AN XL.  THEY ARE ROUGHLY 2 SIZES SMALLER THAN WHAT YOU WOULD NORMALLY WEAR.  I ALSO DIDNT LIKE THE FACT THAT THE TAGS THAT SHOW THE CARE INSTRUCTIONS TAG HAD BEEN CUT OUT OF EVERY ONE.  I WILL SAY THE RETURN WAS EASY AND I RECEIVED MY REFUND VERY QUICKLY.
2.0,"I love the look but I’m disappointed that the inner compression layer is so loose. To put things in perspective, I also ordered down 1 size for a snug fit."
2.0,"I ordered my original size which is an XL. It ""fit as expected"" so i bought my size. When i received the pants and tried them on they were very very tight especially in the leg area specifically the calf part. I was so upset because they're really cute pants"
2.0,these are very short and I am concerned that they will stay inside the boot.  It is a gift and hopefully it will work for them.
2.0,Dont like the product as it takes some getting use to.Struggle to remove cards for quick payment.Idea is good just not practical.
2.0,"too cheap, and too small. Made with small asian sizes in mind. I am 5&#34;7 125lbs and a cup ... it didn't fit."
2.0,"Terrible quality. Very cheap second hand. Look elsewhere. Get a seiko, orient, citizen, or something like that."
2.0,"Fist of all, when I ordered this product, the description said nothing about it being foldable, otherwise I wouldn’t have ordered it. It seems it has since been changed. It also seems that they are selling two different versions of this product. Some reviewers are posting pictures of a well structured hat and reporting a sturdy brim, while others are saying that the brim is flimsy, as was the case with the one I received. It was folded three times in the packaging and the brim was irreparably bent. It didn’t match up with the photo, either. There were no tags attached, as shown, and details on the hat were different.  The fit and comfort were okay, but the look had been ruined by the folding, so I sent it back."
2.0,"There are several reasons She did not like this product. One, the ad says &#34;SATIN&#34;, and indeed they are NOT SATIN!!  If you look closely at the ad, it says what they are made out of. NOT SATIN!!!! Two, when she was removing them from the clear packaging, things had already fallen off of them. There was thread just hanging from them, where they were not even sewed. Pretty but poor quality of workmanship."
2.0,"I bought this a long time ago (about a year or two?) and I've already made a review on the deku hoodie, but I'll just somewhat repeat what I said in the previous review. All in all, please do not get this hoodie.<br /><br />Cons<br />- this material is horrible. It's swimsuit and the fabric rolls into small white whisps that DONT come off the jacket no matter what. They appear if the jacket is rubbed on too much which tears the fabric. If you wrap it around your waist and sit down, you're doomed.<br />- will not keep you warm. I don't know why any reviews say otherwise. This is very thin without lining or very bad lining. Take it literally when I say the outline of your hand will appear clearly when you shove your hand into the pocket.<br />- the string adjustments disappeared elsewhere after a while. They are not secure.<br />- the zipper might not zip when you pull it up. May have to try multiple times to get it right.<br />- this goes with little to nothing in my pretty extensive closet<br /><br />Pros:<br />- get new friends because people recognize the design really easily.<br />- colors are vibrant<br />- that's it<br /><br />My greatest regret is buying this hoodie for 20smth dollars. Please invest in a product with better material, you won't be disappointed with it."
2.0,Kinda cheap looking. I've bought other jewelry in this price range that looked more expensive. The chain looks especially cheap so my plan is to use the charm on another necklace. Not a total loss but I wouldn't recommend this product.
2.0,Great watch band but the pin broke off after first few hours of wearing it?? Can't take it off now :/
2.0,"Delivery was awesome, but the suit runs small. Ordered a size bigger than I normally wear just in case.... Still too small"
2.0,"No good for bumper plates, they fly right off the bar"
2.0,"I have bought these, tried them on and noticed they will not stay sitting in place on my shoudlers. They constantly move from place to place when I tried to life  my arms. since then I have never used them. These shoulder pads just sit in my sock drawer. The padding and shape are perfect, but they do not stay in place. I have tried using the velcro flap to keep the pads latched to tank top straps and tried even bra straps. It just keeps moving. I feel like I would need to glue these for it to look as intended. The product has room for improvement. The shipping was fast, customer service great...just the product is not what I had hoped"
2.0,"At first I was admiring the size and weight. When my eyes adjusted to the light, I found that the pieces were more of a bronze/ copper color, rather than traditional gold plating color. Not satisfied at all..."
2.0,Too wide for me...but am using it....next time I will ck the dimensions!
2.0,Looks old and used .Does not look like the beautiful color shown here.I won’t wear it and it is worthless
2.0,"Has no real value, kids love them but too small for young ones, choking hazard. I would. Not purchase future items from this vendor."
2.0,I gave these to my neice - flimsy material and too tight
2.0,My shirt was more of a light purple color and the fabric was very different from the picture.
2.0,They are WAY too short. I’m 5’ 10”. And they material is like sport like.
2.0,The Earrings were a little too big for my like. Look better in picture. Shipment was about 2 weeks long.
2.0,Poncho very light weight. I expected to be able to wear it in cold weather but it is very thin.
2.0,It's a nice boot and fits good but started falling apart after having them for 3 days.
2.0,I have bad eyesight and they don't help me like I thought they would.
2.0,The lenses are nice but these glasses are HUGE. They would only fit someone with an enormous head.
2.0,Missing the one color I wanted. Look too big but didn’t even try them.
2.0,"As others have noted, and though they call these the &#34;classic&#34; Mush, they are most certainly not the same as the original version. I ordered and returned these since they did not fit even though they were marked as the same size as my tried and true original Mush flips. These new &#34;classic&#34; Mush sandals run one full size small, meaning that I would take a 13 instead of a 12. They are physically identical to the Mush II but simply offer the &#34;classic&#34; colors and patterns. The footbed area is not the same as the original either but now approximates the newer Mush II style."
2.0,Really small but decent quality! I don't think they'll stay in my nose Long as it is so small I can't add anything to secure it
2.0,"I was very disappointed when receiving this necklace.  I bought it for a great-niece's First Communion.  Not that it cost lots of $$, but the quality of the necklace was not worth the price.  It looked more like something that I would just pickup - not something for a special occasion."
2.0,They are a little small plus 2 of the silver ones were either broken or missing a stone
2.0,Just too wide top to bottom
2.0,"You can’t breathe, no one can understand you when you speak but it’s pretty"
2.0,I couldn't pick a size so I thought it would be adjustable. Not the case. Its thick metal and not as cute or thin looking as the picture.
2.0,It was cute but the wand doesn't work
2.0,"I was falling out of it and I don't have much to fit in the first place. I just tried it on for my wedding dress fitting and is not going to work, I have to buy something else. And can't return, which I understand as I have already out it on. Also gives no lift which I need to fit my dress right."
2.0,Good style but arms and bust too small
2.0,"I'm 6""6 and 245-lbs. these are not for me."
2.0,I don't think I've ever written a bad review but I received a different color lighted necklace than what was shown in the picture. There wasn't a place to choose the color so I expected a blue and got a white. Although it is pretty( hence the 2 stars) people need to know what they will be receiving to avoid unwanted purchases and returns.
2.0,"I bought this wallet back in April, 2018 cos I didn’t want to pay $100+ for a ridge wallet. So here’s some thoughts for using his for the last 9 months.<br /><br />Pros: it holds the cards well and has a tight grip. I hold about 5-6 cards I’ve gotten into a habit of flipping and spinning the wallet and catching it. Money clip holds the bills tight and can fit a reasonable amount paper currency. The functionality works great and it still holds.<br /><br />Cons: the cosmetics of this wallet is where this wallet fails. At $14, you can’t really expect much. The paint started to fade really quick starting with the Phillips head screws. It looks cheap after a few months of daily use and I guess they used some blue primer paint underneath this wallet?<br /><br />It’s a decent alternative to the more expensive ridge wallet, but you get what you pay for."
2.0,Strap was glued cam right of now it’s just a string that’s hangs
2.0,They’re sort of big and idk they look sorta cheesy.
2.0,"I washed this with clothes alike this when I first bought it and it came out worse than it went in. It literally was like the lint trap and had fuzz, hair and other fibers on it. I had other black long sleeves in the same load and they came out spotless. Horrible material"
2.0,Solid material. Have to order 2 sizes larger for perfect fit and tight neckline
2.0,"Cute pattern, but the material is very thin. Even with the double layers it's still very thin. The material is like that of an umbrella. A little disappointed in the purchase. Didn't meet my expectations. Feels very cheap."
2.0,This is the fourth Review I’ve written about this shirt! It’s not as advertised it’s not the right shirt!  Since Amazon refuses to post any negative comments about  Products. I Am Done with Amazon!
2.0,"It was very disappointing to find that this was to small, not at all true to size."
2.0,"The piece that connects the chain to the owl has broken, and when I asked for a replacement, I have been given the run around."
2.0,It was Okay...Broke very Easy and Was Cheaply made.....
2.0,Beautiful sports bra. I wear 36DD and the XL was so tight I could not wear it. I had to send the two I bought back.
2.0,"The only reason im giving it 2 stars is because it has potential to be a cute dress. I ordered an extra small as my waist is small. I'm about 116 lbs, 5'3 and the waist area was still a bit loose, and the dress at the front was a little too short for my comfort. So, overall, not happy with the dress and will be looking to return."
2.0,Looks very small and thin as if it would break easily. Quick to kink up as well.
2.0,Super pretty ring. I really loved it and was so excited about it but stone fell out the very first time i wore it.
2.0,"After about 4 months of use, water leaked in and the watch stopped functioning properly. I used the watch about  10 times in a swimming pool. The watch is marked ""water resistant"" and the details on the Amazon website says it's water resistant to 30 meters (100 ft.) and then says ""Will withstand accidental splashes but not suitable for swimming."" I did not notice this qualification when I bought the watch. The bottom line is don't use this watch for swimming or other water activities where the watch is in the water for more than a few seconds."
2.0,The button/snap was broken upon arrival. had to repair
2.0,they were defective and had to return them
2.0,It finally came in. .I was very disappointed in the quality of this case. In the picture its pink but the cover that came in is white and is very cheap looking.
2.0,"The item looked nothing like the picture, the material looked totally different the length was too short.( not like the picture) where I wanted it to wear with jeans, I'm now wearing it with a dress to church"
2.0,"The frame is in the way when I try to put on my eyeliner which is why I bought them. Also, the right lens won’t stay all the way up after lowering and raising it.  I thought they were lighted, too."
2.0,Did not look as vibrant as the picture. Just ok.
2.0,Loved this but it broke after 20 minutes. Made really cheap
2.0,I needed the dress for a wedding if the blue bled into the tan in some areas
2.0,Could not use.
2.0,"Love the soft materials, but these are way too tight and make my hands hurt. The sizing is more appropriate for young children ages 8 - 12."
2.0,Not a fan of the 18” length  I rather the 20”.
2.0,I bought larger than recommended and it still was too small and way too short. The quality seems ok
2.0,Clasp broke after just 2 months of wearing for swim practices
2.0,"I'm not as happy as I expected to be with this dress. The top is quite awkward. It doesn't lay properly unless folded down, and when folded down, it doesn't stay unless you don't move at all (which I suppose could be easily fixed by tacking or fabric tape). The fabric feels cheap (doesn't necessarily look it), but I bought this for a graduation ceremony where you couldn't see it under the gown so the look of the fabric and the issues with the top of the dress weren't visible. I would not recommend this dress unless you are willing to make alterations at your own expense."
2.0,"These look lovely from a distance, but they are very cheaply made I don't think they will last very long."
2.0,"Super cute, but the fabric started pilling after only one wear.  This wasn't expensive, but it still feels like a waste of money for something I could only wear once (not to mention it's wasteful).  Such a shame because it fit great and I would've bought multiple patterns if it had held up."
2.0,"I am disappointed with this item.  It is smaller than I expected, and the color is more flat than I expected."
2.0,Wore it one time and the zipper broke by the end of the night.  Not a happy camper!
2.0,The swim shorts were missing but granddaughter wanted to wear it so she used other shorts under it. I'm not a bit happy
2.0,"I bought it for a gathering, very thin fabric. Picture is misleading, would not purchase again."
2.0,I’ll most likely never wear this dress. The fabrics both feel cheap and unforgiving.
2.0,"While the knit is pretty and light, and regular sized, slim ladies might find this flattering, plus size ladies should beware being deceived!  The 'plus' size of this sweater is not 'big & tall' 'plus sizes'.  I normally wear a 3x size and sized up to a 4x for this sweater, to be sure it would give me the roomy, floppy look pictured.  However, it was small on me, a close fit like I was wearing a normal sized sweater too small for me.  My guess is the 'plus' sizes for this are 'normal sizes' 12 to 20 (1×-5×).  So, the 'plus size' description of 'oversized', with an image of a small model wearing a way oversized sweater is very misleading.  I have started a return with 'inaccurate website description' as my reason! [Note: If my review doesn't show a purchase, my return would be the reason!]"
2.0,It didn't have the ruffles on the shoulders like the picture provided and the color was off.
2.0,"The goggles themselves are decent but the connection to the fan is beyond poor. Most people I’ve seen with these, including myself, have had to redo the wiring and/or replace the whole fan system."
2.0,"Very thin material, you can literally almost see through the socks"
2.0,"Silver ring lasted 3 days before silver started rubbing off and revealed white underneath.  Fit was good, but disappointed in wear of color."
2.0,The part that holds the pins feels very cheap and the pins don't always hold. I won't use these.
2.0,Shoes did not come with a box.  They were cute but we don't have means for storing shoes without being able to stack boxes so they had to go back.  I've never had shoes arrive like that so I didn't think it would be an issue.  We didn't bother trying them on but they looked true to size though I will say the padding inside was hard.  Not much cushioning.
2.0,"did not last long, and you could definitely see the outline of it."
2.0,My daughters favorite gift and she received a hoverboard<br /><br />Update 1-19<br />Watch has now died. Hoping manufacturer will exchange for me since it hasn’t even been a month. Daughters loved it but needs to last longer then 25 days.
2.0,They are great until they break... and they break from minimal use.
2.0,"Like the watch, but is tight on my large wrist."
2.0,I was so upset when after three weeks of owning this beautiful tote the strap broke clean off! I am upset that I missed the window to return it.
2.0,"The products is very stiff, not in a sturdy way.  The material used feels like this cardboard covered in some strange material.  If you don’t have a flat tummy already, It doesn’t hug in the areas that will flatter your figure.  I wouldn’t wear it under clothes to go out or anything.  I still feel very boxy. Overall, it’s exceptable but not great."
2.0,"Look better on the model, kind of cheap looking in person."
2.0,"Product has some major detail issues that if I would have know from the beginning I would have never purchased it. But you buy you test and you learn. The ringer button is almost impossible to move, and the cover for the headphone jack and charger port is so hard to cover."
2.0,It is very low waisted
2.0,The quality on these isn't great. The earmuffs by Degrees and far Superior.
2.0,ORDER A SIZE DOWN
2.0,Be sure to size up. Had to send back and they don't have my size. Great jacket otherwise!
2.0,Small and thinner material than I expected. Cute but not worth the price
2.0,I'm so disappointed with this sweater.  The color is what the picture shows and the material is thick which is nice and it is some what long but it's not slouchy like the picture shows.  It doesn't hang off the shoulders at all and the lacing on the back hardly goes down my back.  The sweater itself is baggy but it's for sure not what the picture portrays it to me.  I unfortunately am contacting the seller to request a refund or trying to return it.
2.0,"Crazy thick and make your face look all wonky, the nose wire is coming out in two of them after one wear, and they're making me break out like crazy. Definitely not a re-buy."
2.0,I ordered one for my gear s2 and it didn't fit. This only fits the s2 classic.
2.0,You get what you pay for!!
2.0,"Arrived quickly. Packaged well. I’m a U.S. woman size 6 tops, 36B bra. I usually wear a size small or medium top, depending on the cut/style of the top. I ordered the medium for this polka dot, mock neck top. It is cute, somewhat see-through, slight stretch, love the color and polka dots. The size is way off. This is probably a medium for a 6 year old child. Not adult sized. On me, it’s a tight, belly button exposing cropped top. Keeping it for summer to wear with shorts."
2.0,"I wear a size 16, so usually like to get sleep clothes large-I got the 3X and barely got closed-but it gaps open as it is WAY to small-will be re-gifted to someone who wears a size 10 or 12-but loved the fabric"
2.0,super super small! I wear a size 4 and the medium was WAY to small.
2.0,This wrist closure is horrible!!!! To loose and not functioning
2.0,"Ordered a small for my 14 yr old, 5’2” 120lbs, and it was really small and short. Nice material and stretchy. Reordering a medium."
2.0,"They were incredibly tarnished when I received them. And the picture makes them look like they are rather large, but they are actually quite small. Not what I expected. I’ll still wear them I guess, but they are really rusted it sucks bc I was looking forward to these. You c an make them at home."
2.0,This seems to run a bit small. The quality seems decent otherwise.
2.0,I snagged this for a deal so I won't complain too much. It's cute but not very good quality and short in the skirt area.
2.0,"They’re pretty soft and comfortable but the waistband feels a little tight at times and the legs feel a bit too large. I’m a size 10, I got the l/xl because they annoyingly don’t have more than two sizes. I’m 5’4 and they basically go up to my bra, it’s laughable. They were also quite long on me. They did nothing in the way of tummy control."
2.0,"Looks cheap, is cheap. You get what you pay for."
2.0,Haven’t had a month and it has already ripped
2.0,"Wanted to return but not worth paying the postage.  Very poor quality, stripes were even crooked because of the cut and stitching.  Would not reorder.  Guess I’m stuck!"
2.0,Difficult to install and remove links.
2.0,"I wanted to like this but it ended up looking tacky and cheap. The back did not sit flat and looked like it was supposed to zip, but it broke. Returned it."
2.0,Do not order 2 sizes up.  One size up will give you a loose fit. Original size will be a snug fit.<br />Other than that the overalls are made of good material & nice color .
2.0,"They changed the title of the product. It had read &#34;Pirate Hook Hand (8)&#34; Which I understood to mean it was a lot of 8. Turns out the 8 was for the size in inches, not the quantity. Way too expensive for just one. You can find other ones on here just as good for much much less. Unfortunatly the cost to ship it back would eat up the refund I would get. So I'm stuck with it. Lesson learned."
2.0,Runs small go up a size
2.0,I would probably like it better if it wasn't so big.
2.0,"While it looks nice.  It is made cheaply, the gold rope broke when I was trying to put it on. I only wore it once before this happened.  Will not order again."
2.0,Very small. Barely fits a child. Very think and flimsy
2.0,"I'm pretty positive they aren't  amethyst but very cute nonetheless, especially for the price."
2.0,"These tops were very thin & did not offer much compression, they shouldn't be described as compression clothing. They're ok if you just want a thin, sort of stretchy tank top. As a layering piece they do add warmth without bulk so that's what l use them for, or to sleep in they're soft & comfy."
2.0,"Pretty, but the gold totally wore off and it started turning my finger green in less than a week. :("
2.0,I did not like that the straps were small round pony tail holder like material. It would have been nice to have had wider straps. I would have been more disappointed if I had of paid full price.
2.0,The dress was too small even though I ordered a larger size. However it is a very pretty dress. I requested a return but never got a response.
2.0,My puppy destroyed this toyed same day within 30mins
2.0,See-through material that I didn't expect in a hoodie like this.
2.0,Not my favorite shirt. My retired military husband did t like it at all.
2.0,When i received the shoes they had a very strong grassy smell.  Took a long time to get rid of the smell. I can tell they are well made but my granddaughter will never wear them.
2.0,The top fits small and bottom fits well!
2.0,This item is more like a lightweight cotton tunic shirt with shredded cotton strings as lining.  It does have 2 pockets. No back slit to accommodate it's length for sitting.<br />I am disappointed in the quality and it is not true to description.  It is pretty.
2.0,I thought these were cute! But there was definitely not a 100 and there weren't a lot of animals! Mostly objects! Kinda disappointed. Maybe I got a bad batch?
2.0,"The band broke only a few days after I started wearing the watch.  The actual timepiece still works, but the broken band makes it unwearable.  It is a $12 watch, what can I say?"
2.0,not what I expected given the description.  they are pretty though.
2.0,"Sweater very short and skimpy. No info was given regarding size. I ordered it as birthday request by granddaughter, but did not think it looked like a $35.00 sweater."
2.0,"My kids have been using these in swim lessons.  They have worked great!  They do fog up but the occasional hand wash with dish soap fixes it.<br /><br />————>Update, fogging issue is worsening and dish soap isn’t working."
2.0,Runs a bit large and the fabric is awful. Returning it. Just say no to polyester. lol
2.0,Order XL  for men with beard. Too small.
2.0,Do not buy this watch. It is adjustable but as soon as you put it on the clamp moves and the watch does not fit snugly on your wrist. The band looks nice but it is a big disappointment.
2.0,These are cute but HUGE! I purchased 0-6 month and these probably won’t fit my daughter until she is 2!
2.0,Order 2 sizes up trust me ladies its no joke. Take my word. What a waste of money.
2.0,"Very thin material, not at all slimming or control type material. Too thin to wear as swim shorts!"
2.0,Wow it took over two months to arrive! A lot of money for a kids T-shirt that she’s changed her mind about wanting in 2 months!
2.0,"More brown than orange. No real color pop. More muted earth tone. It was okay, but not the intense color of burnt orange dominance I wanted."
2.0,Not bad for the price. Definitely  dark but one major flaw. Direct sunlight  these are great but if the sun is to the side of you it reflects off the lens into your eye...<br /><br />Update: had to take a star away because I'm literally looking myself in the eye. There is a shiny finish on the back of tbe lens to you see the reflection of your own eye. I would not recommend these glasses
2.0,Fits strangely at the shoulders.
2.0,The fabric is very thin. Might as well painted the dots on my skin.
2.0,"After seeing a coworker sporting this dress I really wanted to love it, but despite ordering a Large to accomodate a larger chest area, lifting/moving my arms pulled at the fabric and made it an uncomfortable dress. I am 5'6"" and the length could have been a bit longer, the loose look definitely wasn't flattering for a curvy woman."
2.0,"Cute but you cant read the script, & the chain comes off by just a liddo tug , poor quality but still very cute"
2.0,"My daughter was so excited about this for a Hermione costume. It looks great and seems to be good quality, but we received a defective product. The chain was the same on both ends, instead of having the connector piece so there was no way to fasten it. With the craziness going on I wasnt able to return it earlier and missed the window. Hoping it is a one time deal because it does seem like a good piece"
2.0,"The size I ordered is my normal size, but these are too small."
2.0,Fabric is not what is expected
2.0,Very cute but poorly made. Broke the first day of wearing it.
2.0,"Outfit Feels Cheap, There’s No Support In The Breast Area"
2.0,Not what I thought. Cheap plastic necklace..
2.0,The colors not the same
2.0,"I normally wear an XL stretch or 2XL non-stretch, and this fit like a medium or large. Total waste of money."
2.0,The nose bridge wire is starting to poke out on the exterior side. They didn’t cover/reinforce the wire ends better sewing them in. It’s better than poking into the interior side but still makes them unwearable because the kids can scratch themselves.
2.0,"Well, this is a disappointment in a couple of ways. I'm an avid collector of high end, high quality, well made leather goods and I have several pieces that have been in service for 10 and 15 years that still look beautiful and show almost no wear. (I have a Floto bag that is 17 years old and is in weekly rotation and an Yves Saint Laurent bag that's 16 years old and simply gorgeous with seriously hard use) The key is construction from only very high quality leather that is finely finished without skimping. Unfortunately, this piece does not meet those two minimum requirements from minute one.<br /><br />It arrived with scratches and scrapes on both the front and back. The interior is not finished or sealed - it's just left raw and rough. The entire piece has an odor - fine leather should smell delicious in that way that only fine leather can. This smells....off. The leather is thin and bends creating crease marks each time. My problem here is that this isn't high quality and it's advertised as such.<br /><br />This is a very tiny little, unfinished pouch that will hold a few business cards or some coins in a pinch. It's not fancy. It's not made from high end material and it's not something I would ever give as a gift or carry myself."
2.0,Way too large especially through the back. Length is nice and color is true to image but it's still getting returned.
2.0,"I usually like a looser fit and go with a L in dresses. When this product arrived it was literally falling off my body, it was so big! So after reading more reviews, I decided to return the L for a M. Once again, such a weird fit in the bust area and it gapes in the back as well near the neck. the material is more like a cotton nightdress but the style is not sexy. I ordered for an upcoming vacation to go from beach to other activities so i guess I will make it will work. Overall, pretty content with the price/quality."
2.0,"this is very small for an XL, pretty short (almost cropped) and no pockets. Probably going to return."
2.0,"I bought these slacks because they were supposed to sit mid calf and have a bow, which I felt was cute. The bow is not bad. The fit however, is awkward as it sits extremely high on my waist and the pant length sits right at my ankle, but only if I pull them up high. These are not flattering at all.<br /><br />I bought these because I needed some variety to my business casual attire, but I am very disappointed with the pants."
2.0,The armholes were too small
2.0,I bought a 4 x when my american size is a 2x. Shirt was still snug.  Seams are unraveling :(
2.0,Beautiful earrings. They were bigger than what I expected. The problem I had is that the back of the earrings were rubber and did not support the weight of the earrings. If they had a better back piece it might have worked out.
2.0,I was in need of some new pants for range days and training. When these arrived they looked really nice. I have some courses of fire from kneeling positions so I liked they had the knee pads built in. Those were easy to put in and take out so they could be washed.<br /><br />The only drawback is the sizing. I normally wear a 34 to 36 in my Blauer pants so I went with a 36 pant. That was way off and a more than a few inches shy in the waist.<br /><br />When you order these order a few sizes up and you will be fine.
2.0,Was a good watch until it broke down inside... Wtc...
2.0,"Based on the glowing reviews I ordered this ring.  What a mistake.  This ring looks nothing like the picture.  The metal is very dull, almost looking like tarnished silver.  I don't know if that's what titanium is supposed to look like but it wasn't pretty.  The CZ weren't as brilliant as everyone said they were.  This looked like a 5 dollar ring you would get at WalMart or somewhere similar.  Please don't waste your money on this ring.  I mean, I know I didn't break the bank on it but it isn't even worth 30 bucks!!!  Not even 10!"
2.0,"I paid for a jacket and it should be considered as a blouse.  The fit is fine, but very disappointed in the fabric.  It is very flimsy.  I am not satisfied with my purchase and I am less likely to purchase clothing from amazon in the future."
2.0,"This serves the purpose and nothing more.  When I first received it, I tried to change the combination on the lock (per the instructions) only to have the lever you push get stuck so couldn't change the combination or close the case.  My husband finally got it free, but it is still very hard to open.  If I was a jewelry sales person, I would not use this case to display my wares.  It looks nothing like faux leather, more like plastic-embossed covered cardboard.  The only redeeming factors are that the necklace loops actually keep your necklaces untangled and there is a lot of space in the bottom to store unusually shaped jewelry."
2.0,"Listen, this hat is SO small. Truly, so small that it’s unwearable on an average adult sized head. I have to return it or maybe give it to my cat."
2.0,So I thought I was getting a cocktail length dress but they sent me a maxi dress! It was very pretty but I wanted a short one as advertised. Had to return
2.0,Product fits as expected but I was sent yellow instead of safety green. It’s not even close to green.
2.0,"Cute shirt, love the color, but it runs way too small and it is very thin fabric. I definitely recommend sizing up. I always purchase a medium in this style of shirt, but this fits like a small would."
2.0,The dress is very pretty but the bottom is strange. One side is straight and the other side curved. It looks weird like it's not intended to be like that. I'm returning
2.0,"Would love this shirt IF it didnt have a side tag that scratches my skin, no matter what or how I try to remove it. Makes the shirt annoying and uncomfortable. All because of a sown-in plastic side tag that is impossible to remove."
2.0,"Bought the xxx size, waaay tooo small. Material is paper thin"
2.0,"Sleeves are made too small. I Would send it back if I still had the option for free UPS pick up. But since I don’t, I’ll keep it. It’ll be in the back of my closet and never get one. The dress is almost completely see-through as well. I guess it would be OK for someone who has a thin build. Not flattering for someone who is plus size."
2.0,"Purchased in July of 2020, today, 10/26 2022, both liner zippers decided they no longer needed to stay together.<br />Would not recommend this product."
2.0,"I was pleased at first - nice handle, looked good.  On the 2nd use it bent about midway.  Not happy now."
2.0,"Sent size 18, I wear a medium"
2.0,"I expected 4mm to be about right, but really it is child sized. I returned the product immediately since the size was not to my liking. I never even tried them on to keep them properly clean, so I cannot comment on how they are constructed."
2.0,Was way too small for an XL....  very disappointing!!
2.0,"Not what I pictured. Pleats didn’t really show and it was definitely not casual office wear, more like pajamas"
2.0,"I purchased this item, and it was only one.  I did not get the second one. I like the ring though, it is easy to get the keys on it.  You just push the bar to the side and put the keys on.  It is strong and works well.  I am not sure why I ordered the single on, but this shows the double.  If I am due a second one, please send it to me."
2.0,"I really loved the product, but i ordered 2 pairs<br />of earrings, and only received i pair, never received 2nd pair, very disappointed"
2.0,You get what you paid for ...
2.0,"looked like silver but came as gold, looks really cheap"
2.0,Ordered 3-4t and it is more like 24 months
2.0,Returned I didn't care for the material.
2.0,I really like this bag but the workmanship on the lining is very poor. The lining keeps getting stuck in the zipper. It happens with both top zippers.  I would think for the price the lining should fit nicely inside the purse.  Not very happy when you are purchasing something and you can't open your purse!!
2.0,"I purchased this several weeks ago to give as a gift to my husband.  When he opened it and tried it on, it was extremely small.  The arms run small & the overall girth is extremely small.  It looks more like a medium than an XL.  I can say it is very soft & would have been a great shirt had the sizing been more realistic."
2.0,"Too long. I dont know 1 human who has a belly button that this would look ""fitting"" on."
2.0,"Nice and lightweight and seems quite durable. I really like that it has the reflective stripe and cuffs fit nice and secure, doesn’t seem like water will leak down the sleeve.<br />Now for the negatives;<br />*The zipper is the wrong way, like on female clothing. This is a men’s jacket.<br />* The hood is able to be rolled up and stored in the collar, but when I got mine the collar was sewn up in the back and I had to cut the stitching in order to get the hood inside.<br />*the hood does not store properly in the collar. The ends of the opening in the collar are sewn too short (about two inches inside where the hood is sewn) and the hood does not store correctly as the hood fabric is going in the storage pouch at an angle."
2.0,"The idea is great. It does fit all my cards and money just fine. The issue I have is, the carbon fiber doesn't have any give like a soft leather wallet. When you put it in your pocket, the edges of the carbon fiber would most likely wear through your pockets over time. I wouldn't say they're &#34;sharp&#34; but it is a crisp edge all the way around. I went with a good ole basic double sided money clip instead."
2.0,"Was disappointed to see that it's completely see through.. It's like a bathing suit cover up they even sent a bathing suit underwear to go with it, pic is misleading but I love it kind of tight around perimeter of boob area"
2.0,No complaints at this time with this product
2.0,I disliked the belt & I’m allergic to silver & I didn’t liked that the buckle was poking my stomach
2.0,Too tight at neck area. The pocket is always folded in. Doesn’t do a good job to collect crumbs.
2.0,The stiching on the mask distorted the picture. The picture was not an accurate representation. I am returning it.
2.0,"Too small in the arms, and the neckline was weird."
2.0,"Bought this for riding dusty mountain trails on ATV's. Was hoping that it would work as a dust mask. However, the material is so thin that the tube is really not effective as a dust mask - maybe better than nothing, but not much better. And because it is so thin, it is also not effective for keeping your face warm under cold conditions."
2.0,I absolutely LOVED THIS DRESS! UNFORTUNATELY  I have to return it because once I put it on (again) for my main event it **%^$# BROKE! I was so upset!!! It was an hour before the party!!! TOTALLY DISAPPOINTED!!! After trying this on a few times with shoes/jewlery I thought I had the perfect dress. Had to send back! Would like to re-buy but now that the party is OVER I'm not sure when I would wear this dress..too bad
2.0,Texture of  the  fabric
2.0,Por el precio hubiese esperado algo de mejor calidad
2.0,"Unless you’re like model thin, don’t waste your time"
2.0,"Loved this bracelet, wore it a few times.<br />Took it off the other day and sadly it broke, not very durable as I'm not hard on things."
2.0,These were too thick for my earring holes. I haven't had that problem with other earrings before. It hurt to put them on.
2.0,Good quality tie clips but I’m extremely disappointed. I bought a set of 10 for gifts and my package came opened with 2 clips missing.
2.0,"They almost came up to the knee on the first wearing but after washing in warm and not completely drying them , they are now two inches shorter and will not stay up and just slide down and cut off my circulation. The company said that since I've worn and washed them that I can't get a refund and I can't return them and I need to call them about an exchange, I'm thinking for more socks just like these. So that's a no."
2.0,The shirt is super cute but very short. I could hardly get my head through the opening of the shirt.  I am 5'8 and ordered a Large. Size 38 C. Chest area was perfect. Wish it were longer.  Going to try to make it work cause I love the sleeves.  It is just not long enough for work because skin would show if I bend or have to reach for something.
2.0,These are very cheap
2.0,Too small in all the wrong places and poor quality fabric. I may have compromised if it fit as expected. Disappointed.
2.0,Sparkles 'rub off' somewhat quickly
2.0,"wasnt a fan but my teenage daughter did like it.  Definitely runs small.  Im 5'2 155 and it was too small, my daughter who is 5'3 and 17lbs fit it perfctly."
2.0,"I've bought 2 pairs of these over the last year. My first pair was absolutely fantastic and still holding strong to this day. The second pair was a big let down. When I went to put them on I heard a cracking sound from the elastic. (The sound old dried out elastic makes). Also, these didn't hold their shape much. The became super loose in the crotch area and keep falling down. I've only had these ones for about 2 months and they're already looking worse then my ones I got over a year ago. I don't know if I received a bad pair but it makes me not want to buy another..."
2.0,"The seam that is sewn between the skirt and the elastic band sticks out inside the skirt and is very scratchy. It was unfortunate, because the skirt is totally adorable."
2.0,Did not receive a string to tie up the back of the dress and have to wear it as the maid of honor tomorrow. Very disappointed!!!
2.0,"I bought large and decided to go with this brand instead of what I previously purchased.<br />I didn’t care for the wrist part of the gloves as they are loose and stretched out. That glove part gets hooked and particles can get inside.<br />If my return date is still valid, I’m returning the gloves for a refund."
2.0,other than the tritium this is flimsy and crap
2.0,"I find it hard to believe that this is actually a Nike sports bra because it is so uncomfortable and low-mid quality. The band has scratchy, plastic like elastic in it which hurts when both putting it on and wearing it. It also feels like an old, worn out swim suit too - where the elastic has degraded and it gets that ""crackling"" sound and feel to it. It's also hardly stretchy at all - it was a struggle to get it over my head because it simply wouldn't stretch.<br />I feel like this sports bra was made years ago and then sat on a shelf in direct sunlight and dry conditions for all that time.<br />Very uncomfortable for $30."
2.0,"So I bought this dress when there were no reviews for it, figured I'd be brave and try it out. Firstly, I got this in the burgundy color, and it's a lot lighter than the picture. It's a brownish/pink color, the skirt is shiny tulle that isn't exactly the same color as the top. The actual dress fit me and zipped, but the top was too long for me and ended not at my waist, which was very unflattering for me. The skirt went below my knees, so it's not very short either. If you have a longer torso, it may fit you better, but on me this was a very unflattering dress. The was it for and the tulle fell made me look bigger than I am."
2.0,"Super pretty dress, really wanted to like it; however, the slit up the front was way too high. I took one step and everything showed. Everything showed. There was know way I could wear this out."
2.0,I love this dress is comfortable and the color is nice but there are two holes in my dress fress out of the bag. I am supposed to where this to a wedding on the 9th and don't have time to return and get a new one so that is disappointing.
2.0,"This shirt seems fairly true to size.  I am not thrilled with the fabric, it is a little clingy so it does not do me any favors."
2.0,Spiders and scorpions are cool and made ok but the horns don’t come apart and ordered 2 sets and neither work
2.0,"The watch was not working. Contacted Timex, they said this item was discontinued. Had to get a new battery installed."
2.0,Was looking forward to trying this outfit.. Unfortunately it runs very small. The 2xl fits like a large...very tight and does not stretch at all.
2.0,The lettering is off centered.
2.0,"Smaller than I anticipated. But, if you're looking for something really petite, this would work."
2.0,Cute but the fit was too big
2.0,Seam on inner thighs separated after less than 5 wears...
2.0,"I ordered this shirt in my normal size expecting a regular full length t-shirt to arrive. It's pretty much a crop top. I gave it to my boyfriend's daughter who liked it, but I'm disappointed in the length. Otherwise, it's well made."
2.0,Cute but extremely small! I bought the 9/10 for my 8 year old and they fit my petite 5 year old!😳<br />I'm keeping them for her instead of returning them.<br />The material is very spandex like.
2.0,"These are super wide, and stick out a solid inch on each side of my face. Not recommended unless you have a large-ish head"
2.0,"The dress is not true to size, very thin and see through."
2.0,The shorts were baggy to the point where it looked like I was wearing a diaper…but the waist band was perfect.<br />I recommend ordering a size smaller than normal and praying the waist band isn’t too small.
2.0,"The fit was okay. The elastic around the hem was sewn properly as were the panels. However, the entire dress is ruined by the fact it's a thin neoprene/flimsy swimsuit material and basically see through. It would be gorgeous if it was actual sweatshirt material, or at least cotton. Will be returning."
2.0,I bought the largest size I could but unfortunately my glass frames are too large.  The sunglasses actually sit inside the frames of my prescription glasses!
2.0,Three of the 5 sets showed up ok. One set showed up broken and the other set was not even a close match to each other. I was pretty disappointed after opening the package.
2.0,I loved this item when I ordered it. It took a couple of weeks to come but I knew I needed it in my life. How cute this would be for my son's graduation dinner. It finally arrived. I was so so excited. Put it on and it was too small. I always wear an XL so this surprised me. I was very disappointed. Wish it was true to size but it is not. sad face
2.0,Product looks cheaply made. That explains the low cost. The sizes are not accurate.
2.0,"Main reason I ordered these was for the transparent light green look. However, they are nothing at all like in the pic(the lenses). They are completely dark, black. Which I really don’t like much. The overall quality of the glasses are actually quite high, what with the bargain price of 9 bux. Which is why I’ll keep em rather than go through the trouble of returning. Lenses are •Glass• which is rare these days, the tortoise color is nice, frames feel sturdy & durable. Too bad though, because I’d really love to get a pair w/ the light green color, I like to wear glasse in/outdoors/driving, & not have to take off whenever I’m going inside somewhere. I’m including 2pics, one of them on my wood table, & one on me, and you’ll see how dark they are. Research BEFORE purchasing."
2.0,Not same collore
2.0,"Very disappointed in the product. It would probably fit a woman or child but didn't come close to being big enough to fit my wrist. If you are a normal sized male don't bother, it won't fit you."
2.0,There were no rhinestones on the glasses.
2.0,"The round metal clips for the attachment are too bulky under my boot.  They press on my ankle unless I can get the strap situated correctly.  The clips also bulge slightly through my boot at the ankle.  I still use them only if necessary, and when I can adjust them throughout the day.  The straps work, but if I order again, I would order a style with a clip that is more flat."
2.0,"I bought these because they were a good price point, but I now regret not getting the pricier alternative. They somewhat do their job, but the other with the press clip back is much easier to place and hold a lot better. Also, it's still not short enough for the skinny ties my husband has."
2.0,Pretty but The chain broke the first time worn
2.0,"You get what you pay for, they look great but they really irritated my fully healed septum and I never have had any issues with it until these"
2.0,No waist. Fits like a box.
2.0,"Boxy, awkward, and had a weird, stiff feel to the touch. Not as cozy and fun as I had hoped."
2.0,Did not like these shorts at all they fit weird at the bottom not flattering at all
2.0,It was cardboard covered in furry material. Cheap cheap
2.0,I USE THIS SHIRT FOR BED. The picture and the item I purchased do not look anything like this. The shirt I received was super thin and cheap.
2.0,This looks like a 2nd or blem product of BD. I have had these gloves before (purchased from BD) and they were much higher quality.
2.0,"Cute and looks as expected.  However, washing instructions say “professional dry clean only”.  This is a child’s pajamas.  Will try delicate cold wash and hope for the best.  Made in China."
2.0,I am very disappointed with the size. The description said one size. But this is not one size. This is size small for a child. Otherwise the quality is ok.
2.0,I loved these when i first got them. I had them for about a week and then one of them started to turn and tarnish. Im so bummed out. I had planned on buying more but decided that $25 for something i only got to wear a week was not worth it. its too bad because these are really cute.
2.0,"I thought this T-shirt would be a lot more vintage style feel and look. However it was very cheap looking, the holes were Really weird they were super symmetrical and burned into the T-shirt I think instead of natural looking tears to make it look worn. I never ended up wearing it. The plus size is that it was a really nice thick quality T-shirt material and the size was very true to size. Some people may really like this shirt, it super soft and comfortable.  I personally just didn’t like the “forced ”  vintage look of it."
2.0,"Really dark lenses, but not very clear optically. What you get for polycarbonate lenses and not the real glass"
2.0,"This is a cute dress and I really wanted it for Halloween but that did not happen, it was way too small for me.  I usually wear a XL and this runs like a M or L.  I suggest to size up."
2.0,"coming out of the package it looked amazing, then I looked at it in the light and saw the spray paint job was pretty sloppy. Several places has thin paint cover. The my son started playing with it and the paint started to peel away. I'm not sure if it wasn't cured properly or the paint doesn't adhere to the plastic glove but either way, it's a peeling mess.<br />Damn shame too cuzz the little guy was crazy excited at the start."
2.0,"Love this purse. This is the 2nd one I’ve purchased like this. However, the leather feels a bit stiffer than the first one I purchased. And the metal clasp that closes the front pocket came off and I can no longer secure the pocket closed.  The purse is still in “like-new” condition and I’ve only used it a couple of weeks, so this isn’t overused, just defective product.<br /><br />However, based on the first one I had, I love the concept of this purse. Frees up my hands and mobility and my items are more secure to my body.  This purse holds my<br />Phone, debit/credit cards, keys, cash and change, everything I need on a daily basis."
2.0,The rubber should be softer at kind of Beats you up on side of the head and the first pair of broker ready on one side I think I can repair it with some super glue though have it ready if the other one breaks LOL period on the good side it is very nice looking with the glasses very classy
2.0,I wear a 29 and ordered a 30 since it is the smaller size. The 30 was even huge on my partner and he wears a 32. It’s a shame because I love the style but there is no way these can even possibly be “fitted” unless you are really really thicc!!!
2.0,It seemed fine. It was light weight like I wanted but the zipper broke first time I used it.
2.0,"The strap is much too small for an adult - the overall length is not adjustable. I can barely get the opening over my head and then the uke sits up much too high. The opening in the clip is not wide enough; if I clipped it to the uke I'm afraid it would ruin my instrument's finish. The capo is nice, though."
2.0,The zipper is not navy. Too bright blue for my taste thus returned it. Other than that its a good value and well made.
2.0,I did like the pants but I very disappointed they don’t fit. You don’t have the right size.
2.0,"Very small. Workmanship is nice, but tiny."
2.0,"Cheap material. Buttons all have popped off. Arms are way skinnier than the rest of the shirt, the shoulders are very very narrow. You have to have a little body for this to fit properly IMO. I’m 5’7 and 145lbs and a size large fit like a small."
2.0,"Unfortunately, this dress was way too small even though I ordered my usual dress size. Got busy and can't return it due to deadline return. Maybe, I'll miraculously become small enough to fit into it one day!"
2.0,"I actually had to purchase this item 2 times. The first time, I received the wrong dress entirely and the second time, when I tried it on, the dress hit mid leg and looked absolutely ridiculous. It did not look like the picture (length wise). The only reason I gave it 2 stars was because it had the potential to be cute, and it seems like if you get lucky and get the right dress/good quality one, it will probably look good. I think this company is probably selling a ton of inventory without checking the products for quality first."
2.0,"The cap is fits and looks OK.  I do have one major complaint, the black dye and the lettering dyes are NOT permanent.  If the cap gets wet, either from rain/snow or perspiration, the colors will run!"
2.0,"The earrings are beautiful, but they are two different earrings. One has a larger stone at the top and the other a small stone."
2.0,It's soft and it's cute but the sleeves are too short and I hate that! It's also fitted in the chest but kind of baggy in the waist and not in a good way.
2.0,"The style is really nice but it’s just not made properly.  It was recommended that I purchase a medium. I purchased a large, which was still too small around the waistline and the sleeves were loose. I’m 5’5”, 240 pounds, 34 DDD."
2.0,After having the glasses for over a month I would not recommend them.  The plastic is coming off and gas station glasses would be better.  I wouldn't pay more than $5 for these glasses.
2.0,Runs  to small
2.0,"Cheap, generic cap. Small print. When tightening to get the hat to fit, the lettering bunches up making it difficult to read...which was the whole reason for buying! Disappointed as it was intended as a gift."
2.0,"Looks nice, poor quality stretchy string, broke immediately when I first put on"
2.0,"Dress is gorgeous! Fabric of the dress I received is rayon but dress does not correspond to the size chart shown - in fact it doesn’t even come close! Sadly returning the dress. I bought the largest available and I’d say it’s about a size 10 at most, maybe a size 8. DO NOT GO BY THE SIZE CHART!!!!!"
2.0,There was a whole after 1st wash.
2.0,soooo BIG even for an X-L.
2.0,I don't know where to begin with this purchase. All I can say is GROSS.<br /><br />1. It didn't flatter my body shape at all. The photo makes it look shapely and as though it would hug the body in all the right places but this just hung like a sack on me. There was no shape at all and it just looked sloppy.<br /><br />2. The color was way off which bothered me. I ordered Wine and I really expected it to look rich red like the photo but when I opened it I was shocked to see how faded and ugly the color was.<br /><br />3. Very cheaply made and the material is so thin you can see through it.<br /><br />This article just wasn't for me sadly and so I returned it.<br /><br />It may have just been the color or my body shape because I really like the way it looks on other people's reviews.<br /><br />I included pictures of how faded it was but they won't upload.
2.0,"I was actually excited about this shirt, but first off, it does not look anything like the picture.  The color and the material are different in the picture than what you get. So, in a sense, I am disappointed in what I got. The design of the shirt is nice, but it is more of an undershirt. The good thing is that I was actually able to receive this item for a discounted price in exchange for an honest and unbiased product review because otherwise, I would not have bought it at all. I normally wear medium size shirts, but I figured I would get a large size. I am glad that I did, because it is also a really tight fit.  So, over all, my experience with this shirt was not great and I cannot really recommend it. I will however give it two stars, because I do like the design and I think that this company has potential."
2.0,"I ordered a large and it was extremely small, could fit a small person."
2.0,"When I received these shades in the mail, they were completely bent out of shape. I bent them back into a reasonable shape and was able to wear them with a costume I planned to wear, but my overall impression is that they are overpriced costume glasses. They are either junk, or the person who packaged them put zero care into it and allowed them to get squashed in the mail."
2.0,Sure came apart early wore two times
2.0,"Thick and shape of them show through fabric, t shirts or a heavier fabric.  Didn't work as I expected."
2.0,I normally wear a large and I ordered a large and it was small... I would suggest going up a size. Also material is odd.. doesn't look at good as the pics... looks cheap
2.0,"The fabric sucks! and the color is not WHITE, it's IVORY!"
2.0,[[VIDEOID:392d75428af198cc26ea50bdc3f9eb06]] Outfit is cute But I’m 165 5’1 b cup pants a size 9<br />I thought it would be a bit snug (shape fitting) I ordered a SMALL it’s loose the top fits great but the pants are not for me (I’m not slim I’m in the middle hope this helps Yes is came with mask
2.0,I bought these shoes because I needed a cheap pair of flats. I read the reviews and everyone said they ran small. I normally wear a 7 so I ordered a 7.5. They fit in length but they are VERY narrow. My feet are killing me. I've never though I had a wide foot but these are just very narrow. I read on pinterest that you can put a Ziploc bag of water in them and put them in the freezer and it will expand the shoes. This didn't work. I'm wearing them because I need them but I'm really needing to break them in. The sides and back of my feet are killing me. I'm not sure if another half size up would make a difference or not. I will say that I like that they have a padding at the front of the shoe that helps give a little more cushion. You just can't really wear these. Thankfully I sit at a desk so as soon as I sit down I take them off and only have to slip them on to walk around the office.
2.0,"Strap is super thin and cheap, plates look okay, rhinestones are junk. Plates are slightly crooked."
2.0,"So I was looking for something kind of like yeezys,  but affordable. These were cheap, and cute, but you could feel the cheapness. They didnt last a month. I probably wouldn't buy again. It felt like a waste of money! So unfortunately I cannot leave a good review."
2.0,Xl is more like a M . I returned mine because I was disappointed in the sizing it fit me but it was way too tight thank you.
2.0,"I like the shirt, feel the color is accurate from my screen however, the seams are not very neat. There is some fraying and loose strings hanging about at the bottom and sides. It doesn't look like it will survive the wash. I am 5'5&#34; and 125lbs for reference; I ordered a small. Fit is perfect. Still I am unhappy with the quality as there are other shirts I have ordered here for work that were the a similar price, but better quality. Will take pictures when I can. Edit: photos added."
2.0,I bought a XL and it was XL wide not height. My boyfriend is very tall.
2.0,It is not for plus size women.. One size does not fit all
2.0,"I wanted to love this dress so much. From the cute polka dots to the sweet bow it was everything I love in a dress, BUT it's just not made for taller girls. I'm only 5'9"" a size 8-10, but with the baby bump, it became scandalously short. A total no-go. It was the sort of dress you'd need to wear leggings with just to wear out in public, which totally defeats the purpose of wearing a cute dress. Even my husband told me it was a hard no. Total disappointment. Probably good if you're under 5'5"".<br /><br />Note this review doesn't apply to all styles of this dress. Just the Grey Polkadot 45."
2.0,the chain turned black.
2.0,"only 2 stars due to fact that pic shows bikini type pants and its not!! Its a dopey looking skirt that doesnt detach mad me mad & returned it<br />model in photo shouldnt be holding up skirt, very misleading"
2.0,It doesnt look like the picture. Material is cheap and falling apart. Hoodie strings are longer than the sweatshirt itself.
2.0,"The slippers are absolutely adorable and my son loved them. However it has only been about 3 weeks, with my son having wore them constantly for 1 week and they already have holes. Both slippers have a hole in the exact same spot. Didn't even last a month."
2.0,Material is already showing wear spots even though I’ve only worn it 4 times.
2.0,It was smaller than I expected plus picture shows it oval and I got a circle but it's still nice
2.0,It's warm but it's too slippery and makes it hard to hold on to anything.
2.0,Beautiful.. but they broke the 3rd time using!
2.0,Poorly made; might last a couple of uses. For a child’s head. Great lights.
2.0,Arrived quickly but the post was not attached to the earring. When I looked at the other one the post fell out of it too. Really too bad as they were cute.
2.0,VERY cheap fabric. not made well at all. Runs big
2.0,Had high hopes for this but the green was kind of drab. Sent it back. Might work better in another color.
2.0,"If this only cost $25 or less, I wouldn't have a bad thing to say as you get what you pay for.  However, for what I paid for this jewelry box I expected a lot better. The second I opened this, the front of one of the drawers fell off. I didn't worry about that too much, I can hot glue it on no biggie.  However, then I got to looking at it more. The lining of the drawers is very cheap. It's obvious this thing isn't going to last long. The key for the lock doesn't even work. The hooks for the necklaces are crooked.  The knobs are all loose.  I'm debating on sending it back. Definitely will not become a family heirloom."
2.0,"The top is sooo small. It is literally like nipple pasties. I have a size D chest and ordered a 5x. The bottoms fit well, but the top is 2 solid no. Feeling like a sausage in a tight casing."
2.0,The lenses are a little smaller both in thickness and size. They barely fit in the frame of the glasses. Also maybe do to thickness of lense but the sun still hurts the eyes
2.0,Skirt came in looking like it’s been wear and it was inside out. It wasn’t folded in the bag. I’m not going to wear it.
2.0,"Item is great quality with structure and colors, however, the picture it shows does not reflect product and use. The item does not go low to the chest as shown it gets stuck at the collarbone and crunches up. The elastic with the tiding and loosening band is still too tight to wear it pushes into the face underneath the eye socket which hurts."
2.0,Hate to say it but I am NOT very satisfied with this product. I should have known that it was going to be a Chinese sweatshop brand because the fabric and size is not even close to what it looks like in the picture. I was assuming a heavy fabric that is weatherproof but instead I got a very light almost sheer fabric. I didn't really look at the details and I guess I should have read more into the measurements seeing this is supposed to be for extra small/small and I'm a medium/large  so putting this on line was very hard and trying to get it off I practically suffocated myself. So for future reference unless you're a size 0 do not buy this
2.0,I love it 😍 so beautiful but I do not want to use it because is almost broke  I am sad for this 😞
2.0,Bag doesn't even stand on it's own. Pay the extra and buy the original Bogg bag. Very unhappy and should of returned but this bag.
2.0,What kind of battery does it use????<br />Umbrella hard to use but ok<br />In a pinch
2.0,Esta bonita pero queda rara
2.0,I work for Tesla but wanted a flat brim hat not offered by the company. The hat is cool but the graphics are half faded & not well applied. Better applied graphics could make the hat a good buy...too late for me I guess. I will not recommend to my co-workers...after multiple request.
2.0,A little to lose and a couple of inches too long.
2.0,Sorry about this purchase. It's too big and bulky to move smoothly on the neck. None of the bails on any of my pendants will fit over the clasp.  I'd planned it for a teen aged nephew but now reconsidered. It will be returned asap.
2.0,The fit is good and it looks good from afar but it's a really cheap material. Light and flimsy. I guess you get what you pay for.
2.0,"I'm a relatively small girl &#34;petite&#34; I prefer small sized underwear (5/6) to get a frame of reference, the skirt however does not fit me in the slightest, the Velcro barely reaches, which looks odd. The top is fine, but Im not a fan of the style, I mostly got it for the skirt. I'll make it work but, its not great. Affordable though :)"
2.0,The straps wouldnt keep velcoed so annoying stopping to fix it every second
2.0,Fits small so I gave it to my 7 year old.
2.0,"I ordered the set of blue, purple and orange socks because my granddaughter’s Easter dress is light purple and when I received them the purple socks were actually pink and nowhere near the color shown in the picture. Can she wear them yes because she has dresses that work with the colors I received but can she wear them with her Easter dress no they will not match."
2.0,Nice design but left a lot of lint on my body and undergarment.
2.0,"IT IS OKAY VERY ROOMY, BUT SEAMS UNSEALING A LITTLE AT A TIME"
2.0,"I really wanted to like this dress. Bought in 3 colors. I'm an 8 so I got the medium. The top portion was too tight in the bust and there was no fullness to dress at all.  Wasn't swing style as I wanted. And the dress was a bit short, hit me middle thigh if that. Too bad because the color ranges were amazing."
2.0,Itchy tag and the neckline hem in the front tore away with in a month. Very disappointed because other than that I loved the shirt.
2.0,"I ordered this dress and didn't expect the best quality but I was hoping that the sizing would atleast fit. When the dress arrived, it was sealed so I was completely taken aback when I opened it only to discover that it was already littered with cat/dog fur and some blonde hair. I received a used dress and the sizing was completely off. I ordered the smallest size possible but I guess this dress is supposed to be a ""one size fits all"" -- it fit extremely baggy and long. Luckily, I was able to get it cleaned and altered before my event."
2.0,They are pretty upon first glance but if you take a closer look they are more a product you could get out of a quarter toy machine.
2.0,It is not as I expected.
2.0,"Kinda looks like the photo, but as soon as you take it out of the package the fur starts to fall off and the strings that are holding the ears and legs are coming undone."
2.0,"February 15, 2016 update:  This pin broke at the clasp about 6 months ago.  I think that I wore it about 10 times.  In looking at it more closely, the metal is not very sturdy.  I am disappointed and would not pay the current price of about $10 for it.  I paid a lot less for it, like about one-fifth of the current asking price.<br /><br />Initial review:  First, this pin will make a statement.  The size was surprising; it's 1 and 3/4 inches long and 1 inch high.  It's well made and I wore it proudly to church last week and received many compliments."
2.0,"Waffle. Cotton. Long wide Velcro strip. Elastic stretch. Washes & dries quickly. Folds up nicely for my bag. Not as wide as I expected for a L/XL - meaning it could use another 4-6 inches of fabric so the the Velcro doesn’t rub under my arm. Leaves a 4-6” gap, so it’s not anything I can wear around the house. I bring it to my dry spa appnts where I’m alone so no one sees the gap. I may have to find another use for it."
2.0,"The price for six bras is the only thing going for it. I wasn't expecting pads in the bra, so it was a bonus at first.. But then the pads started shifting around. I have to re-adjust them so frequently. The pads are also very small, so if you're a busty lady, these are not for you. Overall disappointed."
2.0,It broke down. All the charms fell off.
2.0,Great service and all however the glasses don't look like what the picture shows. The lenses are more brown than mirror like blue.
2.0,Was disappointed in it
2.0,The bottoms were way too small and the top was way too big.
2.0,The back stretched out a bit
2.0,"Nice hat, but only had it a day and a pom pom fell off and I had to sew it back on. Otherwise, nice warm hat."
2.0,This wallet has a unique brown colour and it’s so solid.I love all the little puckets it has for cards.
2.0,"Well, it looked good. But...2xl is a tight fit. And dio not put these in the clothes dryer! Big and bad mistake. I can't even wear it now. Sized for little weasel guys."
2.0,"Very pretty stones, but should have spent a little more, sterling is very very light weight and the clasp is mininmal, nice design but don't waste your money."
2.0,Cheap material feels like something them old Italians would wear those jumpsuits made out of back in the day
2.0,"I got the black cat one, it came bent, which isn't the sellers fault as much as the shipping company, so Im not holding that against them. It's far too small for my ear, and I have fairly small ears. The tail doesn't reach to the top of my ear, which wouldn't be so bad if there were some sort of clip to keep it from falling down. It's really cute, it just doesn't fit at all and I'm not sure what adult it would fit."
2.0,This item is very small for the price. Kind of disappointing.
2.0,this item is good only for a TINY woman. Don't kid yourself. It will not fit anyone large or bigger.
2.0,They are very long as I am average height for a girl. The part I am upset about is they were supposed to be shaped like a “V” in the front. That’s the whole reason I ordered them. I had a tummy tuck and wanted something to show off my belly button. They are straight across. No v at all. Very disappointed.
2.0,"Stiff scratchy knitted acrylic, and the collar sticks up around the neck oddly. It's about what I expected from the price, but I had hoped for better."
2.0,"Large is on the smaller size ( i'm typically a M-L) and the frontline is too low, so wearing a bra isn't realistic, also getting it off may be a challenge, not easy with the way it's designed. It's cute though. Sending it back because if I upsize it, it will be too big in some areas, especially the front."
2.0,This item was way too big (im 5ft2 ordered a small) and was definitely not flattering.
2.0,Really not what I expected but they're kinda cute
2.0,"Bottom is very then, not what I expected."
2.0,We washed prior to wearing like we do with all new baby clothes. The turkey came off partially.
2.0,"I have a rather thin neck and this was still cutting into my skin. This seems like it was made for a child or a small Asian person, because it’s difficult to wear for anyone else."
2.0,Item was to small.
2.0,Size still too small
2.0,The size for these pants are xs-small
2.0,The hat sent was tiny.
2.0,"I was sadly disappointed with this dress. It is beautiful to look at and the stitching is well done, but there are some flaws that left me returning it quickly. First off, the color is so much more blue than grey especially in the lace top. The area around the bust/shoulders was too lose for me although the rest fit perfect. The zipper down the back was what left me absolutely having to return it rather than trying to make adjustments. It stops unzipping just below the beginning of the buttocks, but the zipper itself continues inside another 4-5 inches. Even with spandex shorts and a dress slip, the excess internal zipper continue to fall between my cheeks and was NOT a good look nor appropriate to be worn to a wedding. From the front, it was beautiful. From the back, it was a hot mess!"
2.0,"Scratchy, and not as soft or thin  as I thought they were going to be. Good color though. I’ll wear in colder weather. They do stay on."
2.0,"This shirt has ZERO stretch to it. The sleeves are too tight on me for my comfort, but I can still wear it. I can't push up the sleeves like I would like to because then the chest area poofs up and looks like I'm wearing a huge vest. I ordered an XXL and the bodice part is pretty large, I should've ordered an XL maybe, but the sleeves are so tight I don't think it would've fit. I wear a DDD bra and it does fit that area. The material is cheap, feels like a tablecloth. The shirt looks okay on, wouldn't order again."
2.0,I bought an extra large bc it said they ran small and it was still a bit too small for how I expected it to fit it fit like a fitted mini skirt which isn’t what it looks like in the picture  and the top button was missing
2.0,Smaller than I thought it would be.  Instead of one big pocket in side there are two
2.0,I can't fit my hand in an extra large and I can in any other extra large glove without an issue.  These cut off your circulation.  Use of electronic devices with these is spotty at best.  They do not protect your hands from the cold very much.  They are very thin.
2.0,The tongue rings are too short the lip rings are really short
2.0,"It's HUGE! Like belt buckle big. Ok quality, but..eh.."
2.0,The size in the description is false. They’re only half an inch from front to back and about a quarter inch diameter. Which means you can’t even see what the picture on them is supposed to be unless someone is about 2 inches from your ear.  I might’ve kept them anyways but they came to me with one already broken as soon as I opened the box. Definitely returned
2.0,It wasn't light cotton. It was more like nylon fiber. The size and size chart was completely inaccurate.
2.0,Very low quality but within quality of price
2.0,the robes run very very small
2.0,I purchased these to help guard my index finger tip from heat when using my wood burner.  The fit is fine but it did little to protect my finger from heat.  I saw no difference between wearing them and wearing nothing.  I'd save your money if you are looking for heat protection.
2.0,"very flimsy, keeps falling off my face when running"
2.0,Too long. I bought this second one as I like the black and white dress—different fit. Way too long.
2.0,"I purchased these to stay warm when I ran outside in the cold weather. First time out of the package they did great, but one wash and the waste area lost its elasticity. Now they fall down. Fine for lounging, but not good for exercising."
2.0,Purchased these for favors at an upcoming wedding. They seem a little thin and the design is printed on. Not a great quality.
2.0,Will reopen again
2.0,Too small for normal sz 18
2.0,I really love this necklace
2.0,Cheap looking/feeling. The lace is large and the tan slip underneath just looks weird. It just doesn’t look nice enough for anything I was looking to wear it to.
2.0,"Watch, box and certificate was very nice looking.  However the crown came off immediately when trying to set the time.  This may just be a defect on the watch I received."
2.0,"Runs small, odd shape, scratchy cheap material."
2.0,"i had issues getting the bracelet to come open and then i had issues with keeping it on. i think it’s a very beautiful bracelet if you’re more concerned about fashion but when it comes to functionality, it lacks in that department."
2.0,Really need to take the word compression out of the product description. These are very lightweight tights that don't appear to follow the sizing chart. I utilized the sizing chart and purchased a mens large they are quite large on me. Would not buy again but may utilize them as a thermal barrier under my pants when its 10 degrees.
2.0,"Bought this for my son’s Darth Vader costume for Halloween. They looked fine for the costume, but the inside of both gloves smells terrible, like fish. It smells like someone spilled a can of tuna inside these gloves. I turned them inside out and washed them several times with Dawn and hot water. Still smells like fish! We have to throw them away and now figure out how to find black gloves last minute for Halloween."
2.0,Pants look exactly like the picture but SO SMALL!! I couldn’t get them past my calves and I ordered up
2.0,"Band is Extremely Small , be carefull"
2.0,Ended up returning this. The sizing chart was not right and I couldn't even get them over my hips. Disappointing because it looked like a really cute swimsuit.
2.0,"Very good looking shoes but they were WAY too narrow, had to return. Very disappointing. They were also quite stiff but maybe that is because of the waterproofing-? Wish they were regular width or they would at least make a “wide” version."
2.0,Paper thin material not pleased
2.0,"It seems to keep good time, and the color was OK, but a little too much mashed English pea green for my taste.<br /><br />It arrived set on the wrong day of the week. I've spent more than an hour trying to figure out how to change the time, date, and day of the week. The instructions don't seem all that complicated, they just don't work for me. I'm going to return it.<br /><br />I don't expect too much from a watch, but it should keep an accurate date and time, and I should be able to reset it when necessary. The only thing that I could reset on this watch is the time."
2.0,"No better than a sock with tread on the bottom, therefore overpriced. No traction on river rocks at all."
2.0,They were very cute but unfortunately were too small on me and I couldn't get them on.
2.0,The earrings were really pretty.  However shipping took literally forever to get to me in January when I did finally get them the backs of them were bent to heck I was afraid they were completely broken but they still at least look halfway decent when I wear them.  They are not the most comfortable earrings to wear.  At least they weren't that expensive.
2.0,"Somewhat small in front, pulls away from leg in front because not enough room for package, poor elastic on legs"
2.0,"Very disappointing. These earrings are very cheap looking, and the wires are so thin that one was totally bent out of shape. I generally love earrings sold by Chuvora, but these are an exception."
2.0,The slippers are adorable but the bottoms were falling off after being worn maybe 2 times.
2.0,I really love the style of the dress however the white was so dingy. I bought the black one and it is fine but this one just looks like it's dirty.
2.0,"Glasses arrived today and one pair has a defect (bubble) in the glass. Neither pair’s eye pads line up correctly with the other one making the glasses look like defects.<br />I purchased for in house use (not public) so won’t be returning, but will not buy again as poorly made."
2.0,Received mine today and I was disappointed that the bow is grey not blue like the picture shows.  Looked on many different devices to see if the color would change and it didnt.  Glad I ordered a size up or it wouldn't fit.
2.0,Collar is unraveling. Shape is weird. Not long. Wide.
2.0,"Very stiff material over the toes. Maybe it will get softer with wear, but I'm not very hopeful. I had cuts and blisters over my toes both times I wore these."
2.0,"It's a beautiful necklace, but when it arrived the chain was broken."
2.0,"Nice material but not compression level at all. On top of that, it rolls up easily. Niki biki tank tops give more compression than this brand."
2.0,"mine broke right away,it is cute but very fragile..handle with care"
2.0,"After paying twice as much I was expecting at least a 50% improvement over cheaper models. My expectations were not met, this unit is no different than the $12 to $15 models. Save your money"
2.0,"The picture shows and description above says it’s a  bracelet, w/c obviously is.. but in the bottom about this item description says this ring... ??"
2.0,They seem really nice at first and my lip or labre has been pierced for over 8 years and I never ever in my life got the piercing ball actually stuck extremely tight  to the barbell . I usually clean my lip every other day so it’s sterile and doesn’t get infected and the ball n barbell actually got so tight n stuck I had to keep pulling the ball not twisting but pulled it literally off leaving my lip very bloody irritated and now thanks to this absolutely horrible piercing my lip is red swelling n I have an infection and took it out and now it’s close up after 8 years and I love my lip ring I’m really really upset don’t buy this product ever or you will have problems like myself I’m really devastated and I have an infection
2.0,I'm 5'7&#34; and the suit isn't long enough for my torso.
2.0,The shirt quality is not all that great
2.0,"Not really for heavy sports or heavy sweating as a matter of fact. These are made exactly like the ones I purchased previously that I am trying to replace. They do NOT keep sweat out of my face and eyes because they are saturated in the first 10 minutes of use. GREAT product to keep your hair out of your face for cleansing or fashion. Otherwise, don't spend your money!"
2.0,I ordered the xxl.And expected to be able to close it and tie it.I have never had a xxl fit like this.Won't return it as I will wear it and just te the belt in back and wear it unbelted.
2.0,"I liked the color, design and fabric, but it was so small.  I could get it on, but I couldn't pull it down over my chest.  Very disappointed."
2.0,"Wife review: On my necklace you can clearly see the kitty face and eyes, and in the earrings photo you can clearly see black fur beneath the eyes. On the earrings I recieved, you cannot see the fur beneath the eyes and the silver part of the earring covers part of their lower eyelids. As you face the earrings the left eye of the cats are almost all visible (without the fur showing underneath) the right is hard to see because it is mostly the black pupil showing.  The ears on mine are clearly visible giving the look of a black crescent on a yellow background.  I really wouldn't buy another pair."
2.0,DOESN'T LOOK GOOD ON ME.
2.0,"Arrived without a tool to take out the extra links, it was WAY too large.  Because it was a gift for my daughter, who was only home for a short time, I did not have time to return it for a replacement.  So in addition to paying for the watch I had to pay to get it to fit her.  Would not buy again."
2.0,The necklace was discolored in some areas but it looked ok otherwise.
2.0,Horrible. Had an awful smell and the packaging arrived damaged
2.0,I personally dont like it. There is black threading in the middle.
2.0,Hate material!! Made in China
2.0,not how it looked in picture  has a seam down the entire front of the shirt
2.0,"The padding placement is marketed to those with a bit less to hold down. If you're heavy in the cleavage it makes a kinda broccoli shaped mound of uniboob/quadraboob. But,  you can run a lot harder with one giant teet. Just, don't wear this where people can see you."
2.0,Quality poor.  Top did not fit well.. way too much side boob(wore once on beach.. will not wear again!) Would not purchase again.
2.0,But then I received the sweater. It was thin and not something I'd wear as a shirt.
2.0,Like the coverage.
2.0,My child broke the one side completely off just a few months after getting them. The unbendable part completely bent and broke.
2.0,It too forever to come and the was too small
2.0,WAY SMALL
2.0,"[[VIDEOID:d1945271f8ec89b503f7b332d3a1ba4]] I thought these were really cute when they first arrived- and they are! Unfortunately upon the first time wearing them I found out how awkward it is trying to use my index finger on the phone. The touchscreen fabric is way off center so I have to try to tilt my finger pretty drastically to even get the fabric to connect. The thumbs are easier to work with but still clunky. Then the second time wearing them a ""button"" fell off. Those are not buttons, btw. They are shiny pellets glued to the glove. So, time to return them I guess. Too bad- I REALLY like the way they look."
2.0,I didn't get the correct size but because of the quality of the thin fabic I return and didn't repurchase.
2.0,"This ""sweatshirt"" is more like a tshirt.  It's super thin and not worth the money"
2.0,Imperfections I expected perfect quality since I bought this twice but was disappointed.
2.0,"too cheap to send back.  The piercing is so long, I need two closers to keep it from digging into my head.  The design is ok, but it's really tacky looking.  I might re-create it into an art project."
2.0,This was too small. Like it but can't wear it. Just got back home from a trip and tried it on. Will sent it back.
2.0,These leggings are made out of cheap scratchy fabric. The mesh insets are squeezing the skin making it to appear as there are rolls on the legs. The waist line is too short - so if you bend over or do squats - your booty will be showing. These leggings need to be ordered size or two up - or work with long booty covering shirts. For me these were extremely uncomfortable and unflattering. Pass.
2.0,I thought the color was darker in the picture so not happy it doesn't match my purse the way I thought.
2.0,Cute fascinator. Worked for the bridal shower I was going to but it came broken and I had to hot glue it. Also the poofy part is not very secure and slides all over the headband.
2.0,"My boyfriend bought me this sweater/shirt dress for Christmas recently and for starters it’s made poorly and it is also very short if it were to be a dress. The pockets are not real pockets, and only make the “dress” poofy. I do Not recommend this to anyone."
2.0,"Demasiado chico , no m gusto"
2.0,Super cute and smaller than expected but....... The strap ripped so it's not being used anymore.....:( but it's super cute
2.0,I ordered a size up in these thinking it would fit and they most definitely did not fit. I ordered an extra large thinking it would give me a little wiggle room and they fit like a medium if that. They are definitely not true to size
2.0,doesn't matter what size it roles up or it rolls down
2.0,Gave to daughter she so could practice sewing on her sewing machine
2.0,"The style does not fit well.  Gaps on waist, too long and color not becoming."
2.0,Dress came on time and as expected however buyer beware the pin that holds the bow on came apart and was stuck in my granddaughters back.  I would suggest removing pin and replacing with Velcro or just sew on to avoid injury. Pin did not just come undone completely came apart
2.0,The double layer was just too thick for me to feel comfortable and too snug in the boobs made the collar sit weird.
2.0,Black coating on metal wore off after 1 day use and turned my finger green the only reason i gave the metal is super cheap everything else is fine
2.0,"En la página aparece un color y una textura increíble , pero el material no es de compresión, y el color es un tono más ocuro, y la talla no es"
2.0,Can’t close this wrap to secure the watch
2.0,The color I got has a metallic thread that makes the fabric very strategy on my sensitive skin. Fit was good though.
2.0,The skirt is real short and not below the knees
2.0,The colour was beautiful I’m 49”in the bust it’s fits very close to the bust and to tight in the body. I wish it came in a larger size .
2.0,when i go under water the lens for the goggles are blurry.
2.0,Not very Sturdy. Looks like it may fall off in transit
2.0,It is a cute suit. However it's a little too loose in the cleavage area. Basically because it doesn't have GOOD BREAST SUPPORT.
2.0,"Cute, but it doesn't stay on your wrist correctly.  It turns around and you cant see the paws. Just bad construction."
2.0,Not true to size. Honestly felt like they were a child’s size. Seller was very responsive.
2.0,The chain broke within a week of wearing
2.0,Was not satisfied
2.0,"This hat is ugly and too oversized in the front.  It also isn't meant for someone with a bigger head.  I donated it instead of returning it though I wish now I would have returned it for a refund.  Unless you're a petite old lady who gardens, I would avoid this hat at all costs.  It is well-made, though, and offers sun protection, so I gave it an additional star if that's what matters to you most."
2.0,"The style is cute and the fit is fairly good, but the fabric is very prone to static so it doesn't drape properly. It's also very see-through, so you'd need to wear something under it for a professional look which sort of negates the benefits of a lightweight fabric.<br /><br />I kept it because it's usable, but if I could go back and do it over I wouldn't buy it again with what I know now."
2.0,"Look cheap, fabric is not breathable especially in summer, the print is nice but that’s all"
2.0,Way too big!! Love the print though<br />Wont return because it will cost too much to send back!<br />Will order a small size!!!!
2.0,No bust support :(
2.0,"They are advertized as thick and fleece but they are normal athletic leggings. Their thickness extends only as far as not being see-through. Also, the waist is pretty wide."
2.0,Good price but poor quality - many frayed after first wash
2.0,Way too small. The size chartbb ve is very misleading. Thank God my daughter like dot cos she’s gonna wear it as a tunic.
2.0,"Uncomfortable, ancient user interface, small with limited functions. Does everything a watch should but my advice is to explore any other option. Best as a first watch for a young kid wanting his or her first time piece. I don’t doubt it’s durablity, unfortunately it’s going to stick around for awhile."
2.0,Printing quality isn't there. The picture of the item doesn't translate to the printing on the shirt. The shirt is just gray where it should be shaded as you travel through the tunnel.<br />The spirals don't match up across the buttons.<br /><br />The material is comfortable and breathable as described.
2.0,"Not useful for Athletic women. My wife is 5’0 100lbs, but is fit and the Faberic was loose on her being an XS."
2.0,"I was looking for a flat, comfy sandal and these seemed to fit the bill. Unfortunately, when they arrived, I found they were a little too small for a comfortable fit. They also didn't seem to hold on well, feeling a little closer to a flip-flop feel despite there being a strap around the heel. The complaint was very good about my returning the product, so no issues with the company, just wasn't the shoe for me."
2.0,Smaller then advertised
2.0,It’s constantly unbuckling it self. It’s always getting lose so I have to redo it all the time and I can’t be readjusting all the time I’m an armed security guard.
2.0,I ordered a large but what I got was too small and it didn't fit.
2.0,Definitely want to wear a belt with this or else it slides up or down. The material is thinnish but ok. It's a great outfit for the beach or if you're house cleaning and want to be comfortable.
2.0,Nice purse but smaller than expected. They did authorize return but of course it cost me $13.00 as I felt need to insure due to price. Will not order another purse on line.
2.0,Runs waaaay small
2.0,cheap plastic
2.0,"Heads up y’all. The dress I received was a size bigger than expected even though I ordered smaller than usual. In the pictures it looked like the same color throughout, but the top and the bottom were so different it was unwearable. Also, the fabric folded in the front on such a way that it looked like certain things were poking through when they were not. A shame because a lot of other people seemed to like their dresses."
2.0,The bag definitely looks better in pictures than in real life. When it came it a smelled funny and the small pouch that came with it had damage. It looked like water damage. The bag itself will be useable once it airs out.
2.0,"It fit true to size, but it was very sheer. You could see underwear right through the material. I returned it and the company was nice and gave a full refund."
2.0,"They'll do the job for Halloween, but you should definitely read &#34;one size fits all&#34; as &#34;one size fits small people.&#34;"
2.0,"If you are looking for a jewelry piece that is nice looking then this watch will give you that ,however on the other hand, if you want a piece that you can look at without straining to see what time it is then this is NOT the watch. The seconds bar is red and easy to read. The hour and minute hands are very difficult to read since they are a slim shaped and silver against a black background. The day display is very unique, easy to read with the white background. The overall size of the watch is nice and the band is comfortable.  While the design is attractive the functionality of the watch failed for me. If it takes me effort  to move my wrist around so the light hits the watch just the right way so I can see what time it is, then it fails my test!"
2.0,"Thinking I got a bad one...the shirt was in the bag inside out like someone had tried it on and returned it.  Which wouldn't surprise me as the seam on the top back neck area down to the v were sewn rough instead of a normal seam that is wrapped around.  Not sure if that is supposed to be like that, but it was just so bizarre.  Also, the size large was too big.  Otherwise, the pink was pretty and the material was nice enough.  Returning item in better state than it arrived as it is no longer inside out."
2.0,"Pictures are deceiving. This sweater is super boxy, which I could have lived with but the sleeves were nowhere near my wrist. This is a 3/4 sleeve sweater. Have to return."
2.0,"Very cheap writing it’s almost like it’s and iron on and feels like the lettering will come off if you scratch it And the logo won’t last very long, very cheap quality..."
2.0,This is very cute but it’s impossible to read the engraved names. 😢
2.0,"I saw this and thought this would be the most comfortable and cute coat available. In person, that would be a no for me. I got something like this for my daughter and it was pretty awesome but was sold out so I ordered this instead. They definitely looked the same but I was so wrong. It fits in some places but of course not the arms and shoulders/bust. Why do these makers think all women have sticks for arms and no boobs is beyond me. They put a weird slick lining in it that feels like aluminum foil and it makes a lot of noise when I walk. That’s just strange. And because of that awful lining, it makes it difficult to fit through the back. It pulls at me. This was a total let down. The pink fluff was great if only the other parts were bigger and that lining wasn’t in there."
2.0,"These are made of of the same material as those cheap printed denim look leggings.  The only reason I'm giving it 2 stars is because the pockets are real, not printed on.  The white pocket part is cheap rayon.  I was looking for real denim cutoffs with cotton lined pockets, not this legging material."
2.0,The colors were bright and the patterns pleasing but the workmanship was very poor. The fabric labels showed in different places.  The gown was very long.  It would have been helpful to know how long it was.
2.0,cheap flimsy thin material
2.0,Fit fine<br />Was cute<br />Wayyyyy too cheap fabric<br />Sent it back
2.0,Very thin... like paper or surgery masks. Made in china.
2.0,"Made in China, feels cheap and thin. May prove me wrong but seems too flimsy to last long."
2.0,"It is 2 sizes to small, even though I ordered 2 sizes bigger than my normal size.  It is flimsy material as well."
2.0,"These earring are VERY tiny. It's my own fault for ordering too small, but the 2 star review is because the backs are super short. Even if I did want tiny earrings, i wouldnt be able to wear these. they are designed for a child."
2.0,"Nowhere near high quality material. It's spandex, lycra fabric. It also has lines. I give it two stars because the size runs as described below and came in a good ziploc package."
2.0,El color bello pero benia despegada la perla azul
2.0,"Fabric felt nice, but one leg was clearly several inches shorter than the other. Was very noticeable when I put the pants on so I wasn't going to wear them anywhere. I threw them out"
2.0,"I ordered the pink, white and orange ones (girly ones) and only got 3 green pairs. Not so girly. Not worth the hassle to return but won’t be using these. Quality it okay tho."
2.0,"Ok, so this bracelet is actually attractive! The negatives outweighed the looks though for me.  First, mine has a noticeable chip on one of the beads.  When I say noticeable…it looks bright white where the large chip is, in a prominent place.  Second, there is no listing of what type of metal is used in the medallion or metal rings.  From the rash and itching of my wrist, I’d say they didn’t use hypoallergenic metal! So if you have allergies to nickel, brass, etc. like I do, stay away from this bracelet or put clear nail polish over the metal parts."
2.0,The material isn't of good quality. Too thin.
2.0,"I ordered two of these backpacks for my son and I. We were in training to go to Philmont Scout Ranch near Cimarron, NM, in 2018. The zipper on the bottom pouch of the first one failed within a week of packing it and using it. I complained to the company, and they sent me another one.<br /><br />Finally on our trek in Philmont July 8-20, the supposedly 80+ Liter capacity pack's other zippers failed, including the ""easy access"" zippers that kept contents inside. I had to strap the two sides of the zippers closed. On both sides. And only one of the bottom zippers (two, one on each side of the bottom ""sleeping bag pouch""), worked. That zipper, too, failed on the trek.<br /><br />But nothing was as bad or irritating as the tearing of my son's backpack's hip belt and strap from the material that it is attached to. On the last day of the trek, carrying probably 60+ pounds, my son's hip belt had to be jerry-rigged to allow him to complete our trek. The need to jerry-rig the hip belt was caused by the poor manufacture of the material, and bad stitching. And necessitated because all of us on the trek were on our way to base camp, with no choice but to continue.<br /><br />The first thing we had to do was take some of the weight out of his pack, because the pack -- not he -- was unable to handle it, despite it being able to hold it capacity-wise. He put some of the things from his pack in a 20L day pack, and carried it on his front, down more than 1000 feet of decline.<br /><br />In other words, the problem with these packs is they appear capable and sturdy for such a trek, but they fail. You do indeed apparently get what you pay for.<br /><br />Don't pay for something that appears to be of adequate quality that turns out not to be."
2.0,I like the style and fit but the lenses aren’t clear. They arrived with some scratches on the lenses. Overall the quality is cheap
2.0,The jumpsuit is too small
2.0,Didn’t include a fish.
2.0,"I received this top and while it appears to be good quality, it wound up fitting like a maternity top.  When wearing it, the front is longer than the back, as if to allow for an expanding baby belly.  Not pleased with the design, and regret this purchase.  I'll gift it to a friend that is expecting a baby rather than keep it."
2.0,These socks leave black lint everywhere. just cheaply made socks
2.0,Not the material I was expecting. Straps weren’t adjustable and it was a bit big on me so I returned it. Didn’t think it was very flattering
2.0,"Like other reviewers said, the earrings have a smooth surface rather than a textured look as indicated in the image provided by the seller. Definitely disappointed and feels like I wasted my money. Looks cheap and inauthentic."
2.0,It's to big for my pocket
2.0,I bought these for my mom and she loves it except for the snaps being to far apart and cheaply made. They don’t stay snapped so she has to use safety pins. I’ll just eventually replace the snaps
2.0,I ordered a large at first and it was too small. So I reordered an XL and it fit the same as the first one so I put one against the other and they were the same size!
2.0,"To start, the top is larger than I expected to be. Then again, 0-6 months is huge range. There's no way in hell this could fit a newborn. Too big for my 3 month old. On top of that, the material of the pants and headway are very cheap. I don't even think I can put them in the dryer, they look like they'd tear easily. Not what I was expecting. That's what I get for ordering baby clothes on Amazon."
2.0,"This sweatshirt looked great online but in person, it was thin and polyester cheap feel, it was small in fit and overall felt like I had gone to Rainbow and bought a five dollar shirt. I returned it right away."
2.0,I expected more from this product. But I do like it and wear it almost everyday.
2.0,"I should've taken heed to the negative reviews about the size and mismatch of these earrings. It doesn't bother me so much that they are big. It bothers me that they aren't exactly the same size, nor the same design. It's like they made a whole bunch, tossed 'em all in a box, and pulled out two random ones to fill my order-- never once attempting to pick two that looked as close to being alike as possible. Unfortunately, I'm too OCD for it to not bother me so I'm really disappointed. Luckily they were less than $2, so I'll probably give mine to Goodwill."
2.0,"Ordered a Medium and this was no where near a medium, it was way too small. The seams were loose in spots and not straight in spots. The material is decent, that's the reason I'm giving two stars and not one."
2.0,"Cute, but the glittery parts break off easily. Pretty sure i swallowed the pink part in my sleep."
2.0,Love the watch just not the band. Sticks to my skin.
2.0,Too small ..
2.0,Great looking jacket but huge for listed size! Unable to wear it because it’s soo large. To much of a pain to return! Be careful when you order your size!
2.0,"Cheap material, breaks pretty easily."
2.0,Not what was expected. Very cheaply made. Not what was described or in photos.
2.0,I should have looked more closely for the size. The stone is quite small compared to other items in the same price range and materials.
2.0,"The frames are a lot bigger than pictured. Additionally, there seems to be a contrast in colours between the frame and lens however everything looks alike."
2.0,Pants fit awkwardly...too long in hip/waist.  Shirt smaller fit in general...like a snug fit
2.0,"For the price, I expected better quality fabric and sewing. I will be returning this."
2.0,"I was expecting warm, roomy socks that wouldn’t leave marks on my mom’s ankles. These were not particularly long, they were thin and the cuff at the top was neither big nor stretchy.  I’ll return them and look for something else."
2.0,Half the stays I ordered have clips that don’t hold well and will slip off multiple times each day.
2.0,I feel that it is not sterling silver.
2.0,After reading these reviews it just came to my mind that these people had to be paid to say that the circulation socks were this great because my legs aren't that big and I'm telling you it felt like it was cutting off circulation other than helping circulation.  I gave them to Goodwill.  Maybe a twelve-year-old would like them just because they're cute??????
2.0,"They are heavy, not light weight as expected. Strange fit. Didn't like them"
2.0,Larger and longer than expected
2.0,I cant recommend this item Poor quality and actually kind of ugly. I love dragons and this wasn't for me.
2.0,I’m not really happy about the quality of the scarf and the color is too bright 😫😫
2.0,"Too big! Good quality, but I had to return it. It was perfect diameter, but unfortunately too much extra material."
2.0,"The medium fit okay, alittle short for my taste, but it looked cheap.  Returned it."
2.0,Really cute and soft but is EXTREMELY small! Like size XS-S - definitely not for girls with big boobs!
2.0,Very poor quality! Returning!
2.0,"3 months after purchasing the watch and only using it sparingly, the small handle stopped moving and is stuck between 5 and 6 o'clock positions. When trying to wind the watch, only the long handle rotates. I am very disappointed as I really liked the design, but it's now pretty much worthless! I hope someone from K&S reads this and does something to make it right..."
2.0,"The skirt ,  fabric was very shiny, the pleats were well done, but the back of the skirt was wrinkled, like it had been worn or sat in.  Also, the elastic is looped inside the waist fabric, which causes it to twist and turn; which is ok if you are going to wear a belt to cover it. It was true to size and long enough, but it definitely not expensive looking."
2.0,I liked it bet in the picture.  The necklace is too bulky and big and some crystals were missing.  May I please return it.
2.0,The bale is too big and the cylinder is too short for the actual pin therefore when used as a necklace the pendant doesn’t hang straight.
2.0,The top wasn’t as long as the picture indicated
2.0,It would have fit better if the straps were adjustable.
2.0,There is no support at all. If you've got anything up top pass on this one. The scalloping was also not very noticeable. It looked like a mistake.
2.0,You really get what you pay for here. Expect to have to wind the watch 30 times every now and then. It looks expensive but isn’t very well made. Not accurate
2.0,"I like the idea of this shoe but I ordered based on the size chart, actually measuring the foot, and the shoe is too small. The toes are sticking out over the sole, pushing on the fabric. When I came back to exchange for a larger size, it was out of stock so I ordered a similar one elsewhere on Amazon in a larger size which has room for growth."
2.0,"I have to be more careful about ordering items that are coming from China.  Thankfully you don't pay a lot for them because they are such low quality items.  I can use them, but they are not what I expected."
2.0,"They were to small. Only wore them once. Wish the sizing chart had been different. I wear an 81/2wide But took the biggest size and still to small. But other then that, I like how the looked."
2.0,"Not made well. Seams are crooked and the neckline does not lay nicely.  It was a low price, I should have been wary."
2.0,Not for Ray Ban Aviators Goofy Large not useful or practical at all Waste of money
2.0,"The headband is very cute and I love how it looks on, but unfortunately it doesn't stay on for a workout.  I have tried for both a spin class and also a cross-training workout, and it slipped off both times just a few minutes in."
2.0,"Beautifully made bracelet, purchased as a gift. Would have given this 5 stars if it hadn't taken so long to arrive. It was delayed forever and had to contact the vendor."
2.0,"Fun concept, but drawing fades very fast, in a few minutes."
2.0,It came with a tear in the collar. The picture made it seem there was more length to it then there is. Cheaply made and pretty disappointed.
2.0,"I understand that this is not real silver,however this braclet looks very cheap."
2.0,"These Leggings looked ok, but holy uncomfortable! they have a strange waffle texture, not soft, the stretch was eh....and only stretched to fit, they didn't bounce back.  There was no compression and after about an hour they started to slide, slip, and roll. I hated these so much that I never even opened the second pair I ordered....Returned in the blink of an eye!  They were cheap, but for my money...I'd rather pay more (about double) for Ododo's shorts and leggings."
2.0,Way to big.  Need a huge head to fit these.
2.0,After one or two washes the seams start to loosen and holes develop. You get what you pay for- cheap.
2.0,"product is great quality just not American sizes,  extremely small cut"
2.0,for small stomachs. i got big muscle arms to show but want to hide big fat belly in process.  this shirt is for slim people.
2.0,Too small for my 7.5  hat size head
2.0,I didn't care for the elasticized back so I returned it.
2.0,Looked decent out of the package. A little cheap looking. Wore it for less than one day and the link broke and it fell off. Luckily I found it. Fixed it. Another link broke the next time I wore it. Sad I wasted my $.
2.0,It was very cheap but then you get what you pay for
2.0,These are post earrings - not traditional ear climbers which are wires... Very disappointed in the product.
2.0,I like the style of the pants; but be warned they are completely see through
2.0,"I loved how this necklace looked, but the clasp broke my first day wearing it."
2.0,They look like golden antenna and nothing like Loki’s crown. They are very heavy and uncomfortable. I’m so disappointed and wish I could retuen
2.0,I honestly don't like my clothes I PAY FOR to come full of holes. Thanks.
2.0,"Fits good, but material is 60% cotton and 40% polyester. Description states: &#34;Material: 100% premium cotton.&#34; Is it really so difficult to translate from Chinese?"
2.0,They r extremely fat
2.0,Graphic is too small for the shirt itself. Material is cheap and stretchy. Looks odd on larger busts. Sleeves are oddly tight and not like pictured.
2.0,Rolls down as soon as you put then on but the material is nice and comfortable to wear
2.0,Looked ok but way too small on the bracelet.
2.0,The stitching/pattern at the crotch looks way too labial..inseam is quite long on a petite person; waistline goes halfway up my torso. So don’t buy unless you’re at least 5.5” and you plan on wearing long tops that will cover the weird crotch design
2.0,These goggles are going back!  The material is very cheap and flimsy.  I do not think they would last at all and they look like they'd leak due to the seal not being secure enough.
2.0,"Not as advertised.  Description states ""large"" readers. Found the size to be more for a petite person. Colors were nice. Quality wasn't there. I didn't feel as though they were sturdy. Maybe that is why the sell them in a multi pack?<br /><br />Poor packaging. They arrived in a bubble wrap envelope.<br /><br />Not a product I would recommend."
2.0,Fit great on first wear - but each time you wear it it gets bigger.  Now they just fall down 4-5 uses later - they still leak dye onto everything  even after all these washes - too expensive to start- now I’m having to buy more - and replace all my stuff that’s been ruined in the wash
2.0,"Not stunning. Not sure what the simulation pearls are made of, but they do not look like pearls, not shiny, not perfectly spherical either. Do not expect much for the price. You get what you pay for."
2.0,very poor quality. washed and started to fall apart. no washing instructions so I washed on delicate.i will never order from amazon clothes again. cheap stuff.
2.0,"It fit just fine, but thought the neckline was unflattering, and the dress was way too short. I’m only 5’4”, but am returning it mostly because of the length."
2.0,I like the material of the shirt. It is see through :-\ and it being from China the sizing is totally off. But cute shirt for my friend :)
2.0,"Ordered for my wife, she thought it was very pretty but smaller than actually size displayed."
2.0,It looked super cute on my 14 year old who is about 5' 10&#34;. She was able to wear it for half of the summer before the lace started shredding and the threads started coming out of the tie strings. I followed all wash instructions and was super dissapointed.
2.0,Too small and the zippers seemed too fragile.
2.0,"The fabric was awful. Stiff. Almost plasticine. I wanted to love it for the length, but ick."
2.0,"The lining is smaller than the exterior. Inner zip pockets are small too. Interior side pocket holds change. Center pocket fits a wallet. Open on either side of center, both sides are shallower than the overall bag. One side more so than the other."
2.0,The diameter of the pins are much smaller than Garmin's and therefore the band can and does come off sending your expensive Garmin Watch to the ground if you use your watch during vigorous workouts like CrossFit. Luckily when mine came apart the watch fell on a soft surface. The band itself is excellent and very comfortable and does away with the need for metal buckles and does not cover up the heart rate sensors. Also the quick release springs inside the pins are weak and don't stay in securely either. Overall they got the band right and the pins too small.  Might be good for a cheap Timex but not an expensive Garmin Instinct or Forerunner 935/945 used in vigorous exercise. Have to return it.
2.0,Tangled way too easily
2.0,After 3 months of used they were totally garbage. It is a shame because they were comfortable and look nice but as days past they just deteriorated more and more until finally we were unable to fix them.
2.0,Item not exactly as pictured. Very cheaply made and it is white on the inside which makes the fold over in the front look cheap and strange. Haven't even worn it because I can't get it to look right.
2.0,Much lighter than pictured. Almost a light purplish grey
2.0,"The set was very pretty, but the elastic on my lava bracelet broke when I was removing it. I had it for only a couple of weeks. Would have given 5 stars if it had held up"
2.0,"Perhaps I didn't know what I was ordering, but these &#34;board shorts&#34; do not have an inner lining, like a bathing suit. I don't know what surfers do when they get wet, seems like something is missing here."
2.0,"This shirt is pretty good quality and adorable, but unfortunately my women's size small is GIGANTIC! There is no way that this is a women's shirt because the torso of the shirt is so wide.  I'm 5'6 and 140 lbs and I'm literally swimming in the shirt to the point that it looks ridiculous on me. I was so excited for this shirt but am VERY disappointed."
2.0,"Scratchy cheap material, too big"
2.0,"I ordered two sizes up and it was still too small for my chest. It smashes my chest down pushing everything to the sides and is uncomfortable. Not even a little stretchy. If you have any chest size larger than a B cup, no matter how large you go they don’t change the chest measurements only the waist and length."
2.0,Short in arm length and pants pockets on backside.
2.0,these glasses are nice but they do not have specifications
2.0,Too stiff and didn’t fit much. I had to return it.
2.0,Okay the quality of this particular item is good just one flaw that came with it. The pockets are on the back side and the back pocket is on the front. So if u are planning on buying this just be careful.
2.0,At least two sizes to big. It's a dress!
2.0,I wanted it for church. But it couldn't work
2.0,it comes in small sizes and poor quality
2.0,"Weird fit, funky back on these. not your normal overalls."
2.0,It looks great just what i wanted... However it is very small and it hurts my ears.most masks are bigger.
2.0,The wallet is nice but the smell is awful. I am not able to use it.
2.0,"These pants are weird! I am 5'7 and these pants need to sit under my breast just to be the length I needed! They are far to long!<br />I bought pants from the same seller and they don't fit anything like that.<br />Based on reviews I bought a x-large. I am 5'7, 157lbs, 31 waist 40 hips 33 inseam 36 B and I have very thick thighs and calves but even these were huge on me!! They also have this weird faded white lines on the front.. those lines look fine with jeans but not with black pants"
2.0,The pendant tarnished after 2 weeks. NOT THE CHAIN. I broke out in a rash where the silver on the pendant had turned brassy.
2.0,Ran really really small. I had to give it to my sister who is two sizes smaller than me!
2.0,"Cheap material, weird fit, the arms flare out at the ends.  Haven't washed it yet but it feels like it will shrink substantially just due to the cheapness of the fabric and the knit."
2.0,They came  missing a buckle on one side.<br />Big disappointment.
2.0,"Boots arrived looking like they had been run over by a train. Hopefully the ugg shampoo and cleaning kit can recover the material. My daughter was so excited about these boots, I hope they can be saved. She has not seen them yet. If they do not clean up, she may not see them."
2.0,"The color is lovely.  The cut is nice, but the soft, thin leather goes down to the sole. I cannot wear them, even with my orthotics, because of pronation. But, if you’re young and have perfect feet, they would be great. If you’re seeking a supportive shoe though, look elsewhere."
2.0,The bands stretched out after like 3 wears and I had to stop wearing them because I was tripping over my feet.
2.0,I would not buy again. The watch itself slipped around on the band and the buckles are too far apart.
2.0,Fit okay but way too long and I’m not short. Might work with leggings and boots but not what I was looking for. Almost like a short dress. Going back today
2.0,So the size was as expected but not the fit. The fabric is very clingy and even for a petit thinner person this dress is unflattering. I’m disappointed in this purchase!
2.0,Fit as expected BUT the sleeves are unusually long.
2.0,"Cute, comfortable but the flowers on the top fall off almost immediately. Ended up tossing after I got glued the first one - and then the second one fell off I gave up. Not worth it."
2.0,They are big but was expecting that. I'm not one to complain but omg they have this terrible chemical odor. I cant get it off. I've washed them with dawn and other shampoos it wont go away I'm going to leave them outside for a bit and see if that works. They also had like black smudges on the back when I opened them but they came out when I washed them. They added a hair tie with a yellow bow on it it was a nice addition but because of the strong odor on it as well I think it will have to be trashed. By all means the shoes are gorgeous but just that smell filled up my house quick and gave me a horrible headache.
2.0,This product was way too small. Ordered an 18 and it fit more like a 14.
2.0,It arrived hard as a rock!
2.0,"I ordred this dress in black and received the white one instead. Back it goes. I hate the pattern in white. Otherwise nice dress, good material, lightweight, but not see through. Runs small, doesn't stretch much. I try ordering it again, in black, and write a message to the seller. According to the previous reviews everyone received white instead of black. I'm very upset, because I needed this dress for occasion next week, and now I have to buy something else instead."
2.0,The material on the outside is so frail and bad quality!
2.0,"I thought by the reviews this would be great but it was not. Very see through, not good quality or material. Not worth the money spent. Will be returning."
2.0,"The anklet wasn't exactly the same as in the photo and didn't wrap around the ankle twice. It broke very easily and was hard to fix. I eventually got tired of trying to fix it and thrown it away. But on the bright side, it was pretty."
2.0,I loved it till I had it for 2 days and da chain came off ..
2.0,Stones were dull
2.0,"White shirts are very, very thin. Almost see-thru."
2.0,They broke real quick
2.0,"If you are looking to get the nude colored ones to cover tattoos, look elsewhere. They are a very pale color and do not cover tattoos at all. I was planning on returning them, but it cost five dollars! The hassle isn't almost worth it. Was considering getting the black ones but I'm unsure if it will be worth it now. They do fit well, nice material. I just wish they weren't so light colored."
2.0,Ordered medium fit like extra small.<br />Believe me I’m not busty at all!
2.0,"Absolutely LOVED these pants; nice long length and had my staple colors of blue and black in stock.  Bought my first pair about 6 months ago.  Wore them all the time for working out; but also the perfect pants to wear when sitting at the desk all day from my home office.  One day my husband said, &#34;Hey, you have holes in the back of your pants.&#34;  Sure enough, it looked like it may have been caught on something because it had multiple holes along the back seam; several of the holes turned into &#34;runs&#34; (like you'd see in your pantyhose).  So I got back online and quickly ordered two new pair.  It's been about a month now where I've worn them at least one or two times a week and today noticed the very same problem.  So clearly, the holes are not something happening on my end.  Instead, I suspect that that fabric is just very poor quality.  If you're the manufacturer reading this, please upgrade the fabric selection.  Love the cut, but the poor fabric quality has destroyed my confidence in spending money with you again."
2.0,The color sent was not the dark grey/ light grey as shown in picture but instead all black. The zipper is about 6 inches to long. We'll see how it holds up for lunch.
2.0,"Sure, what do I expect for this price, right? It looks nice and keeps accurate time; however the various function buttons are way too easy to accidentally press. In the process of even taking the watch off or putting it on, you’ll find that you have accidentally reset the time, date, etc. it seems like every time I look at the watch, I’ve inadvertently pressed one of the buttons and reset the day, or time, or alarm. It’s more trouble than it’s worth, I’m afraid."
2.0,"loose fitting which i expected but looks.. meh. needs a belt to give it a nicer look otherwise it looks like a sack. maybe for pregnant women it can look nice with the baby bump but it didn't look great on my daughter who is thin, size 6 athletic build.  need to return. and the largest size xxl runs very small probably fit a size 14 . the fabric is okay and it's made fairly well with no loose threads and other imperfections."
2.0,Smaller then it looks and it does turn lighter colored fur dark but does do it's job and looks nice
2.0,"Maybe some can fit in this and enjoy this skirt but it definitely wasn't for me.<br /><br />I'm 5'4&#34; and 120 lbs...It was definitely way too large for me and I felt as though I was wearing a thick table cloth. The fabric definitely looks beautiful and the concept is great but I wish that this was made from material that's less stiff.<br /><br />Overall, I feel like someone way taller could rock this skirt out if they don't mind wearing heavier materials."
2.0,"Fit was too boxy for me, so I sent it back."
2.0,THEY DONT STAY ON THE FOOT
2.0,returned fit was way off
2.0,"I wanted so much to like this product!  The material feels really nice, but it just doesn't fit well.  It definitely does not for like in the picture."
2.0,Wish I could have kept it bug it runs extremely large. Like a dress
2.0,The shirts loose and longer than the one in the pic .
2.0,Ordered a size large but fits like small
2.0,"I returned this dress, as it fit ok but was really tight in strange areas, had absolutely no give to it. Bell sleeves but they were loose and baggy. Overall strange fit."
2.0,I feel like if I wash it it's going to fall apart
2.0,One of the bands came off the clip that slides onto the watch. Literally the next day after wearing it. Really not worth the money.
2.0,"Cute style, thin material, too short for me. I returned it."
2.0,[[VIDEOID:c3e4b5cb59b142dd886bbe5c82cd168b]] Don't waste ur money it's sewn on wrong straps not where shown not flattering very cheap zipper barely works even if it was a good fit and sewn right I would return maybe order a small if u have large breast that are some how very perky or wear an extreme push up I prefer bra less if not it's like a pouch to carry things ha ha I'm a 34 b
2.0,"This is very simply a mesh veil. The picture suggests that it is stiff and stands up, but the material is very limp and lays more like a shawl. If you are looking for a thin cover up, this will do, but item does not function as pictured."
2.0,I purchased a Medium and it felt like a Small. The fabric felt cheap and it itchy.<br /><br />Refund was quick.
2.0,It felt backwards . i dont think it was made podperlyw
2.0,"I have no idea how this fits because it didn’t come Close to fitting. I got XL, and I would say this is closer to a medium. They might have been cute and looked ok, but the sizes are not American. Fail."
2.0,The rose gold didn't match
2.0,"The with of these is too narrow.  I am a larger man. 6'3&#34;.  It definitely holds the pocket square in place, but the pocket square looks oddly narrow in my suit jacket.  I don't recommend this one for larger men."
2.0,"Most of the socks where nice and fit as expected.  However, like mentioned in other reviews, the purple socks were so much smaller than the rest, I could not even get them halfway onto my foot, so 2 of the 12 pairs of socks are unusable."
2.0,My order was the wrong size I ordered a small but received a medium.
2.0,"It's ok as a single loupe on a frame. But, since the focal point seems to be about 3/4 of an inch in front of the loupe, I'm not sure why there are 2 in a stereoscopic setup. There is no way you can see through both at once since the item needs to be so close to the lense. I hadn't done enough research yet to know that a 20x magnifying loupe would have such a short focal length."
2.0,The product looks like cotton or something but is made of bathing suit material. Way too small.
2.0,Absolutely adorable dress.  I love it.  Went by size chart and still ordered a size larger than I usually wear and this is too small.  I wear a size L and ordered an XL and honestly probably need an XXL.  Ridiculously small. :(
2.0,"I was pretty amazed how warm, soft and cozy these are. They came in a cute little box. They also came with a potent, horrid, toxic chemical smell. I had to put them away immediately - they burned my eyes and made my mouth feel gross. I had to put them in a bag immediately. I can’t imagine how it is for the folks who have to make these, being around those chemicals all the time. I hope the smell will wash out.<br /><br />These look a bit like full-leg crew socks - thick, opaque, ribbed. But warm!"
2.0,Great bag but it did not arrived on time
2.0,It was very thin
2.0,Beautiful but 2 stars because not big enough for my hai
2.0,"The watch itself looked great. Felt good. Weight seemed nice. But the screen was very dim. So dim that you couldn't view straight on, but an angle. And even at an angle, it was difficult to see the info on the display. I called Nixon, and while they were pretty responsive, they told me there was nothing they could do and noticed that's how it was designed. If that's the case, perhaps it needs to be stated and depicted as such. In the end, I returned it."
2.0,Picture could have been a little better and wished the size would have been on web site. Ended up taken off the flowers and using them in a shell/candle mop tray.
2.0,This feels really uncomfortable on the skin. It's has this scratchy feeling when i wear nothing underneath. It's very warm especially when i wear a coat over it. It's short around the waist.
2.0,"I purchased the khaki color flannel and expected a soft, warm material based on the pictures and some of the reviews, but this was nothing like that. The pattern itself is similar, but the colors are off. The material was stiff and scratchy, and it looked like I had giant shoulder pads on. The style was definitely not as expected, and I would not recommend purchasing."
2.0,So it only fits a tad big but the glue all around the sides is what upsets like why don't people check items before mailing out.
2.0,Too tight and the design while wide and can hold tickets money and passport . In two airport trips it proved it was more of a hassle then a quick grab
2.0,This product was a bit too rugged for me as I prefer a soft and supple leather.  It is also very large and very heavy.  I will be donating it.
2.0,Not good for ladies with large breasts even if you’re not very large overall. Too tight & small.
2.0,Super cute shirt but it’s too big and does not look right on
2.0,uncomfortable and difficult to keep in place.
2.0,"Didn’t come with a string to tie around the waist, so it is very loose and not very flattering."
2.0,Got this buff for my mum to use as a mask but it is not stretchy at all. Do not buy.
2.0,"Need to know the inside dimensions. Not the outside. Everyone is putting the outside. Looking for the inside dimensions to be no less than 6 inches length, but thing to fit in a dress shirt pocket."
2.0,This was too large
2.0,"These earrings are the same color as the picture and very cute.  So, I was really disappointed when I received them.  They are huge and very heavy.  The pic makes them appear almost huggie size.  They are not.  And did I mention how heavy they are?  Uncomfortably so."
2.0,Bad quality material. Runs small
2.0,"The build quality feels great, its got weight and the metallic finishes look nice.<br /><br />The problem is the glass arrived cracked, I expect due to manufacturer defect as the wings cover the glass from damage.<br /><br />If it wasn't from china I would exchange, it took 1.5 months to receive, so forget that."
2.0,Comfy gown great length beautiful design but the elastic completely ruins it. Ugh so upset because it was amazing otherwise.
2.0,I only received 18 and one of them had a missing ball so only 17 really. they look nice tho I just wish there were 20 as said on the picture
2.0,Good quality but not true to size. Cesar a really good facsimile but my 5X is a 2X at best.
2.0,"I was lead to believe in the picture and description of this product, I would be receiving a total of 4 masks w/PM 2.5 materials as well as replacement PM 2.5 material for them! I was EXTREMELY UPSET when the package contained only one mask! I will not be buying anything else from you due to the false advertisement!"
2.0,Way bigger that expected
2.0,"The belt was missing, so that was really disappointing. SHEIN has great, quality clothes, but this is not one of them. The material is very thin, cheap and snagged within the first hour of me wearing it. The pattern is nice, just like the picture. The arms are very tight."
2.0,I hate the material and the waste band is to thick....after wearing once the elastic is twisting! I probably won't be wearing them a second  time.
2.0,"After 5 day! One pair lost A lens, the frame is not broken and it’s impossible to place the lens back on. The other pair is working quite well! Maybe a defective one?"
2.0,I was very disappointed in this purchase. The skull on the bandana was printed crooked. Poor quality even for the low price.
2.0,Way too big and looks cheap
2.0,Not sure why this is called a sweatshirt when it's just the same weight as a T-shirt. Arrived inside a plastic bag but even inside a bag it had a weird crusty food smudge on the front.
2.0,"The top was short, wide and baggy which I guess I should have realized from reviews and the photo."
2.0,"The top was a little too small and the bottoms were a little too large. Also, the bottoms come up so high it almost looks more like a one piece on me. I would have returned it but I missed the deadline to get my money back."
2.0,Went based off the size guide lines got a Medium I am 5’5 and 123lbs it fit a bit tight on both my legs and bottom area. (I’m also very skinny on bottom not thick) They are amazing on holding tummy but they also ripped on my bottom area first hour into wearing them and had tiny rips on legs. Totally disappointed specially for the price. Should be at least $8 if they are a one time wear.
2.0,Cute necklace but too long for my teenagers neck.  I had to remove 2 shells and tie for it to fit properly. Cute necklace but not “choker size”
2.0,Ordered black and grey got teal and navy.
2.0,"I'm kind of upset about the fact that it states in the product details that it will fit up to a 38 and up to a C cup, but I just received them and they don't fit. I could barely fit it over and everything bulged out the sides! These definitely do not fit a 38C. I will be returning sadly, cause I really loved the idea of this bra!"
2.0,"Good feel, but the top is not strong enough to say up.  Slides down."
2.0,Cute shoes but only one of them actually lights up... not sure if there’s any easy fix but kind of a bummer
2.0,"Great fit everywhere but the waist, order a size bigger. I  wear a 10/12 and ordered the large and could no where close to zip them up."
2.0,Bought a brown and a black. Brown was a terrible lemon that releases any time I'm not 100% vertical. Very satisfied with the black. 50% isn't bad these days I guess.
2.0,Not good sizing.
2.0,"Great product, but to small, even the xxl runs small. Otherwise i love em"
2.0,The material is rough and cheap. Not very comfortable. Runs small.
2.0,"This is a thin, polyester, blazer-like material that wrinkles easliy.  This would not be water-resistant but is also not breathable.  I normally wear a M-L and this M was very big and baggy on me, not fitting at all.  It's a very simple design but the red color is fairly accurate and looks nice. I will be returning because I wanted a rain jacket for a trip to the northeast and it's far too baggy (but the sleeves are still too short for my liking)."
2.0,"Very cute while it lasted, but the cord isn't great quality and it broke."
2.0,Found these glasses very cheaply made....I have another pair of Coach glasses that I ordered in the past and found to be very high quality...
2.0,Thin and not made well. The large us extremely baggy but the sleeves are too short. I'll be returning this.
2.0,"I wore it for the second time just days after the return limit. If you need a cheap dress you can only wear once, this is the one for you. I work at an office/teacher type job so not much movement. Got a giant rip in the seam of the skirt part, which is conveniently located straight down the middle of your behind. This also happened in the middle of the work day.<br /><br />It's surprised me because I'm on the petite side and the dress fits a little loose in that area so there was no stretching. Hope you're a good seamstress."
2.0,The necklace is waaaay too thin for my purpose
2.0,no compression whatsoever
2.0,Shipping was awesome but everything else NOT. The waist is down by the hips. ITS NOT TRUE TO SIZE. Please don't listen to the reviews that say it is. I wear a xl but I buy xxl or xxxl online when following reviews. Since it said true to size I got a xxl an its Too small should have stuck to the xxxl like I was in the beginning.
2.0,OK fit; I prefer shorts that stop above the knee.. Item is as advertised. Unfortunately the belt doesn't work properly and doesn't look as if it belongs with these shorts.  Belt is of such poor quality that it should have been left out.  I will field test the shorts and see how they hold up.
2.0,Super comfy good quality socks but they shrunk down to child size after first wash
2.0,The socks are nice. What's not nice is that I'm missing 3 of the 6 pairs!
2.0,"Not thrilled with them at all, does not fit right"
2.0,"Initially I was a big fan of the case. Worked well, held 4 cards or so. About 3 months in the bottom ripped out of the credit card holder just from daily use. Looked and felt great while it was intact but the longevity of the product isn't that great. Wouldn't recommend."
2.0,They are pretty and came very quickly.  But the metal irritated my ears.
2.0,Cheaply made ergo cheap price.
2.0,"This product is cut poorly, boxy, and thin. One could not wear this in public for fear of seeing private parts.<br /><br />I’m very disappointed. I sized-up per recommendations and that was a regret. The product is poorly executed although the ideal was great! Stay far far away!"
2.0,Didn't like the material. Too thin.
2.0,To start out they were comfortable but after wearing a few times they began to dig into my back and side.
2.0,"They were pretty but, unfortunately, they arrived broken."
2.0,"and asked what she was supposed to do with it. Even though she wears a medium, it didn't seem to be large enough to close properly. I didn't realize at the time that it was a robe for sleepwear and told her it was a long sweater. It was thin material and didn't resemble sleepwear at all."
2.0,While the ring is cute... It looks nothing like the featured picture MUCH CHEAPER to be exact... Although it was only 20.00 it's still want worth it
2.0,They were too small with no stretch room
2.0,Don’t expect it to be a standard size! It runs very small!
2.0,Too tight and short for size large. I can wear large and medium and they were tighter than what my mediums usually are.
2.0,The corners are sharp and it turned my arm green
2.0,This was not the Raglan long sleeve t shirt jersey that is described.
2.0,"Based on previous reviews, I bought a size up (Large) from what I usually do. I am glad that I did, because the sleeves were just about right, which means the sleeves on a medium would have been tight. I also found that there was stray stitching sticking out from the side seam of the dress, and some of the seams were not exactly straight. In addition, the neckline is rather high, looking more like a men's t-shirt than a deeper V-neckline that would flatter a woman. I like that the dress has pockets, but I am disappointed overall."
2.0,"The idea to my mind for a belt from a purely pragmatic standpoint is to make sure your trousers don’t creep slowly down your backside and ultimately prevent you from showing your undergarments to passersby.  Much like any belt that aim is achieved through the currently en Vogue ratchet system.  Its primary duty however is hampered by the sheer heft of the buckle.  In the picture a minimal reproduction of the traditional strap and buckle, in reality a massive Texas-sized contraption of mechanical might.  It would in the near future dystopian world we may live in be a very functional and durable weapon and is probably better suited to bludgeoning rather than pants-holder-upping."
2.0,It came early and was amazing at first but the beads all fell off on one side. The gems glued on also are starting to fall off as well and I have used it only in my house 3 times.
2.0,"Some of the lowest quality tanks I have ever come in contact with. The scoops in the center of the neck did not even line up with my belly button. The sides ride way too high and after washing, they shrink and unbelievable amount. AWFUL"
2.0,"The cardigan is definitely a different product than the one advertised. First of all the sleeves are not long like they are in the picture. They are 3/4 length. Also, the color is completely different. I ordered  apricot, which looks like a apricot pink in the picture, the one I received is more of a natural white/ light beige."
2.0,This was not a cool cotton and in fact I question if it is cotton.  It feels like polyester.  It also fits very small.
2.0,"Nice weight, nice size. Should be good and stable BUT beware of the pins! The backs aren’t secure and don’t hold the pins. There are generally two per pin on the set of three pins. After a few minutes of wearing the first pin for the first time within 5 minutes the back had fallen off and we weren’t able to find it. So we were headed to JoAnns anyway and my husband decided to go ask whether they had the type of backs needed to replace the one we lost and they did and the new backs fit tight and stayed on. Turns out it was a good decision because at least half of the backs were so lose the pins couldn’t be worn safely. My only other thought to improve is that the pin front is all one color so the message doesn’t stand out visually. Some contrast and highlighting would improve the readability of the message and the fun of wearing the pins."
2.0,"It's way too long. The actual product was good and it the metal was smooth, but there's no way to be able to flip it up to hide it."
2.0,I was a nice dress but the pattern faded when stretched over my bust.
2.0,Bought an extra large & it came down to my knees. Just a little too large for me. Fit good in the shoulders though.
2.0,"The back was beautiful, but the fit of the dress is so fitted, I felt like it tugged at every bra/panty line and didn't create a smooth silhouette.  I returned it, but perhaps it just wasn't for me.  The other ladies who bought this item and posted photos looks beautiful."
2.0,Nicely made...cant get it on.  Way to small even after I ordered a larger side.
2.0,Find something else.
2.0,"Not easy on,or easy off."
2.0,"They are not adult sized. Very small earrings, tore my ears up trying to wear them. Decided to keep them as a gift for granddaughter."
2.0,"Don't want to be sued for ""false accusations"" so I'll just say, ""What you see, may not be exactly what you get. The whole ""3D pop"" effect didn't show up out of the package."
2.0,"I really wanted to love these pants, but couldn’t get one leg in. Ordered the largest size, but too small. Other items from this brand fit well. Sad these didn’t fit, even on the largest available."
2.0,"They aren't the best nose rings , they are kind of flimsy and come in cheap plastic bag."
2.0,"This was purchased in a larger size to allow for longer wear, but the zipper broke after a season and a half.  Disappointed to have to purchase another winter coat for my kiddo."
2.0,Large and baggy for a small. To much hassle to return.
2.0,El cuello es horrible
2.0,The watch and is really attractive in appearance but it is falling apart after four months of wear.
2.0,"I was hopping for better quality. It's ok, but I'm a little nervous about wearing it as I'm allergic to most things. The stone looks really plasticy :("
2.0,"These fit SUPER small. They look cheap, as well. More in line with the under $5 sunglasses I've purchased. I wouldn't spend $13 on these."
2.0,"Very cheap fabric. I purchased a medium in another brand &#34;Code Happy&#34; and it fits perfect. I'm still wearing some older Cherokee items in a medium that fit. Again, made in a third world country and the size do not interface."
2.0,"The fit and comfort were great, however the fabric catches and pulls very easily. Once a pull starts, it will turn into a full sized run quickly, especially after washing."
2.0,"not as long as shown. when knotted, it comes only upto my breasts. Plan on giving it to my niece"
2.0,Slippers were returned for a larger size.
2.0,Gave me wrong shirt. I wanted purple shirt not the rose one. Unhappy. Fits find. And the other shirt I order a medium size not small.
2.0,"I like the hat, but the front of the hat is entirely too high. It's sits weird on top of the head. Its a nice hat just one I won't wear."
2.0,"I bought it for a friend but she didn't like how big it looked when she had it in. She didn't say it hurt but she didn't have it long enough probably to tell.<br /><br />When I returned it, it needed the package to return it. So I ended up having to pay for a return package after buying it."
2.0,Love this but the quality is questionable.  The back falls off when I pull up to my desk the necklace barley bumps the desk and the thing falls apart. Bummed. ..
2.0,"They look nice, but feel cheap. I bought them for my 15 year old daughter. She wore them to school in the snow and they were not water proof at all!! They soaked her feet and I had to go to the school and bring her new socks and her old boots. What good are snowboots if they are not water proof? I gave them 2 stars because from far away they look cute."
2.0,Material was very thin. Legs were way too long and it just me right.
2.0,"The picture makes it look like an actual fob watch, it is not.  The chain is the only metal part on this watch.  The voice and sounds that come from it sound like they were recorded in a metal trash can and are being played back through a speaker wrapped in cellophane.  I am so disappointed in what a piece of junk this thing is.  This thing should be sold for $[...] not $[...]!  I gets 2 stars for at least having the Dr. Who design on it and because it can possibly be used as a prop."
2.0,"Great wallet, but the outside band of material came in looking like the seam hadn't been fixed down or, as I initially thought, had been accidentally cut by a boxcutter. Over the next day, the glue came loose and the band popped up. I do like the wallet, especially the slot for your phone and the fact that the case is a hard shell and feels very sturdy."
2.0,"While it is cute it's waaay to small.  I ordered a size up because I knew that the measurements would still not be accurate for me, but it's still too small. Oh well.  I may just try to exchange it for another bigger size."
2.0,"Sadly this are paper thin. I haven another cloth mask purchased from Amazon that cost $22 for one mask. It’s fantastic.<br />This pack cheap, but pretty, and of questionable effectiveness."
2.0,Sleeve design is not good
2.0,It fits great but the problem is it's see through I order the white shirt. Going to return it.  Sad to say I can't wear it
2.0,Way too big...
2.0,No tiene buen terminado
2.0,"The &#34;boning &#34; has come thru the seem of the pleather, this is the first time i put it on. Its very comfortable and soft on the skin side."
2.0,Runs very small. Fits like a crop top. Not recommended for the Busty. A disappointment.
2.0,These looked lovely and exactly as pictured when they arrived . But broke the first time I tried them on... I was able to glue the earring together and it held up for the night. But wouldn’t recommend spending your money on something so flimsy
2.0,"The watch came with all the parts, but it was not assembled. Only one side of the wristband was attached properly. No tools are included for buyer to properly assemble. I am disappointed because now we have to go take it and potentially spend more money to fix an issue that should never have been. I would rather have paid more for the usable product."
2.0,Broke the first time I  had it on. Very much  disappointed.  Hope to get it fixed
2.0,"Liked the style, the fabric weight, and the colors. But, smaller in the chest than expected. Had to return. May try ordering a size up."
2.0,bigger than I thought and heavy. leather not soft
2.0,"First,I ordered a small and received a medium.  So, the shirt is too large.  It is also dingy looking and not white as shown in picture.  The shirt I received and this picture do NOT appear to be the same shirt."
2.0,"The slipper socks were cute as a button, but...misleading sizing! They are said to fit women's sizes 9-11. I wear size 9 1/2 so I felt I would be a shoe (or sock) in as far as size was concerned. Not so however, as they are so short I cannot use them. I did not return, but will give them to my granddaughter instead."
2.0,Couldn’t tell you how it fit because it was too small. I wouldn’t recommend buying something like this from Amazon because the sizing is always off. Completely off!!
2.0,Very Dissapointed!! Runs large and looks like crap on!
2.0,Was pretty broke when I tried it on
2.0,"I love the color! But it came with two tiny holes in the front, so I won’t be able to wear it but I threw out all the packaging so I can’t even return it. The material is pretty flimsy."
2.0,Way overpriced!! I could have made these myself and for cheaper. So disappointed.
2.0,This dress looked like a bag on me. It was too big. Does not look like the picture at all.
2.0,not as much tummy control as I expected
2.0,"It’s measurements are fine around, but for anyone who’s semi-tall it’s way too short. I had to add 6” of material just to make it comfortable...I’m only 5’8”..."
2.0,The numbers are extremely hard to read.....so there is a light button to press which happens to be green.....for the price im not expecting a smart watch i was expecting a watch that i can see the time and date with an LCD screen...very disappointed...also the snap on piece came off within two days of wearing it...smh
2.0,They are uncomfortable…rubbed blisters on my toes and heels
2.0,"This product does not meet the expectations as it shows the butterflies nicely centered. However, on the real mask, it’s not centered.  It’s printed on both corners and you can barely tell it’s a butterfly. Also, doesn’t feel as soft as regular masks do."
2.0,Would love to give this a better review but broke putting it on. One string popped and went everywhere. It is really cute and the charms are darling. Think I’ll salvage the charms for another band
2.0,"Loved the fabric and color.  But sizing is not suitable for a petite person. Ordered a Large, I'm a 14 heavy. It was too tight to breath. Returned amd reordered an XLarge, it fit everywhere but in the shoulders.  About 2 extra inches above the shoulders causing large gaps. Sad had to return it too. Really wamted this dress to fit."
2.0,Even black is too sheer and fit is not truly tunic length.
2.0,I was looking forward to these glasses but they are not clear but rather a obvious and ugly yellow lens. I wanted to see crystal clear through these but the color I see looking through these is foul. I am very displeased and I am seriously considering returning them. The frames are cute and very different looking but I like that about them hence the 2 stars.
2.0,didn't like how they came in on the shoulders
2.0,"The fit for a small is more like xs.  Other than that, looks cute and good material.  I would order up a size. 2 sizes for a loose fit."
2.0,"Cute Dress/Shirt~Way Too HUGE.....I was getting ready to go on a trip, which is why I purchased this shirt/dress – although it was HUGE, so I had no choice but to return it for a full-refund!"
2.0,These are def super cute. They are soft unlike some brands. They do show good definition of your butt. Mine got 2 holes first day I wore them
2.0,"Watch face did not seat back in properly after I removed it to set the time.  Battery was dead, so I returned it."
2.0,"What you receive isn't quite like what you expect. no matter which way you wear the shirt, it looks like it is inside out. The quality is poor. It costs more to return it then to keep it. I'd recommend just paying a couple extra dollars and getting something wearable.  The other day I finally used it for the first time.  I was tired mid-day and draped it over my eyes to block out the sun.  I think this is a better use for it than wearing it."
2.0,These are way too big and thin to be actually usefull.
2.0,"Clearly the size chart is too small for American males, such as myself."
2.0,The bars are almost too short for a belly button. Hard to screw on ball
2.0,"Pretty, but I had to glue the stones on straight out of the package."
2.0,"Some fit to small others to large and only 2 fit just right, one off the major problems is when they get pushed to hard they let go right on the seams (getting out the car and riiiiip) and that was the ones that fit large."
2.0,Cheap and is only going to look good on someone shaped like the model
2.0,I'll be honest - it's kind of ugly. It's not horrible; maybe it's jsut not my taste.  Looks better in the pic than in person. Would not buy again.
2.0,Sent it back. Despite what the manufacturer's claim it does have glare when wearing it in the sun. It also doesn't seem to be able to bend as claimed is ad.
2.0,"Runs small, cheaply made, too small for my 4 year old."
2.0,Socks are well made but ‘fits size 6 to 11’? Don’t think so. I’d say the largest shoe size (comfortably) would be 9.5. Fortunately my wife can wear these or I’d have sent them back.
2.0,Item is very cheaply made and about half the size as it appears it would be online.  It's actually about the same size as an infant receiving blanket.  Will not buy again..
2.0,"This dress is VERY short waisted.  It is gorgeous but, fits weird.  Size was right but made for a petite person."
2.0,I bought this for my wife butTo small for her wrist. But fit my 11 year old
2.0,"I really didn't think it was cute. It might be nice if you were feeling sick or needed a light later on your head, like in the hospital or something? I'm not sure. It was a nice lightweight material similar to Jersey/soft t-shirt material. I liked that, but it just didn't look right on me."
2.0,"Looks very good, but it doesn't hold much... the details on the logo are very good.  Wish they would describe the holding capacity."
2.0,I am an adult woman and these did not fit my face at all. Very awkward to wear. Only way they would fit is if I pulled it all the way over the top of my ears and even then the top was pretty much in my eyes. The great price and colorful patterns seemed great but big disappointment overall unfortunately.
2.0,I got a 48D and it fits more like a C and the 48 is smaller than a 44C i have
2.0,Arms too tight. Gave to my granddaughter. Seller should know when a U.S. plus size gal purchases an XXXL to XXXXL they are expecting the item to fit. Plus means plus! Please adjust your patterns people!
2.0,"When I first got this I liked it so much that I bought almost every style, every color of this brand. BUT, after wearing the first couple and then washing them, I wish I hadn’t wasted my money. The material on every one of them pills really badly and they look like they have been worn many times. I can’t even wear some of them a second time because they look so bad. Don’t waste your money on these unless you like disposable clothing.<br />The photos show the front of the shirt after wearing it one time."
2.0,materialgood
2.0,"This one wraps like a wrap dress, but the material is paper thin. Super thin. Like linen, but not as thick.  The other issue is the sizing. I'm 5'7, wear a 22/24 (more like a 24 in a dress), so I ordered the 5x. It's still too tight in the bust. The rest is okay, but I can't wear it because it's too shear. I would have to head to toe wear some sort of slip or something, and who does that anymore?  Just very very cheap material, not well made and something I gave to charity.<br /><br />Pro:  The design and color are nice.<br /><br />Con: Too tight and way too flimsy to wear as a dress. Maybe a beach cover-up of some kind, but definitely not a dress, unless you're into showing all your goodies to the world.<br /><br />Verdict: Do not recommend."
2.0,"When I saw it, I thought the knot on the side was really cute, but it kept bunching up, which I didn't like at all."
2.0,Nucita is my favorite and would have ordered again and again but last order contained only one pack instead of 2.
2.0,"I ordered larger than usual, still too snug"
2.0,"This dress goes all the way to the floor. I thought the pic looked like it had a shorter front. The fabric is very wrinkly and gauze like. It runs very small in the chest. I had to return it. The color is fabulous, though."
2.0,Logo faded fast
2.0,"It is too large to wear especially on the armpit area. The lenght of the sleeves it too long. Please note that I usually wear Large, but even though I ordered Medium size basing on others review it is still too large for me."
2.0,Light material and too short for me. Rides up too. Wont buy again.
2.0,"I was very excited to receive this yoga jumpsuit. Unfortunately I won't be using it for yoga or going out in public period. The garment is very poorly made. The material is thin Jersey that is see through before you even put it on your body and its nothing like a yoga fabric. The legs on this item are also insanely long. I am 5'9"" with a 33.5"" inseam and they were still a good 4"" too long for me. Maybe I will be able to use them as a layer under Jean's for particularly cold days, or as tights under a skirt, but buyer beware, if you wear these to a yoga class, they're going to kick you out for indecent exposure!"
2.0,"Returning item , to small and it smells like chemicals the smell is pretty strong. I let it air out for over a week as nd it still smells. This was going to be a gift. However the person I was gifting it to is allergic to chemicals and chemical smells. I specifically bought this one because it mentioned  No Smells. I should have know if it had to mention about the smell in the 1st place. I should have known not to buy it.<br />I still haven't returned it yet. Just waiting for the time. I did buy a similar one that I really liked. As did my friend.  So I'm happy in the end"
2.0,"These are for skinny-legged people. I was hoping, as a diabetic, to find socks that didn't cause red creases on my legs.  These are not the socks for my purpose. Will have to give them away. They are sturdy socks."
2.0,Cute dress.  I ordered an xl and it was more like a longer shirt.  Just covered my butt.
2.0,I love the fit but I've worn it 3 times and there are already multiple holes in both of the sleeves. I was very disappointed in the quality.
2.0,"I received this item as a gift to help local children in need.  I am so grateful!  The backpacks are better quality than would be expected for the price.  They actually look pretty nice in person too, except for the Moda West wording which cheapens them.<br /><br />What I do NOT like and what would keep me from purchasing them again is the HIGHLY toxic smell.  The smell is so strong that we are washing them before gifting them.  I'm sure some community in China has a high rate of cancer due to manufacturing these.<br /><br />Also, some of the stitching is iffy, loose threads, etc.  (But maybe that's not too surprising for the price).<br /><br />We have 3 other brands of backpacks to donate to the kids sitting at my house (JanSport, Amazon Basics, Ruipai) and none of them smell and all are better quality.  Sometimes you get what you pay for.  Without the chemical smell, these would have been 4 stars at least (considering the low price),  so I hope the manufacturer takes note and can change how they are producing them."
2.0,"First the length isn't anywhere near the 17"" they have listed in the size chart the XL was 13.5"". I got the XL because I normally wear a US Medium (for reference I'm 5'10"" and 140lbs and a proud member of the Itty-bitty titty committee) and this top barely covers my bra. Secondly, it has an odd shape. Maybe mine was just a mess up with the pattern but the neck games open even though it's tight everywhere else, one sleeve is noticeably longer than the other and the arm holes (around the armpit area not the bottom of the sleeve) are so tight it will cut off the circulation to your arms. Other than that it's about what you'd expect for the price. The fabric is soft but it's thick so it looks cheaper and the cuts need some DIY attention to not look like they were just cut... all of which I expect for the price but the ill-fit and wonky pattern makes it a NO for me."
2.0,"It's a little big for my 3 year old but he loves trucks so he still wants to wear it all the time. I was hoping it would shrink a little in the dryer but it didn't. Also, some of the threads are already falling apart."
2.0,"The pendant, in reality, is much smaller than it appears in the pictures."
2.0,Were cheep looking and disappointed in the look and material
2.0,"Nice looking watch. Main hands work with no issues. The three smaller faces work intermittently, with majority of time not working. This was why two stars. If that does not bother you then this is a nice looking watch that keeps accurate time."
2.0,Product not made well. Lens fall out. Very cheap.
2.0,"I’m not sure if mine was made differently than the other reviewers? But the straps were so long, it didn’t cover my bust. And usually long straps are ok because I have a very large bust. But this was excessively long. And then on top of that, I ordered a size up to make sure it wasn’t clingy and tight (I bought it to wear in the hospital after delivery) and it was still too clingy and tight! I had to send it back."
2.0,"It was a very cute dress but it was really small. I am 4'11 and weigh 125 lb and the small was too short and a bit tight. I couldn't wear it for Halloween. Plus, there is no whistle or socks included in this outfit. Size small is a size for a woman with no hips, no breasts, ​and no height."
2.0,"Colors are not as vibrant as pictured , kind of faded out"
2.0,Works great the first week then all of a sudden the lights stop working.  Some work and some don't.
2.0,Very disappointed. The ad for this bra makes it seem just about perfect but not so fast. The pads do not stay in place and slide around giving the bra a very uneven and embarrassing look. The pads also appear to be a brighter white than the fabric of the rest of the bra which made them look a bit like a bullseye in a target. I may try to remove the pads since they aren't usable but it will make the bra more suited for sleeping at best.
2.0,I bought one size smaller than I normally buy and they are still too large
2.0,Looks cheaper than what I was expecting
2.0,"End up to my 12 year old step daughter, she wears small-medium. I bought xx-large super tight bust area."
2.0,"the screws loosen constantly.  Loved the glasses, but impractical when having to constantly fix."
2.0,The fit is great however the quality is not. I have worn these twice and they are already getting holes at the seams.
2.0,"First let me say the glasses are nice and stylish.  I received them as a Christmas present.  I was very happy with them and they work fine.  However, I do wish I could give them 2.5 stars.<br /><br />Here's the problem, I was given them to primarily use during cycling.  I'm a very active rider so I need glasses like these.  The problem is the nose guards.  That is the place where the glasses rest on your nose.  They are pieces separate from the body of the glasses.  So they can and have fallen off.  Well that basically renders the glasses useless.  I contacted Arsenal and they were nice to offer to replace them.  Between the fees and the shipping, not to mention my time, my wife was like you're better off just buying a new pair from somebody else that doesn't have this defect issue.<br /><br />Again, there okay.  I just wish the problem would've come up sooner so I could have addressed it more quickly.  And having to pay 90%+ of the costs just to get new nose pieces isn't worth it.  I hope whoever buys them has better luck than me.  (NOTE: this review was written by my husband)"
2.0,The ankles are very baggy.
2.0,I was expecting bigger charms. It’s hard to even see what’s written on them.
2.0,The “B” for Boston peeled off the sweats after two washes - was not put in the dryer.  Disappointed in this product!
2.0,"Not waterproof, battery died so fast, started losing its color."
2.0,The ring fits great and is super stylish. I've worn it for 1 week and received so many compliments. Unfortunately like I said after only 1 week it is starting to show wear and the color is coming off. Super disappointing as the ring is great otherwise. I've worn several other brands for years and they still look new.
2.0,"This came in and I didn't even try on the bottoms, the top was so small I couldn't zip it up. I ordered according to their size chart. Very disappointing."
2.0,Not the finest quality but it was very cheap so it's about what I expected. Already frayed after 1 week.
2.0,"Really cute, they do not stay in place."
2.0,They could be really amazing. Super soft comfy shoes. BUT. The top of the sole is uneven so kinda weird to walk in. I wouldn’t buy again
2.0,"so small, hard to see when you were them."
2.0,Got a hole in the toe after one night of practice.  Toe nails were short and socks were on a 7 yo.
2.0,A standard business card will not fit in the holder.  There is no plastic cover over the cardboard tag.  The attachment straps will come loose with airport baggage handling.  I suggest you look for a better product.
2.0,The print is 1 side not both sides then it wS dark blue on back then scarf darker then shown. I bought a lighter color what I got cause they reduced it maybe. It had no tag was like a art project. We all know scarves usually have SAME print both sides. This was awful but I just kept instead of mailing back. But nothappy with and haven't even used it so far.
2.0,The first day I wore this it started to shred like rubber band PCs sticking out which make it look cheap and poorly made<br />I love the color and really hope they make the band stronger.  I was afraid it would break and I would lose my $550.00 watch attached
2.0,"Bought this for a Halloween costume, am missing the hair scrunchie."
2.0,Very thin material and poorly sewn. The gloves seams started coming apart within minutes of putting them on.
2.0,.Seem cheap and can't see that well with them.  They get smeared very easily.
2.0,I'm sorry is this a joke  Their knee highs  I spend a lot of money on nylons and never have been disappointed until now I mean they are nice knee highs but not what I ordered
2.0,"I am disappointed in the quality of this dress, especially after reading all of the great reviews on here. I got the navy dress with floral skirt. Looks wise, it is super cute. But looking up close when I have it on, that is where the problems start. Where the waist is-where the two different top and skirt materials are sewn together, it sags in the front and back, and the seam comes up on both sides. The navy top is so sheer, I really need to wear something underneath it-but what do you layer underneath a dress top? I wanted to love this dress, and maybe the solid colors are better quality than the printed ones."
2.0,I bought 25 of these in pink as a bridal shower favor because they look so pretty in the picture. So disappointed when they arrived. They look cheap - definitely not worth $10. Maybe they would be ok for dress-up or part of a costume but I certainly wouldn't wear it out. They're on their way back to Amazon!
2.0,Too short for mens athletic shoes.
2.0,"I was dying to get this and when I did it looked awfully small, but so cute and it fit. I screwed the top piece on pretty tight and the next day it had come off?!?"
2.0,Very small sizes. Ordered twice and still too small
2.0,"They look very nice and great value but have an awful gas like rubber smell that I can’t get out. When I move my hand to my face, I can smell it. At first I thought it was some sort of gas leak but found later that it was these bands."
2.0,"i received something different from what was advertised, similar but different.See the picture I took (front & back have the same prints. Im returning this product."
2.0,These were microscopic and poorly constructed. I returned them.
2.0,"Cute and convenient! But after one month of use, the face snapped off the back (clip part) and was lost as I walked from one site to the next :("
2.0,"Before I bought this keychain I read a review that said the heart broke off a week after they had it. I liked it so much that I decided  I would take my chances. Sadly, the same thing happened to me exactly one week after I had it. I was so sad. It's a really cute keychain. I really hope that the company can figure out how to fix this problem."
2.0,"fabric wasn't what it looks like in the pic, disappointed. Won't ever buy from a label on Amazon again that I don't already know personally."
2.0,"Out of the box one motor did not work, which means it didn't get in the air. I received this as a birthday present from my grandkids.What a rush killer.  I have purchased 100's of choppers over the past 5 yrs. Luckily this is the first that was bad out of the box.However it is a good looking quad, but I would have preferred seeing it in the air.  Not Happy,Falcon"
2.0,Beautiful but the chain turned black in one day
2.0,Purchased this for my daughter for Christmas. It literally looked like a potato bag cut to something of a dress.  Returned.
2.0,I was not able to use these masks for my 9 year old because they are too small/tight. They are probably good for kids upto 4-5 years of age.
2.0,"Fit way to small , very disappointed . I got a medium ."
2.0,"I like the style and the quality of glasses.  However, they did not stop the glare for evening and did not help my husband see better for night driving.  We did not send back as he threw away the original box."
2.0,These did not eork for me. My Kerig would not acceot it. Save your money.
2.0,The material was loud when you moved. I wish I could explain it better but it was a material I have never worn before. I gave it away.
2.0,The front of the shoe messed up the first day my son wore them and he complains that the charger port on the side hurts his ankle.
2.0,"So I thought it would be a great idea to try these out, since I typically use a waist trimming belt while working out.  I fortunately and unfortunately was blessed with a decent size rear end, so I bought the largest size possible and I still struggled to get my self into them. I am typically a 32 measurement, so, I figured, if I buy the biggest size there should be any problem. Well, there was a problem after only wearing them TWICE, washing them THREE times.  I vegan to put them on for my next work out to see that the back of the right leg had began shredding/ripping like panty hose and then there was a hole forming in the crotch area.  Needless to say, I took them back off and in the trash can they went.  For others who are not has blessed in the rear end, but for people like me, well, find something else!"
2.0,Its super pretty. Loved that it was metal. My daughter has had two. Both broke in the same place within and hour of wear:(
2.0,After wearing only a couple of weeks the silver is rubbing off and the chain is black.<br />I tried polishing but it didn't help. Not  real silver probably just lightly coated
2.0,Turned my wrist green
2.0,"These are HUGE. They are not even close to what I consider child sized. They would easily fit a teenager, but not a younger child."
2.0,No my favorite broke out soon she try .not worty
2.0,Nice color.you can't you use it as a badge holder .<br />Zipper is not all the way . Not happy with it.
2.0,The advertisement is deceiving. Material quality is very poor.
2.0,"These shorts were packaged nicely and the c ok lor was beautiful. However the chart is not accurate, they wrere too small and very thin."
2.0,Very nice and thankful gift but didnt last long. Broke where the heart and metal twist to put on and off.
2.0,Love the fit for water aerobics and swimming. Unfortunately after just 6 months the fabric is thinning in several places and the suit needs to be replaced.
2.0,I ordered the right size but can a bit to small.
2.0,"I ordered 3 different belts from 3 different vendors on this order. I really liked the looks of the belt but it was only available in a medium as opposed to a small like I usually wear.  I don't like a lot of extra belt to tuck but for the price I would try it.  Wow, to my surprise this medium was actually 2&#34; smaller the the smalls I ordered.  I am thinking if this belt is really a medium, it must have been a girls medium and not a woman's.  It's a beautiful belt that I will never be able to wear...but for the price, I am not going to pay for return shipping, although I wish I knew what the situation was - because the belt really is nice."
2.0,"I bough this expecting it to be tunic length -- as depicted in the photo with the model. It just hits my waist, and I'm only 5'2"" tall. The intent was to wear it with leggings and it would cover my bottom, but that won't be possible. I'm keeping it since it's for a Halloween costume and I don't have time to return and order something else. But I was also hoping to wear it afterward with leggings and boots -- which won't happen. So just be aware that the actual shape is really short and boxy, and not long and lean looking as shown."
2.0,Came in brown not black
2.0,Craftsmanship was not the best.  The red and white of the flag were not printed on the left edge of the pad.
2.0,WAY too small. Fabric is very thin. Arrived in a wad shoved inside a ratty ziploc bag.
2.0,"The T-shirt itself is exactly what we expected, however size L 10/12 is definitely a Medium and not a Large.  It was way, way, way too short for my son."
2.0,I did not like it but great for the price
2.0,"I have purchased items by ouges before and have been happy with them. This particular style was not good.  This was returned.  Looked good on the model, not so good in real life."
2.0,"No where near the vibrant blue color shown in the photo. It's a light baby blue color. Very cheap looking, not worth the cost. Bummer! :("
2.0,"Unfortunately, it was nothing special."
2.0,I am pretty skinny and this fits tight on the back. I ordered a size up and still didn’t like how the back fit. Beautiful top though.
2.0,Hard to keep the liner and the outside material aligned. The inside liner tore within a couple weeks of having them.
2.0,"Very pretty, and very small.  I would have liked much more if they came in something besides a plastic bag.  Makes them look cheap. I would not BUY AGAIN!!!!!!!!"
2.0,Marginal. Buy a better one
2.0,There was nothing special about this bag. It didn’t have the rigid structure I was expecting. And the color was brighter than what the website photo indicated. I promptly returned it.
2.0,3x is like size 10
2.0,This thing arrived today and has threads coming out of it and has an aweful smell.  I'll deal with it because I need something like this.  The item itself is super cute and I love the concept because my daughter has really big hair.
2.0,"They are made well but I cannot recommend these at all. These shoelaces will not stay tied unless I double knot them. I keep having to re-tighten the laces every 30 minutes, even if I've just been sitting. They are too thick and the material is too shiny and smooth to get a good grip. Do not buy."
2.0,"just the dress it's ok, the coat and belt not the thing."
2.0,it was too big not what i wanted
2.0,"Smells terrible when you open package, and lenses don't stay in goggles very well.....but, it is super cute!"
2.0,"The white part is just beautiful! But the yellow one awful! To cheap and clear,,"
2.0,No wonder back in the day women could hardly walk in those pencil skirts. This was too small. I ordered another pattern and had to order a large and I still had to put a belt on because it was almost too big. Be careful with getting the right size. It does not match the size that you would normally wear. Don't be surprised if you have to send back to exchange the size.
2.0,"My favorite jumpsuits so far is by Banana Republic and Ralph Lauren because of the flattering material. I bought this because of the price and the great reviews. Super cheap polyester material I felt like it's from the 70s. The sizing was smaller than usual. Based on reviews, I ordered the L(12-14) and I typically wear size 10. The large did fit."
2.0,Loops holding strap detached on first day. Buttery design cumbersome.
2.0,Liked the colors and style
2.0,Maybe it just doesn’t look good on me. But I hate it. It has absolutely no shape. Bought to take maternity pictures in but am definitely going to wear something else.
2.0,"Got this same dress in two sizes, both were too big, had huge arm holes, and just fit weird. Bummer, love the style and material."
2.0,"We ordered thr white pair first and they were amazing so we bought the navy pants. The navy pants came from a different manufacturer, were too small, and then shrunk in the wash. Awful!! We would buy the white pair again, but we will never buy the navy pants again."
2.0,States that it is 60&#34; long and it's not even close to that. Essentially I bought a plastic belt buckle and will supply my own nylon strap.
2.0,It wasn't the best quality. Probably wouldn't buy it again since it looks like it's falling apart after a month of use.
2.0,It broke after the third day I wore it.
2.0,"Very disappointed in this product. Definitely not a compression tank and although it is lightweight, it is too much in my opinion as it's see through and I'm uncomfortable wearing it alone and not the best quality."
2.0,I bought it THREE sizes larger and did not fit!....another present for my daughter!...unless you are thin....DO NOT BUT!
2.0,Been wearing this since I got it. Gave me a rash. Smells funny. Hard to fasten.
2.0,"I'm reluctant to blame it on the hat, because I do have a big whopper head. But some ball caps fit me well anyway while others do not. This one doesn't. It's too small, doesn't fit my head right, and doesn't look right on my head."
2.0,Tangles and tarnishes very easily
2.0,"This is very cheap, very thin material. You can see through it and it seems like it can rip easily. It would be good as a one wear dress. Polyester mess."
2.0,"I really like the style, amount of space the purse has and the ability to switch between a handbag/backpack. I ordered one and it had a faulty zipper. I returned it and ordered a replacement. The replacement had the stitching coming apart in many places so I had to return it as well."
2.0,"This sweater looks cute, but it's cheap material that stretched out after an hour of wearing it."
2.0,BAD SIZING. BOUGHT 2XL WAY TOO SMALL. LOOKS LIKE MAYBE A MEDIUM !
2.0,"If you like to tuck your shirts in it won't be a big deal, but if not it was way too long. Also the material is shiny and almost slippery, not what I expected. I gave the shirt away to a friend."
2.0,The sizing is off. I bought for my 5 year old (size 7) and she’s swimming in the top while the pants are too short. Would not recommend.
2.0,"Very cute and comfortable! However, it is lined only to mid-thigh and that is very visible through the white jumpsuit. It really should be lined past the knee at least. I returned it."
2.0,"This jacket arrived on time. The first thing I noticed was the text error from the sleeve. As you can see here, some of the letters are jumbled up compared to the display picture of this product which is a big NO. This jacket does not do good in the rain if you are wondering. It's a good lightweight jacket, fits perfectly, and I loved the color. I tried to like it but because of what I mentioned earlier, I just decided to give it away to my brother."
2.0,"They don’t stay on the legs ,  The material is cheap and they ride off the legs fast."
2.0,The neckline was a little weird. And it fits weird in the armpits.
2.0,I loved the line and shape of these pants but they were cheaply constructed and made of a cheap sweat pant like material.I had to return them.
2.0,So much smaller then we thought
2.0,"The earings are beautiful, however, not as depicted they are sooo small.  The style is not for a child but the size is."
2.0,"I ordered this a full size larger than I normally wear it fit tight i was hoping this would be baggy and more of a comfy around the house shirt, but the band at the bottom was tight and the shirt even though it was a larger size than i normally wear  is actually tight around the chest, it definitely isn't designed for a girl with a chest."
2.0,Pretty but very flimsy.
2.0,I received the anklets and they are nice but I didn't receive the toe ring. I thought it's also included in the packagr but it was not. No toe ring. Disappointed
2.0,The product easily breaks. I used them on my Crocs
2.0,Colors are not as vivid as pictured.
2.0,this is for like my 8 year old...that's how big they are.
2.0,"The shirt was stupid small. XL wasn't even close.  It was a shame, because I love the shirt.  Great look, great material.  I was looking forward to wearing it.  I think I would need a 3XL, but they don't make that size.  Too bad."
2.0,"I am very disappointed that this scarf/shawl wrap isn't wider, I thought it was more of a shawl, instead, it's more scarf-like.  I was looking for a shawl."
2.0,"Arms on this dress are very small, dress is also thin"
2.0,"The band is pretty, a little lighter in color than the picture shows, but the clasp is cheap. It doesn't snap shut it just sits together. So when trying to wear the fitbit it just falls right off. So disappointing."
2.0,Nice but it felt cheap!
2.0,"This jacket by itself is nice, but runs very small. No way the bust size is 46.5"" as advertised: my bust size is 44 and jacket was too far away from closing. It would be too small evel for size Large, maybe fit size Medium. For size XL should order size 4XL, but not 2XL. Was very disappointed and returned. At least return process on Amazon was easy, but still don't understand, why Amazon doesn't check proper sizing of merchandise  offered on it's website."
2.0,They come in five different sizes. The smallest one I can't even get in my ear because it's so small. The next two sizes up are a real chore to close. They are a good material but need to just be a little bit bigger.
2.0,Too big! And a little too thick for me.
2.0,Frayed edges … great color bad construction
2.0,Gem falls out easy
2.0,"Based on other reviews, I expected more from the material and feel of this shirt. It's just an average, thick cotton T-shirt. Nothing special."
2.0,Too small does not fit had to give to my ten year old granddaughter
2.0,I am 5'5'' and weigh 125 lbs.  34DD. I ordered a small.  It was skin tight.
2.0,"Bought 7 to 8 size and it fits like as if its for an adult rather than a child pants are very long and so are sleeves. Kept it bc nephew loved it, but disappointed."
2.0,Looks good on model but I didn’t like
2.0,Nice vision but a little too small all-around.  Lets too much light in around the edges.
2.0,"Advertised as no seams, but there are two. They don't stay in place as claimed. And they are shorter on the foot as compared to the picture. Sent them back."
2.0,"Poorly made, the letters fell off and doesn't fit."
2.0,"This shirt does not fit as advertised. It is too short, barely covering the tops of my pants. Yuck!  Hello, 2x people need all the help we can get. Otherwise, the color is beautiful and the shirt is soft and durable."
2.0,Nothing like pic.cute jeans. but they were jeggings not relaxed fit jeans like in the pic. holes were in all different locations and different sizes even the color was a darker blue denim. I will add pic later this week
2.0,"Cute necklace,  but it turns your neck green quickly. You probably could switch out the chain for a higher quality one."
2.0,Keeps Turn my finger green
2.0,Sadly it's a sloppy looking shirt. I will probably try to sew together the partially stitched front because it would bow out and you could see my boobs. I sadly can't return because I don't have the information to send back.
2.0,"I don't think that I'm gonna use it. The  seams on the sleeves are too big, uncomfortable and itchy..."
2.0,"These earrings are cute, but also large. The post on them is at the top of the earring, not the center. I was hoping to use these for a 2nd hole, but they won't work for that. They cover your entire ear lobe, and hang lower."
2.0,"It's made out of some weird material, almost like baskeball shorts.  I didn't expect that at all."
2.0,I ordered a 6 but was sent a 9. And now shipping says 2 to 3 weeks so no time to re-order. That’s a shame because it is a beautiful dress. We will be returning.
2.0,Very cute but the pants are so much bigger than the top like 2 sizes. I got a 3-6 month but pants measures more like 12 months.
2.0,Received 2 pack suppose be 3 or 4 pack
2.0,Its good quality but super short. He wont be able to wear very long.
2.0,Not slimming at all
2.0,"Is clearly made for more petite frames. I am not fat and the XL was too small. The crotch would slide halfway to my knees because I have long legs (i am 5’9). Also, these are not lined with anything, they show panty lines very clearly."
2.0,This is a very pretty band I wore it for about a week then it started to fall apart.
2.0,they don’t fit well over my glasses
2.0,"The picture is way cuter than the product you will receive. It’s very basic thermal knit. The color is much more pale pink that what’s pictured as well. I’m a small in everything, this shirt fits big, it’s wearable though.  I could basically buy an $8 thermal shirt from the dollar store and get a better product."
2.0,"I bought last year a different color, but the other is total different, I ordered the one on the picture, this pass August, 2 days have passed after one month, three 3 days ago I decided to use my other pocketbook  where I have a compartment for this one, I noticed that one of the lenses came off, I put it back, and again fell off, the frame is too thin, compared with the first one pair of sun glasses  I ordered from same seller in 2019, I compared the golden one the frame is kind of thick and firm, the blue one which has about 1 month 2 days I bought it, I have problem with same lenses, coming off always, I have a total of 6 pairs, different colors, different brands, but this one which is my favorite color, I cannot recommended.  I want to replace it, or give me money back. If I knew on time that the lenses was going to come off, I could send it on time, unfortunately came off 3 days ago.  I cannot give a better feed back until the seller honor this item, more than $25 I paid,  I can choose another brand.  Hence, I deserve to have a new pair and send me the prepaid label immediately.  Thanks"
2.0,Kinda wide sits on my ears too heavy
2.0,"After one wash 2/3 buttons came off the sweater. I love it, other wise… great fit and style just not the best quality."
2.0,"I did not see in the description that the shirt had metal in the application on front. I was going to return but since it is not amazon  prime , it would cost more than it is worth. My mistake."
2.0,"It's cute, not particularly warm or useful in cold weather since it's so small. There is no room for zipping over a ""Western"" chest as it is so tiny on top."
2.0,The image is so blurry and grainy. Even worse the hood has half the image on it and it's cut off?? The image is not even straight. Also I got an XL but it's fits like a small. I'm usually medium and was hoping it would be big and roomy. But it's tight.b
2.0,"they were nice but I didn't like them for me (too big for my face),when I tried them on I said &#34;oh no not for me&#34;, im going to give them to my daughter's bff."
2.0,Love the color! But wasnt as thick as it looked and it was to small
2.0,Bad quality. Muy rebajado y corto de tiro
2.0,"Not a good product, its cheap."
2.0,Overall support is good and fit is as expected. The zipper is a major flaw for my body and rubbed my skin raw in about 40 minutes of wear in very low impact setting. Going to have to send back as I literally had to tape the zipper to protect my skin
2.0,"Fits great, nice soft material, good color BUT there’s a small hole in it like it was cut with a small knife"
2.0,"It doesn’t fit right and if your intentions are to use it as a workout sport bra is not supportive. I’ve order other sports bra from this brand and they are pretty good. Was very disappointed on this one, I’m 34C 5” 120 fit. I am extremely active (gym) this bra will not help for this purpose."
2.0,This was for my 6 year old and it was to tight. She refused to wear it
2.0,I’m 5’2” 130 lbs and ordered a medium. It was very tight and unforgiving. The material was stiff and cheap.
2.0,It's a pretty but mine smell.  It has deordant stain on it. Obviously someone wore it.
2.0,The nosepieces on these glasses came bent. I couldn't fix them back to the normal position so they sit crooked on my face.
2.0,[[VIDEOID:60a123367f38d25c87d2ff7bf70c9f2a]] I don’t like how it’s says toddlers but they are too big for my daughters feet she is 2 and usually can fit a toddler size 5
2.0,"the sizing is way off,,it is at least 2 sizes too large"
2.0,Very cute design but too large.
2.0,mmm...nothing to write home about...
2.0,I like them and they fit well but they arrived with a hole where the stitching came apart on the leg so I have to fix them before I can wear them out of the house.  So that's disappointing.
2.0,These are okay. Not very shinny
2.0,Picture is deceiving. Much smaller than they appear in the photo. Cute design but too small for my taste.
2.0,"These look great on, but they're not very well made. Still, for the price, they're fun while they last. They are too big for me, not the lenses (which are huge, but I like that), I'm referring to the fit in general. I tried to gently bend them and the lens popped out. I was able to put it back in without much effort, but they still slide down my nose. Kind of distracting when I'm walking across a parking lot with bags in my hands and can't push them back up!"
2.0,Cheaply made. I had to reinforce with small hinges.  Flimsy Cardboard construction.
2.0,This broke on my daughter 2 days after she got it.  It was a dissapointment she liked the mermaid and what it said but the hook that clips the two ends together broke
2.0,Great price but the sunglasses look cheap
2.0,I’m 5’2 1/2 and these fit me like high waters. The material is a bit thin and cheap (you could get a better pair on fashion nova for $13). Won’t buy again.
2.0,"They are warm, but I don't care how tall the models are, these are too short for taller people.  I am a long-legged 5'7&#34; and well within my BMI range. These leggings are 3.5&#34; above the center of my inside ankle bone.  The stretched length is irrelevant because they will relax to their normal state.  They are OK for wearing with mid-rise and taller boots and boot socks, but short boots or ankle socks leave a chilly gap.  Therefore, they are not useful for hanging around the house in normal socks and slippers.  They need tall socks over them - not a charming look.  Looking for short friends to give them to."
2.0,"It was not what I was expecting. It's not a shirt I would wear out. I wear it in the house with leggings. It was not cute at all, the size fit fine"
2.0,I had bought a colored and a black pair. The colored had a hole in the leg and bigger than the black. The black pair fit perfect. I decided to order two more of the black and the size difference was 3 inches in the waist between the two. Gave my grand daughter the small pair. They are very inconsistent sizes so if you don’t mind the hit and miss ordering these are for you!
2.0,"This is made of stretchy fabric that probably isn't normally used for regular clothing -- maybe costumes or dancewear. It was folded and incredibly wrinkled when I took it out of the packaging, and when I tried to iron it on the lowest setting, the material instantly started melting, and I was left with a huge mark on the dress and gummy residue on the iron. I was so crushed, because it fits well and looks great."
2.0,Grey on the shirt is lighter and the the lips have a bright orange the sleeves look different as well. If your someone who has attention to details I wouldn’t recommend. Good material though and cute even though it does look slightly different.
2.0,"Very cute, however the bottoms snagged first wash. The bottoms fit True to size but the top was a little small."
2.0,I really was excited to wear this the weather broke I put it on fits perfect but totally see through you can see everything as if I don't have anything on... I recommend black not pink unless that's the look you going for
2.0,"I like the pattern and colors.  Unfortunately, I have to return the dress."
2.0,"I wanted so much to like this pendant, as I do read reviews before purchasing on Amazon. The image looks very elegant AND made of a more heavy metal. When it arrived, it was very cheap-looking and very lightweight, giving it a &#34;child-like&#34; plastic look as apposed to a pendant designed for a woman. Would not recommend for a woman, but maybe a piece of costume jewelry for a child."
2.0,"Very cute, until you wash it.  It shrinks and gets deformed.  I washed it on ultra delicate cycle and air dried it but now it's ruined."
2.0,"I don't write reviews often, but this item is, sadly, so poorly made I felt obligated to do so.  It has an.....odd fit.  arms are tight. waist is a big....just poor.  Loved the snap-button front closure, until the snaps, all 3, fell off the first day.  they were sewn on so poorly that they just hung by threads after day 1.  Lining ripped after 5 wears (just wearing it to work and home).  warm and pretty fabric, awful construction.  :("
2.0,I ordered a size up xl and my daughter who wears a small can fit it
2.0,Too tight really not liking the jumpsuit at all
2.0,"Ring was as expected; jewels fell out over a month and tarnished, but never made my finger green"
2.0,It's a beautiful shirt just to small in the she eve area
2.0,This dress was pretty big and not as appealing in person. The colors were nice but the material was cheap feeling and it did not look good on. Returned it.
2.0,Color was very pretty. Just too baggy around the bottom ... Not flattering
2.0,"Quality is not that great.  The decorative buttons are not sewn on well and one fell off the first time I tried to wear them.  Now they set on the sewing machine waiting for repair.  Did not send them back as I should, I just dint feel like using my time that way.  My own fault for not getting a refund."
2.0,it was beautiful. but way too small. gave it to my daughterinlaw. I bought XL fit like medium
2.0,"the chain look is deceiving, once you have it in your hands it is toooooooo thin."
2.0,"No panty lines but runs big. Size chart is inaccurate, I'm a size 12 and got the L and it's too big, wish I got the M."
2.0,had to return them as they were much smaller that the other 41 FiveFinger pair i have.
2.0,"I spent a long time reading reviews and seeing what size to buy, and it was still too small. I’m also 5’10, and it would have been too short no matter how loose or tight it might have been. Probably great for shorter, skinnier bodies!"
2.0,"I ordered these because I wanted the snap on the scarfs, I received 4 with snaps and 4 without.  I don’t know why they were not all with a snap. See photo."
2.0,The color is not at all how it looked online. I ordered coral but got a really bight bright orange. I was very disappointed.
2.0,The color was different along with the quality.  IT arrived in 2 pieces and I have yet to even attempt to try to put it together.
2.0,"It looked adorable, I loved how it looked, but it's not the best quality bellybutton ring I've had - the bottom part actually snapped off in the shower (not like I was bungee jumping or doing anything wild) after wearing it on and off for a few weeks.  I could've glued it back together but  I try not to mix too many chemicals and piercings.  It's super super cute and didn't irritate my piercing, but handle with care!"
2.0,"I bought these for someone who has trouble with her hands.<br />Both the gold and silver. (8 of each)<br />Half of them are useless, because they have no mates for the magnet.<br />What a bummer"
2.0,he already lost his glasses as they sllipped off the chain. This was not what I had thought it would be.
2.0,Super cute tank can dress up or down. But it runs VERY small. I typically wear large (12/14) which is what I ordered. Fits like a small. Could barely get over my head. Kinda disappointed that I have to return.  I would say size up 2 sizes for true fit
2.0,They are beautiful and the right size I wanted. But I put them in right when I opened them and today a day later my ear was swollen and infected. I took them out and my ears are still very sore. I don’t usually react to earrings like this especially good metal. I don’t understand why they made my ears hurt so bad. I wear silver earrings everyday and I’ve worn gold before and even nickel earrings and never had this problem.
2.0,"I ordered this watch to replace one that I have had for years. The band on my old watch finally broke and since the band is one piece with the watch, I could not wear it any longer.  I received this watch today and, to my disappointment, my wife now has a new watch. I could not get the band around my wrist past the very first hole in the band.  Since it only cost $10.00, I would rather give it to her to wear in the pool than to go to the hassle of sending it back.  Beware, it looks more like a child's watch than one for an adult."
2.0,"on first wearing these socks, the tops come up to where they should but one trip through the dryer and the shrinkage was considerable. the foot part did stretch out again but the top is still short."
2.0,"Runs small. Cute design, not good material"
2.0,"They're good for a week or two of consistent everyday use, but then they break easily- almost unprovoked.."
2.0,"While it does look nice, when I see plush; I think ""thick and heavy.""<br /><br />This is neither.<br /><br />I ordered an XL, this fits more like a large.<br /><br />Not too impressed with this."
2.0,These look like a toy bracelet for a child.
2.0,shirt did not fit well
2.0,Cool idea but chain broke within 24 hours.
2.0,"Really wasn't impressed with this watch, received as a gift it was very cheap looking. I normally do not write these type of reviews but I have to admit, just is not for me."
2.0,"I loved it at first, but it started to peel at the corners after 4 months. Then the pockets peeled away around 6 months. Had to order a different case. No I didn't buy this one again."
2.0,"Been wearing them about 2 days per week for the past 6 months about 7-8h a day. It started to show signs of tear about 2 months in, and now they are completely unusable. Definitely not the best quality, although sucks feel great on my legs."
2.0,The material is nice and so is the fit BUT why is it completely open into the inside?!?!  I wrote them and asked why and they’re response was...Yes it open. Don’t worry about it. LOL!!! You can wear a tank under it but it shows since the shirt is hi-lo and takes away from the look. I’m disappointed.
2.0,"Great fit for folks with thick feet. The side walls of the shoes are too high creating a problem for long runs as it bruises the side of the ankle and afyer a few runs, if you ignore the pain while jogging it becomes so bruised that you cant run. Disapppinting overall. Especially given the hype around this brand. Never happend with competing brands."
2.0,"If the item description for this shirt had said ""sheer"" or ""thin"" or something of the sort, then it would have been okay, but it did not say that. So, when the shirt arrived, and I felt and saw the shirt, it wasn't a match for what I wanted.  I pride myself on buying inexpensive items which look and feel expensive, and although the cut of this shirt is super cute, for me, the fabric and buttons choice was off the mark.  Returning."
2.0,Sleeve and waist elastic is very tight. Material is thin. Fit is not very flattering.
2.0,Poor fit. Size 2X was more like a Large
2.0,Loved the colors but it was to big for my daughter
2.0,"Wheny son saw the masks, he was so excited! Then he told me that the nose pieces were not in the right place. They were about 1 1/2 inches off....no where near the middle. When we tried to move the nose piece, it moved a little, but not enough. I will have to open the stitching and move the nose piece and restitch it. Another mask had a hole in the stitching, so I have to restitch that one as well. I was able to move one masks nose piece without issue. Not happy. If I wanted to do this much work, I would have made my own, honestly."
2.0,These glasses don't work very well at magnifying they more make everything blurry
2.0,"Bought these for my granddaughter and she wore them once.  The size is a bit small.  No padding in the back of the heel and the shoes rubbed blisters on her heels.  Luckily, she was at summer camp and changed into her flip-flops.  Promptly went into the Goodwill bag."
2.0,Tops will not stay on
2.0,Los botones están flojos y hacen mucho ruido al caminar o al moverse
2.0,"This dress was poorly made and the material was extremely cheap. I paid $49.99 + $19.99 for shipping and handling + $5.44 in taxes - $4.00 promotion $71.44 total. To return it I paid $12.73. I was refunded $49.78 I ended up wasting $34.39 on a product I 1. Did not like at all as it’s not like the picture 2. Did not wear at all, because I didn’t even bother trying it on. 3. Do not own.<br /><br />I would say yourself the trouble and don’t order this."
2.0,Rough on face
2.0,"I give it 2 stars for the length of it (8 inches), most are a little smaller.  This is suppose to be leather but it is very cheap leather, the strap is NOT leather at all but some cheap material.  When I opened it up the latch on the strap was broken making it unusable.  I took it to a shoe repair shop that also fixes handbags and paid another $10.00 for this wallet to get it repaired.  I will be replacing it with something else when I find what I am looking for.  The Sak has gone down in quality in the last few years but the prices have not dropped.  Give us quality products PLEASE!!!!"
2.0,"The stone is nice. but the cord is cheap, thin and ichy. Does not match the advertised images. Would not recommend. Not impressed"
2.0,Will not stay on ear if you do not have a full outer ridge on ear...if you ear looks like picture it will more then likely  stay on...the earring cuff itself is very pretty and we'll made
2.0,"I didn't like neither the fabric or the design. It doesn't fit well, unless  you are up to size 4."
2.0,It won't stay on my glasses. The clip is not strong enough so they just fall off. Useless.
2.0,this is more like a shirt than a dress not very flattering
2.0,It's starting to tarnish... I hope cleaning it with sterling silver cleaner will bring it back to life... Its kinda big too....
2.0,"Love the design idea, but it is so difficult to see!  Must be tipped a certain way in lighting to see the images.  Odd."
2.0,"I got this for my daughter who is 5'5 and it's huge on her, we will have to alter the dress so it fits her better. We ordered large but it fits like a 3x would."
2.0,"I loved the idea of having a few granny dresses to be cool in while working around the yard and discounted the previous reviews regarding quality. I shouldnt have. 1 wear and seams have split on 2 dresses. might try to resew the seams, but the way it pulls isnt about the stiching, but the flimsy nature of the fabric"
2.0,"I ordered a L based on the size chart for the half sleeve blouse, which corresponded to my bust size.  The blouse fit me in the bust and shoulders, but the blouse was a short sleeved blouse rather than half sleeved.  The sleeve length wasn't a deal breaker, but not what I was expecting.  However, the blouse was not something I felt would pair well with leggings or skinny jeans as the blouse was too small from the bust down.  I think it would be helpful if the company listed the waist measurements of the blouse in their size chart.  I'm returning the blouse, which is a shame because I really like the style and the colors are nice."
2.0,Broke first day she wore it.
2.0,The fit was probably my  fault.  But the quality is poor... it is paper thin... you can see right through it.<br />I will have to buy a tux shirt somewhere else before the wedding.
2.0,It’s hard to find that soft jersey cotton and it be a Heathen shirt.
2.0,"I received these circular barbells far earlier than the projected shipping date, which is wonderful! However, these look MUCH, MUCH better in the picture on this listing. In the picture, the jewels appear to be at least semi-set in the stainless steel balls. In person, the jewels look to be glued directly on top of the balls, so they stick out in a really unflattering way. Also, the jewels are not as clear and diamond-like as they appear in the picture. I suppose that these will serve their purpose for the price, but I am really hoping that people do not look TOO close as my jewelry while I wait to replace them. My personal opinion would be to save up for some higher quality jewelry, especially if you want diamond-like jewels/gems/stones."
2.0,"To many chemicals. Washed them over 10 times, still can’t wear them."
2.0,"Put my cross on it and took it off and on for bed and showers. Within a couple times of wearing this it broke, I ordered another one."
2.0,"Arms too tight and pants too large and long. Armor looks pretty decent for leather, but the base of the costume needs to be altered."
2.0,"The bottom section fits well (normally a 5-6) but unless you have very slim arms the sleeves are Way to skinny, and only stretch a bit. even for lace its very easy to tear. if your a fully slim build then this will probably fit quite nice and look good."
2.0,Looks just like the photo but the fabric is very uncomfortable and the fit of the dress is boxy and unflattering.
2.0,I also received finger gloves instead of mittens. I ended up giving them to my mom because they were too tight and not what I wanted. They worked for her. Nice but disappointed.
2.0,to small on inside.  very bulky on outside. could never carry it in front pocket<br /><br />no place to carry cash except for a flimsy band on one side.<br /><br />if you fill up every slot with 1 credit card it barely closes and it feels like the clasp will not hold up over time.
2.0,Although the product description said light weight the material is extremely thin. I bought the black /gray color but it close to being see through. I am disappointed. I will keep the item but I will need to wear something underneath as well - like a tank to or tee shirt.
2.0,I needed this vest to hold tools in for a wedding I was decorating for.  The shoulder straps do not adjust in length and they kept falling off of my shoulders.  Very frustrating when you are up against the clock and need to be as hassle free as possible.
2.0,This is a very boxy cut and is not at all flattering. Texture was shiny and didn’t hang like t-shirt material
2.0,Ugh.... The colors are awful in person. The look like store uniforms. And the fabric feels cheap. I returned these.
2.0,"Loved the look, just too small and a little see through"
2.0,"Not very happy. Bought for my husband for his birthday July 2017. Within 2 weeks belt tore at the 4th hole, exposing the layers which are glued together and not leather. Not a solid piece."
2.0,Super cheap in person. Looks much better on the model. Boxy fit. Returned mine.
2.0,Loved it until after washing it a few times. The material got really itchy.
2.0,Runs small and looks like a lab coat. Is good for a walk in very lite rain or drizzle.
2.0,"I'm a small to average sized woman, pretty similar to the one pictured, actually.  The arm holes for this were way too big so it didn't lay right at all. I could've tied knots in them to make them work, but I sent it back."
2.0,"i liked the dress itself, but i ordered the large and it was really big (more like xl) so i ordered the medium and it was too small (more like an xs) so i guess there is no happy medium???? sad really. the fabric is ok, the style good, just sizing issues. i will be having to give them away because it will be more to send back, then it cost to get them. disappointed."
2.0,Not compression...at all.
2.0,"Hat was disappointment. Sagged, refused to hold shape, deformed easily."
2.0,"I ordered 3 pairs of these in different colors. All 3 were labeled the same but this pair, in particular was solidly one full size too small. Either the person doing the labeling needs to pay closer attention to to what they're doing, or the person doing the sewing needs to pay better attention to elastic length. Silly rabbit."
2.0,These aren’t the quality they used to be. Washed them once and they are coming apart at the seems. I can’t find any other leggings with pockets that fit so well. I’ll put extra sticking in with my sewing machine.
2.0,Its really big. If you use size M you should get size xs.
2.0,"The knit part was nice, but the stitching on the little leather DG tag was way off, it made it look cheap and not something I’d wear or give as s gift. The puff ball was also a little off. I returned it."
2.0,"Looks good before it gets wet.  Then it sags and gets floppy when wet.  It's not a good look, really it's the opposite of sexy.  I love the length but I'm thinking neoprene shorts would be a better option. I'm trying to decide if sewing the legs skinner would help, it really is made of the wrong material for it to work well (it's normal plain swimsuit material)."
2.0,"These are cute, but TOO BIG for preschool heads."
2.0,The material was very flimsy and it was poorly made.
2.0,Sheer dress! Very thin and see through. The color of the decor on the bottom is highlighter orange.
2.0,"I would be pleased otherwise, but if I have to repair it before I can wear it I cannot recommend this."
2.0,it was really pretty but stone fell out 2 days after i got it. Very dissappointed.
2.0,It fits ....its ok
2.0,I recently received these. try them all on and wore one of them today. they are comfortable. a little small but not uncomfortable. The only issue i notice was on the back at the bottom. the stitching looks like is coming apart and i only wore these once. while wearing one most of the day today. it does not look good on the durability for these. Not sure if should return them or not.
2.0,"too small of fit,  would like to return."
2.0,Products did not adhere as projected....I never even trusted them to stay on long enough to wear them once...got rid of them
2.0,Material is soft but very thin. Underwear line is super visible and any cellulite shows as well
2.0,"Does the seller think that I’ll keep the item if it’s different than the picture of the product.<br />I’m giving it 2 stars only because of the softness and the good size. But the color is totally different than what I ordered. It’s very thin shirt like material. The beige is very light like it’s washed beige, it has nothing to do with the picture of the product.<br />Even The cheetah design on the elbow appears beige in the pic and what I received was a pink cheetah, the color is not even slightly related to the rest of the shirt and looks horrible and so mismatched.<br />I’m so disappointed. I really liked the picture and was hoping I’d receive the same.<br />I wear small and that’s what I ordered. Size is good. Slightly loose but good."
2.0,It's a little small for my pics fortunately I ordered the other one a Tandy. I guess I will keep this one as a backup
2.0,The ring is actually very beautiful. The color is softer than in the picture though. I was disappointed with the fact that on the second day of having it....the two stones on the left fell out because they were loose. I cried a little because I fell in love with the aesthetic and I thought I was going to have it for a long time.
2.0,"I ordered this shirt, as seen. The shirt I ordered was a completely different color. The shirt was also too big."
2.0,The dress is extremely large and has no shale whatsoever. I put it kn and looked like a bag. The fabric is not nice too. It’s pure lycra and super warm.
2.0,This is super small
2.0,Normally a solid size small so that's what was ordered. Boobs are 34B so not huge. The straps were super loose and it was a tad large around in the top but way too small for the boobs. The bottoms fit great but were a little wide in the crotch so it probably would have been a little uncomfortable walking around. Too bad because it is a super cute style.
2.0,"Earrings and stones are very small, perfect for a child. Photos were misleading and for $60.00 I'd like them visible."
2.0,"I feel like these sit way too low on the hips and are way too long in the legs...just a weird fit overall. Also, the “light pink lettering” on the dark grey pants is just white. Pretty disappointing :("
2.0,I fully expect these to fall apart (become unglued) with regular use.  They do not look very elegant or expensive in person.
2.0,You get what you pay for. I took it out of the package and the round decorative pendant fell to the floor. Looks very cheap and the chain is too thick which makes it cheap looking.
2.0,The dress looks cute but then I put it on. The slit in the skirt is very revealing. I purchased this for work however will not be able to wear it in that setting.
2.0,I am normally a small but i like my hoodies to be baggy so i ordered a large . i could barely get my arms in in and no way could i get it over my head . very very disappointed
2.0,Will be returning...does not look like picture...much cheaper looking.
2.0,It was ok. Did not last long.
2.0,"I've had the winder for a few months now. At first I couldn't hear it at all. Unfortunately now I hear a faint grinding sound, some of the time, when it's on."
2.0,I will need a smaller size nice material tho
2.0,Bought for my 5month old baby? It’s color changed within 5weeks. It tarnished within 5wks
2.0,Fits great however a few of the gems fell off the bracelet in the bag before I ever opened it.
2.0,Poor quality.  Will get little use out of.  Very thin with little to no elasticity.
2.0,Would not stay on her face. She was very disappointed. Sad and wouldn't buy again as I don't want to disappoint my granddaughter ever again.
2.0,"I put them in my monroe and none of the balls would stay on. Even after attempting to fully screw them on, they were still loose."
2.0,One shoe was a completely different size than the other. Never got to wear them.
2.0,This is a very weird and tight fitting shirt. It's very soft but it's almost like it has way to much spandex in it as it sucks to my skin. The sleeves are also very long
2.0,"The size L actually feels like a medium to me, as I like a little breathing room for comfort, both top and bottom were too tight fitting. I don't  like the fabric at all, it doesn't feel good against my skin."
2.0,I like the appearance of the glasses. I just think they're cheap. They're flimsy & cracked twice😒
2.0,"I know you can't tell by looking on line, but it's too big and the chain won't last long. You get what you pay for."
2.0,I  DONT REMEMBER ORDERING THIS RING AND GETTING IT
2.0,"WAY TOO SMALL. The large MAY fit an anorexic teenage girl. 2XL?? Maybe a mens L. Maybe.<br />The fabric is awesome, plush and cuddly. Because I. An sew, I can rip the side seams apart and insert fabric, and replace the elastic in the waist.<br />Since I just got these for my husband and me to hang around the house, I don't care what they look like.<br />ALWAYS READ REVIEWS BEFORE BUYING ANYTHING.<br />P.S. These are not American made."
2.0,Sizing is way off! My son wears a toddler 11 and they are HUGE. I'm holding on to them until he grows into them. Can't comment on how they wear.
2.0,"I'm not sure why nobody mentioned it before, but the top is itchy. I own many merino wool sweaters, dresses, and base layers, and never had this problem. Otherwise, the pajamas do look good (I did size up per other reviews, I'm usually Sand got M), but the scratchiness makes them unwearable. Sad because I really wanted a merino wool pajama, this one is getting returned. My search continues..."
2.0,"I got these because of the cut and pattern. I'm short, long legged, and curvy. I ADORE this pattern and it's so beautiful, but I have 27 inch thighs and after wearing these for less than a whole day the thighs are pilling and I already know this fabric isn't lasting long. If your thighs touch then these aren't for you. I wish it was made out of a better fabric because I would get soooo many. They're only ""fitted"" at the waist on me (little bit of room at the front, but not slipping and sliding) so they aren't just too small or anything."
2.0,"I LOVED this bag, but I guess you get what you pay for. Got this in end of may. It is now beginning of august and it's falling apart. I'm kinda disappointed bc I thought it was holding up really well for a $40 bag. Then I noticed the handle. It took a year of heavy everyday use for my coach bags to start wearing on the handles. Figured I'd give this one a try bc it had a well made expensive look for a lot less $$. But this is also a Kenneth Cole reaction which is the cheaper production line for them so I suppose I shouldn't of expected much. Still disappointing it barely last 2 months worth of use before wearing down."
2.0,"I normally wear a large because I'm 5'10 and 18 0lbs soaking wet , these shorts were skin tight on me as a large. I sat down once and then ripped down the middle. This was the first time I wore them after a wash. I noticed the material is basically see through as well. Bummer."
2.0,"I love the Idea of this ring. I was expecting it to be a bit bigger. it is very small around, and very tiny in size. barely fits my pinky."
2.0,"Ordered a large, still looks large didn't wear it."
2.0,This looked cute online.  But when I got it the football was very weird looking.  Too goofy to wear.
2.0,"I did give thouse rings a try ....to be honest, they do look poor. They do not turn black in time, but  the design is kinda bad. Defenetly not for adults, more for children to play with ."
2.0,"Why can't these Chinese companies figure out how to get the second hand to work. The watch overall is okay but the hour ,minute and second hands do not work properly."
2.0,It was cheap made and had hanging strings all over it.
2.0,"I love the color of the scarf, and the softness. But when I washed it it did something funny to the fabric and it just doesn't sit or feel the same."
2.0,"Very disappointed, wanted snug fit for use under my helmet when skating. Definitely too big for womens and kids. Probably ok for men."
2.0,Fits big. Color is way off from advertised photo. The pink flowers are almost fluorescent. Not flattering
2.0,"DON’T BUY THIS SWIMSUIT.<br />I just received this swimsuit that I purchased through third part seller.  That was my first mistake.  Tried to cancel order same day but couldn’t because it was already being shipped fro China.  Took many weeks to get here.<br />When I opened looked cheap and had no hygiene pad in bottom part of suit.<br />The fit was ridiculous. The top was made for a little girl.  If u buy this size up by 2 or 3 sizes especially if u have normal size breasts.<br />Bottom looks ok.  But overall not impressed with the product.<br />Now trying to return it and I have to pay for return because it wasn’t prime.  That was not clear in description of this bathing suit.<br />Amazon customer rep assured me that as a prime customer, they would reimburse for cost of sending back item.  One time only deal.<br />So be careful when u purchase third party items. Very difficult returning products to them.<br />Nevertheless, I strongly recommend not purchasing this product."
2.0,The patch in the front (upper middle) looks very weird if you taking a close look.
2.0,Did not fit my glasses well.  I have plastic frames & clip would not go over the thickness of the frame.  May work better with wire or thin frames.  Could not use.  Also I think they need to be quite large to cover all of glasses as fit is not an easy match.
2.0,The shoulders on this dress kind of puff up in an unexpected way. The dress is cute but I didn't like the fit in the shoulders and the embroidery is soooo itchy on the legs.
2.0,"It's a beautiful ring, as long as u don't bump it against anything. The bar is matted and any little scratch comes through shining. Easily bends too. It didn't survive a night out w the girls.<br /><br />If you are a very carful and delicate person, this ring might last longer for you. Me, I enjoyed it for a week :/"
2.0,Neck stretched out right away.
2.0,The color is good but they were kids sizes.
2.0,"I really like this brand, I have one other pair that I love so i was really disappointed when these came in with a Frayed pocket seem and the tag not attached. Other then that the leggings seem great, just poor shopping and handling."
2.0,These are cute and exactly what I was looking for IF they didn’t come unscrewed so easily!! I’ve lost 2 balls within 3 days!!
2.0,Smells like oil or chemicals. Not great quality.
2.0,I have ordered 5 different pair of jeanie pants.  All r basically the same size. I like the material but not the sizing chart
2.0,I thought this was a stainless steel but it wasn’t. It started changing color after just two weeks even when I wasn’t taking shower with it.
2.0,"Beautiful, but clasp broke within minutes of wear."
2.0,They look like cheap costume jewelry. They're a cross between tarnished and faded in some areas.
2.0,"These look good in pictures, but they are way too big and too heavy for my ears. Even trying them for a min, my ears started to hurt. I loved the design, wish they were smaller and lighter."
2.0,"Sitting in the tree stand, +20 degrees about 15mph winds, couldn’t feel my fingers.. plus they were bulkier than I pictured"
2.0,too small do not look like the picture.
2.0,Poor quality and zipper is on the side traditionally placed in womens attire. Way small and customer service is abhorent.
2.0,"Although it did save me in a pinch, these pants were wayyy too small. The fabric feels more like foam, rips easily and doesn't breath. I normally wear size 34 and while I was able to wear them, there really wasn't much give or room for my crotch and thighs. They ended up ripping when I rode my bike with them on."
2.0,"It appears to be cheaply made and the change pocket was too small, among other things."
2.0,"Disappointed in the &#34;slimming&#34; feature. If you're overweight hoping this will smooth and flatten, it won't. While I did feel well-supported in it, it felt little more than underpants that were too small. The only thing that did get flattened were my man parts."
2.0,"If you only want this as a keychain, you are in good shape... but I ordered 2 versions of this- one in the pearl shade and this one with multiple colors... both claimed they would arrive with 30in chains- and one chain is less than half the size of the other. The pendant is lovely, but I wish the chain on this colored pendant is the correct length."
2.0,So the first pair I wore fit perfectly and they are honestly my favorite things. The second pair I tried on literally ripped down the middle. I am highly sad and disappointed.
2.0,Strong chemical smell.
2.0,Didn't fit as well as I hoped for. Our 5 month old wiggles a lot and easily escaped this. The material is nice for eczema kids though!
2.0,Unfortunately the kaftan is fairly cheaply made and one size would really fit from a size 16-20 best. I wear a 12-14 and two people my size could jump on in.
2.0,Stiffer cotton. Not very flowy material. Doesn't drape/hang well.
2.0,Color is different as shown
2.0,It's so nice that you get a large variety of necklaces but have to say that they are not the best quality. Right of the bed I did break the lock on one of them just trying to put it on. The one that is elastic will loose its shape and size over time. Over all I think it was worse the price.
2.0,I purchased these to workout in and the Larges fit like tight mediums. After washing they shrunk. I plan on ordering again but getting a XXL or 3XL to see if maybe they fit better. Quality of shirt is awesome though and it’s very breathable but actual fitment and length I’m not pleased with at all.
2.0,I measured my calf muscles and ordered these.  They are so tight!  Fit is smaller than measurements on line...also they have a smell like petrolium...makes me kind of afraid of putting them on my skin.  Washed them 6 times trying to get the smell out...still there...they look cool for support socks but I am not happy with them.
2.0,The bottom rips easily
2.0,It was cute but the clasp broke within 2 weeks.
2.0,These beads were a disappointment. They broke apart the minute I tried them on. Have to restring them now!
2.0,"I love the design of this shirt but wish it was put on a higher quality tee. The fabric is not soft and is not even a tiny bit stretchy. This wouldn’t be a huge problem except for the fact that it (at least the one I got, I know sometimes clothing can get wonky item to same item) runs CRAZY small. If you still want to give it a try after this review, I at least recommend sizing up more than a whole size."
2.0,Shirt was nice but extremely big. I ordered a size small (normally almost a medium) but this fit like an extra large.
2.0,"I ordered this product for postpartum underwear because I was having my first planned c-section. I am usually a medium so I ordered a large based on the reviews, but they were very tight. I kept them because I figured I could wear them after a few weeks and I ordered a second set of XL. Even those were tight, but not uncomfortable....until I had the c-section. The top of the underwear landed halfway between my incision and my belly button which is right where some of the inner layers were stitched up. It added a great deal of discomfort to what I was already feeling. I haven't been wearing these post surgery and they are not something I would wear as part of my normal, everyday outfits, so I feel like I just wasted my money. I would recommend looking for something else if you are buying for the purpose of post-c-section underwear."
2.0,"I saw the dress on someone and liked it, but when I ordered it the dress was just okay! it came without a belt so I would have had to buy one. Will probable return!"
2.0,Watch is HUGE
2.0,Terrible product. It broke after the first use. The choker looked awkward. Just kept the charm for decoration.
2.0,"It is cute. However, it is super difficult to put on and the back gets twisted. Taking it off takes an army. Will not hold up your boobs. So don't buy if you have bigger then a B cup"
2.0,"Flimsy, flat, small. Don't buy unless it's for your 6 year old."
2.0,Forced to return product as I can’t walk without tripping due to excessive length & hemming is not a desirable option
2.0,"Quality of this dress is horrible, very cheaply made and so thin it's see through.  I had on a black bra with the dress and even it was seen through this material. it also runs small so order a size larger because of the waistline running so small and the arm diameter."
2.0,"Look good and fit fine but are too dark, Is there anything I can do to lighten the up?"
2.0,Unclips easy. Beware during a night out. I spent most of my night either looking for my brand new belt or checking to make sure it was still on.
2.0,"I'm a size 16, 42D so ordered 2 suits in XXXL. Bottoms fit great. Top cups were too big. They were closer to DD size. I had a double mastectomy last year and went from natural DD to D reconstructed implants. This was my first new bathing suit since and it was a disappointment. I'll keep trying & will eventually find what works! :-)"
2.0,Bought this watch to replace an earlier one and it has already stopped working after only a short period of time.  Disappointing
2.0,Fits rather small. I am a woman with a regular-sized head and it's too snug for me.
2.0,Pretty but constantly catching and pulling my hair. If you have long hair be warned.
2.0,Too small to be a 2X.  Could not button the front.
2.0,CHEAP LOOKING IN THE BACK
2.0,Thin and the clasps on the neck strap are very cheap. Two of the clasps caved in when I tried to snap them together. So now I can't clasp them together which makes it useless! Very frustrating!
2.0,"I gave 3 stars giving it the benefit of the doubt if they fit might look better, but another major concern for the pair received is the sheerness.  So, wear a pair of leggings underneath to fit tighter, and resolve the see through effect, right.  Leggings, for one could not make-up for the bagginess in the crotch, being beyond acceptable (and I do not prefer that extra tight, leave nothing to the imagination), but not so much you can smuggle products there, either.  Wearing leggings under your pants out of need is like wearing a bra in a strapless dress/top.  It's not comfortable, is constantly tugging, adjusting, whatever, and sucks.<br />I rely on reviews to consider sizing based on weight, height, and the size ordered in comparison to my measurements.  For those out there with the same dilemma of petite sized proportions on a non- petite sized height, meaning too tall to wear petite, you understand.  I am 5'7"" 119 lbs. (age gains weight, but where???).  Size 3 or 5 junior pants can tell just by looking, BUT do not assume Small is the fit by other reviews.<br />Long, slender legs did my butt no justice in the Small for the back zippered pants.  (I do NOT have a flat butt, by no means).  Hope this helps"
2.0,"Wayyyy too light and flimsy. It’s all nylon barely any wool. I want a baselayer vest made from wool and this is not what I got. Had just some wool in arm pits and behind the next. No hip/hand pockets. Just the one chest pocket. Plus way too expensive for what it is. Bad smartwool, bad. I have so many socks and baselayer shirts and smartwool is the best. But avoid this!"
2.0,"The necklace on time; but the hook was on the side of the necklace, irregular product.  I had to purchase another necklace because of poor quality."
2.0,"Way too large for me.  Unfortunately, I cannot use these gloves for the reason I bought them.  No way to really try before you buy, and for $11, I won't waste my time trying to return them."
2.0,Bigger than expected. Returning
2.0,Looks nice but item is stiff hard to get undone to take watch off
2.0,"Great color and feel but less than a week after purchase, the sewing on the strap started to unravel."
2.0,"Not well made, socks keep on slipping . I do it recommend them .."
2.0,"They are comfortable and they look good on me. However I thought the waistband was going to be like most high waisted leggings are (an actual waistband) and they aren’t. See a comparison in the picture.<br /><br />The waist is just an elastic band with the fabric wrapped around it. I really don’t like that and wouldn’t have bought it if I had known. I kept them though, didn’t return them."
2.0,Did not fit. Too small. Was cute though
2.0,I liked them but they should be sized bc I couldn't get them on my toe and tried to make it bigger wasn't able to without damaging the products. Please make bigger ones.
2.0,"Too tight, smaller than expected!"
2.0,"I really liked this band. It was very pretty, fit well, and comfortable. The elastic broke after just two weeks, so I had to return it."
2.0,"Came in undersized.  If you need a large, you need to order at least two sizes up.  Disappointed my wife for Christmas ☹️"
2.0,"I am 37 weeks pregnant. I ordered a small and they fit great. I’m 125 regularly and now up to 155lbs. I gave these 3 stars because they are SO see through. You can read the inside tag through the back when I’m wearing them. In my opinion it isn’t worth the money. I got the 2 pack, light mark grey and dark mark grey. The dark grey oddly seem to be more awe through that the light grey. I already washed them so I can’t return."
2.0,"I ordered this necklace to say &#34;Jill&#34; and that little cursive swoop up at the end, makes it look like &#34;Jillo.&#34;  I was so bummed.  It's starting to tarnish too, before I can even get it shipped back."
2.0,It came from China -- on a very slow boat. I lost patience and ordered another band that arrived way before this one which is what I originally ordered. The other band is far superior to this. This one is cheap junk and not worth more than a few cents.
2.0,"I'm usually a size small(4) but I got the medium based off of reviews and wanting a little more coverage since my backside is a little bigger. This bikini had very little coverage and has a low cut.(I could barely cover my crack from showing) If I went any larger, it would fall off my hips. They also arrived with some white substance on them that looked and smelled like mediated powder(like gold bond). I returned the product after trying them on."
2.0,"The material is very thin, is not as cozy as the picture looks"
2.0,"Cute, but broke as soon as I got it. Read reviews about it being cheap, and I ignored them.<br />The material is not strong at all."
2.0,"The design is hilarious and cute, and the ears are adjustable, but the fabric is way too wall and wide. It's baggy and doesn't fit right. I have an average sized face and typically don't have an issue with masks. This one has too much fabric and looks gawky. When I pulled it apart to adjust the nose piece, it goes from my chin up to close to my eyebrows."
2.0,"The hay is soft, has a good color and looks like the picture. The actual graphic on the hat feels like a sticker."
2.0,"akk! looks like this is one of those that you can only leave one review for the product even though the stitching/quality/comfort of the product varies ALLOT between the variations.<br />Be aware this brand ships with one cups inside out and pressed into the other cup. This crushes the outside edge of one of the cups. (the one that's supposed to be smooth, and shows as wrinkles on your shirt)<br /><br />36D- Navy/Peach- the awful one. The sewing on this one is much worse compared to all the other variations of this style. Coloring on navy is rather poorly done, the tan underlining shows through badly through the unexpectedly sheer layer of navy fabric. The peach is much better, more like a slightly yellow tan color. This cup is markedly BIGGER vs the 36C, this is not as pronounced in the ""Curve Muse Women Plus Size Push Up Add 1 Cup Underwire Perfect Shape Lace Bras""<br />34D Dark Purple/Black- really really. pretty band is just a bit small, 4-star if I could get a slightly larger band<br />36C Nude/Turquoise- fits well, but nude color is a bit yellow for me<br />The cup size between the 34D and 36C is close to identical, like it's supposed to be."
2.0,Took forever to come in! Really love the look! Just like the picture
2.0,"I purchased an XL. It fits tight. The heart feels like a thicker iron on. Not sparkly. Poorer quality than I expected. And honestly, I don’t feel that this is the same product as advertised."
2.0,Definitely get what you pay for. Cheap. Colors wore off in a week. I’d make your own. Cute set up though.
2.0,"Thickness ok.  Looks ridiculous.  Quite a bit longer than shown in picture.  When is on, it makes you look like a circus announcer."
2.0,Lamente devolver este vestido porque la sisa estaba muy grande para la talla
2.0,This ran really small. The fabric is very pretty but no stretch at all.
2.0,"The top part of the dress is too loose, And looked weird even with a slip, otherwise a really pretty dress"
2.0,"super thin fabric.<br />guess we get what we paid for.<br />if I knew it was from china, I wouldn't have bought.<br />I didn't know...my bad"
2.0,Just was not snug enough. If I lay them down hard them come out which resulted in scratches.
2.0,"Nice looking glasses but cheap as heck!  The lens popped out in like the first 30 minutes.  I've cleaned them once or twice and already the reflective material is scratching!  Trust me or the retailer.  I live in Hawaii and wear glasses everyday.  If ur going to waste your time and order these, best u live in someplace where you can't find them and want to add attribute to some silly costume.  Cause that's about all these glasses are worth.  Alo'ha!"
2.0,"Mine weren’t clip on they were regular earrings, still cute but had to be put back together because one ring wasn’t closed completely"
2.0,"These are definitely lounge pants. They do not look like the cute pants that are great for an outing like in the picture. They are more like pjs. They do not have the ribbed tight, elastic bottoms that are in the picture/description.<br /><br />They are, however, very soft and will make comfortable pjs."
2.0,"This is the second time Qiyun has sent me the wrong color necklace - as before, the color I received was not even on their list of choices.  I ordered the very pretty purple and got an ugly green with brown flecks.  Its too much of a hassle to send these things back so I'm stuck with it. Also a piece fell out in the shipping.  It seems these folks run out of a color and then send whatever they have laying around.  Well, its a good thing I didn't pay too much for this.  I'm kind of disgusted since this seems to be a pattern with this company."
2.0,"Pros: It is a nice large size.<br /><br />Cons: It is EXTREMELY thin! It really just falls all over the place when I try to put it on, so &#34;fits as expected&#34; is sort of humorous. The problem is not the style, I have others this style. The problem is the fabric.<br /><br />Bottom line: I would NOT recommend this to a friend."
2.0,Style is great but the material is so cheap
2.0,I probably will not buy this product again.
2.0,I did not use it
2.0,"I love the motif, but it is really small and not as well made as I would have liked. Had I seen it in person first, I probably would have not purchased it. I’m sad."
2.0,Didn’t get mermaid on bag
2.0,"the arm is too long, they feel like they are going to break anytime, most of time they are not adjusted, one arm is higher than the other, the hinge feels weak"
2.0,"So this was EXTREMELY BIG.. Like huge?! I washed it & dried it and it did not shrink! It's just to big to be comfortable, I'm 5'5 & 160, I was hoping it was gonna fit just like a big tshirt but this shirt is really like size 3x!!?? So a little confused & I'm very disappointed in the product itself... I will have to use a hair tie to make it fit right.."
2.0,Not even close to being a 2XL.  Per the size chart that is for a 50-52 inch chest.  I could barely get it over my shoulders and my arms were very tight in the sleeves.  No way I could wear a suit coat under it.
2.0,Seams are coming undone on the side of the tank. I have only worn it once. Very disappointed.
2.0,"These are cute and fit fine. Unfortunately, the rubber gave off such noxious fumes that my daughter couldn’t wear them without giving the entire family a headache. We aired them outside for a week and they’re still intolerable. Choose something else."
2.0,I wanted to love this top but I was surprised when I arrived that it was so boxy and stiff. From the pictures it looks like it's a soft flowy blouse but its definitly not. Unfortunately I returned it.
2.0,This product is not flattering.
2.0,The reviews are right about the tightness in the shorts.  I am consulting with a seamstress to see if they can be let out.
2.0,Way too small for tag size.  Material is like cotton tissue that has been hardnend
2.0,These are VERY thin and don't do much to keep the sweat from pouring into your eyes. I'm not a heavy sweater at all and they don't really work for me. I thought they'd be thicker. The band tends to roll onto itself instead of staying spread out as a band. Spend a little more and get something that will absorb and stay put.
2.0,"The gloves are sarcastically large and the hat isn't sewn where it folds, so the fleece lining sticks out if you don't put it just right... which would be fine if this were for an adult, but is a hassle for my 5 year old."
2.0,"I own 5 other Latico bags and a wallet- this is the first product of theirs I've ever returned. I was VERY excited about it, but when it showed up I was disappointed. The leather is beautiful and the hide was lovely (just like my other Latico bags), but the stitching just seemed off compared to the quality of my other Latico bags. This bag is unlined, and the stitching was a bit looser than normal so I could see light coming through the bottom where the seams came together, other spots had thread ends sticking out.  Also problematic (for me) were the proportions of this bag. It is awkwardly wide, but has virtually no depth front to back. Check the measurements. Cut out a piece of cardboard and hold it up. It's a weird size and looked awkward on my shoulder. I'm sad that this bag didn't work out for me, but I still love Latico and will probably just look for a different bag made in the same color combination."
2.0,"Did not like the width of the upper stitch/hem part of the shirts. They seem like nice shirts, I returned them. My search continues for a replacement for the Equipo branded once found at Kohl's stores."
2.0,White is not good for this dress
2.0,To short.  I am 5’10.  Wasted money on this costume!
2.0,"Weak springs, failed easily causing the clip to not secure."
2.0,"You really don't need this product. Being a first time mom I thought it was a clever product, but I never used them!"
2.0,Dress was way to short for both of us.
2.0,"Think of the material that an underslip is made of--the material of this dress is slightly thicker than that. The description says it is primarily polyester and a bit spandex so I was wasn't expecting great fabric, but this is not wearable in public. I suppose it would work as a nightgown, though it would be hot with all of that polyester. It is way too stretchy for a flowy maxi, too. It does this weird springy/bouncy thing as you walk. It is too bad. I love the print and the cut, but it is simply made out of the wrong type of fabric. I should have known better spending only $17.<br /><br />Sizewise, it ran a bit big. I'm 5'8&#34; and bought a large, which is the size I typically wear at the &#34;Cartwheel&#34; store, but large has a bit too, roomy."
2.0,"Does not look like the picture, it was a little shorter then what it is on this model.. Thought it would be more like a sweater dress, was not."
2.0,This garment did not meet my expectations at all. The material is stiff and it doesn't feel comfortable. I like linen for its smooth and soft feel - absent here. The size is smaller than my size in other garments. Disappointed.
2.0,"I have a couple things wrong with this shirt.<br />1st is it had a terrible smell upon arrival that couldn't be washed out<br />2nd the seems we're unbelievably uneven, so bad that I had to take the shirt to a tailer<br />3rd it's short on my torso and I'm only 5'1<br />4th the arms are very lose when the body fits sort of tight.<br />I'm usually never a negative reviewer but I was really looking forward to this order."
2.0,"bikini top was too small and the bottoms were too big, it barely covers on top and it wasn't long enough for my torso either, i would not buy this. i have bought monokinis before and have never had as much trouble as i did with this one."
2.0,"So the dress fits fine, but I just can't see paying $30 for this. The material is SUPER thin and basically see through. Could have been the color I got, but you could see my black bra completely and thong lines also. Also I got the orange color and it was more of a bright tangerine than actual orange. I worried about the thin piece of elastic on the top of the dress, if it pops, then the whole top would come falling down. There are much better strapless dresses out there with a heavier material and made better. Returned this one."
2.0,"the neck was too small. of all things... i am tall, so i expected the length difference, i even expected some tighter shoulder area, but the neck hole is so constricting."
2.0,"The sticky part did its job, but the syncing with the rivets- over time (2-3 hours) that I wore them out, the rivets on the bottom of the sticky bra stretched out. I wish this was a stronger material in the middle of this bra."
2.0,Pocket stitching was missed. Not the greatest quality
2.0,The belt is well made and the buckle is also.  the problem is that the lever for releasing the belt rarely works well. If you remove your trousers you can maneuver the mechanism and release the belt.  Another way to release it is to turn it so you can access the lever while you release the belt manually. The idea is a good one but the execution leaves much to be desired.
2.0,"I would be extremely satisfied with this product if 2 of the tank tops (gray and red) were the same fit as the black one. I ordered medium sizes for all 3 tank tops. The tags for all 3 says medium size but when I tried it on, the black tank fitted perfectly but the red and gray ones seem to be loose. I compared and measured (even took pictures) all 3 tank tops, and the gray and red tank tops are about an inch and half bigger in size compared to the black tank top. The material is good but 2 of the sizes are way off which is very disappointing."
2.0,"The picture of the product is not what arrived.  We didn’t receive as many colors shown.  We received 5 green, 5 purple, 5 pink and 5 yellow.  These were purchased with the intention of changing the bracelet out to different colors but we only received 4 color options."
2.0,PANTS NOT AS WISHED TO BIG
2.0,Fuzz all over the place. The socks pil .
2.0,Does not look like the photo....kind of a shiny material!
2.0,I’m skinny and this dress still somehow made me look 10 pounds heavier. You guys it is SHEER.
2.0,"Nice material but the color is a lot darker then it looks in the picture and it exposes too much cleavage. I wanted it to be low cut but it stretched out almost immediately after washing and you can see my entire bra...and it's not very flatter if you don't have a super flat stomach. I ordered a size large I'm usually a size 10, seems true to size  but I don't really like the stretchy chest area. It makes th looks saggier and smaller then normal even though I'm a size DD."
2.0,"Update:<br />After washing this once, on gentle cold, it shrank nearly a full size. It became awkwardly short, too tight in the chest, and one of the back seams ripped open. I am not impressed with the fabric or construction quality.<br /><br />Original review:<br />Overall, I really enjoy wearing this dress! I feel a bit Grace Kelly at a beach party in it. You can dress it a bit up or down, depending on how you accessorize it. It pairs well with simple, classy sandals, an understated necklaces, and smooth wavy hair for an effortless yet sophisticated summer vibe.<br /><br />The lightweight, breezy fabric is wonderful in hot weather! There is even a snap to keep the buttons in the front from gaping. I am 5'7"", 135lbs, and 36/27/37, and the small fits me well, maybe a tad roomier than most size smalls are on me. But it is a looser style.<br /><br />I do wish that the skirt lining was longer; it is too short for me to wear my usual black shorts under the dress as the bottom of the black shorts can barely be seen peeping out from the lining through the lightweight outer fabric. It's not super obvious, but I add an extra slip underneath. Also, the plastic snap is so hard to un-snap that it would sooner rip off of the dress than come undone, which is quite frustrating.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Soft fabric<br />Lightweight and breezy<br />Lined bodice<br />Partially lined skirt<br />Beautiful colors<br />Snap to keep button front from gaping<br />Fits true to size<br /><br />Cons:<br />Slightly see-through fabric due to thinness<br />Skirt lining too short<br />Snap too tight to come undone easily"
2.0,"I love the bag. Great size, good color. Quality.. Not so great. Pieces have broken after only a month of use. Wish the quality was better."
2.0,"The sunglasses arrived crooked out of the box - see picture attached.  There's no way to bend it to symmetry, and as a result, they sit on my nose tilted some, and uncomfortable.  This particular flawed pair made it through quality control somehow.  It's unfortunate, because I liked everything else about it, especially the light weight."
2.0,This item I bought as a gift for my sister who is a very big fan of this anime and do I make a good value for your money no not at all most of the anime characters on the bracelet Wear Yellow she cannot wear it anymore because she got cut by it many times I am very disappointed I would just say think twice before buying it
2.0,The colors and materials for these Gaiters are very nice but the elastic isn't tight enough to stay on my face :(
2.0,"Firstly WOW, are you kidding me, This looks like a 13 year old sewed this. There were strands of string coming out every where. Then the folds stuck out of the lines. It was AWFUL made. I could have sewn this together better myself. I can believe i paid 13$ for this when it probably costs about 5$ or so to make it.  I had to take scissors to it and cut off all the strings and extra material that hung off the sides and the lines in the front.  It took forever to arrive as well. SUCH a disappointment, yet i paid money for it so yea i'm still going to wear it. Just want to let other people know to have LOW expectations of this product."
2.0,You get what you pay for but this thing sheds like crazy!
2.0,Doesn't do much for night driving.
2.0,"I buy this brand (Secret Treasures) of fleece pajama/lounging pants on-line all the time because of my confidence in knowing that they are consistent in their sizing (a Medium now will be the same size as the Medium that came before it).  Until now.  This pair does not fit like all the others in the past.  This pair is way too short between the waist and the center of the crotch.  So much so, that I can't comfortably wear them (they'll be going in the donations box)."
2.0,Screw that holds the Focus portion on the ball easily works out. Had to use a thread lock product to keep it together.
2.0,"I wanted to love this sweater. It is too bulky and isn't as pretty in person as in the picture. I am tall and slender but it made me look heavier. There is also lots of extra bunching under the armpit that makes it very uncomfortable. It is also scratchy, not like the other sweater I bought from the same company. Had to return."
2.0,The description made me like them and want to buy them. They arrived a few days ago and not comfortable at all. The arch support is minimal. The yoga mat is so thin you don’t feel it. It’s like walking on the hard floor. The heels are hard every step I take. Not at all what I was expecting. I’m giving them a 2 because I’ll still wear them since I have them but I can’t use them for long periods. Don’t be fooled. Will not buy again.
2.0,The dress was cheaply made. Didn't exactly  match the picture posted. Very snug around the arms and bust. I am a size 18 and the largest size fit but not well. It was flimsy. It does have some stretch.
2.0,"You certainly get what you pay for. although the design is innovative, I had so many problems with this watch, setting the time, keeping the time, finally the battery ran out. I replaced the battery and now my watch is stuck on 120...cant be set to anything else. Oh well, makes a great cat toy as my loves love looking at it."
2.0,Doesn't fit well. Didn't like it enough to try to find the right size.
2.0,It's cheap and came in two... but cannot be a replacement for the tory burch scarf I accidentally ruined in the drying :'(
2.0,I have just received it today. The bracelet is not like I thought it would have a lot smaller. The clasp does not tightly as I thought.
2.0,Leg bottoms to large
2.0,I had to return it. Too large.
2.0,Wont stay put so it was a waste of money
2.0,"I really love this hat and shipping was good. However after a few weeks of light wear the hat is already broken. It WAS my favorite hat, now I can't even wear it."
2.0,"The way this dress fit was just bizarre. It fit right in the waist and bust. However, it was totally falling off the shoulders from being too big, but cutting off circulation at my biceps from being too small. Most people my size have larger arms than I do, so it seemed very odd. The dress also hung somewhat strangely. I’ve worn empire waist dresses before, so I know it’s not supposed to fit that way."
2.0,"So it was my understanding, as I read the description for these insoles, that they were designed “primarily” for people with flat feet.  The arch in these insoles is wayyyy too high - it felt like I had a golf ball under my arch. In addition, the sizing seems to be on the short side of the ranges that are give for this product. I got these in the 13-13.5, but they feel more like 12.5-13."
2.0,These weren’t actually cotton as described. So I couldn’t do what I wanted with them.
2.0,"This is a gorgeous backpack but the main zipper broke after only a month of use. Very disappointed as I love the look, and the functionality."
2.0,Had to return. Too large.
2.0,"The mask is too small to cover face from bridge of nose to under chin for best protection...Smaller than what's pictured<br /><br />It is NOT Tommie Copper, Community Style mask, that was my mistake in believing it was...<br /><br />No GO ever again"
2.0,Kind of cheaply made and small.
2.0,Pockets are sewn on the inside or the seams are facing outside??? I bought 2. One has pockets the other doesn't. The other without pockets have the sleeves sewed on the wrong side too!
2.0,I ended up returning.  The shirt is kind of shapeless and seemed very low quality.
2.0,"It's super cute, but it's scratchy and uncomfortable.  A bead came off after only one wear, as well."
2.0,There is nothing i liked about this dress. To big. Too clingy!
2.0,"They were extremely small, they don't fit a size 6 woman's foot.  They are also very thin and I put holes in them trying to get them on"
2.0,"Soft material but even though it's just a nightgown, the fit is not flattering at all."
2.0,"These shorts are cute, but they are extremely short and cheaply made. They are not properly hemmed, and the bottom is starting to unravel even before they are worn. The material is thin and you can see through it."
2.0,"I ordered this from their website and was disappointed:<br />* The markings are extremely small, even on a rather large size 12 ring.<br />* The edges are not smooth, and were sharp enough to scratch the back of my phone.<br /><br />I won't be wearing it."
2.0,"Material is basically like a thick pantyhose.  So during my first time wearing them, it has a weak spot in the material and puts a &#34;run&#34; in the material from one end to the other.  These are ready for the trash..."
2.0,"I wanted to love this shirt.  I bought the 2Xl because I wanted a thin, baggy shirt like the one in the picture.  Unfortunately, the mannequin in the image must be tiny.  When I received the shirt, it was thin, the neck was nicely scooped, but it was one of the smallest 2XL's I've ever purchased.  The 2XL fits like a generous Medium.  Definitely not ""flowy"".  It is constructed well and the fabric feels great, so I won't say it was a complete waste - just not the shirt that is described."
2.0,Ok to wear these in public if you're the type that thinks leggings are pants.<br /><br />Not for me.
2.0,"I bought a size larger than typical so it would be loose. It’s actually really tight! I would go up by at least two sizes, maybe 3."
2.0,"really thin and feel fragile, nice gloves but do not feel like sturdy leather that i can get somewhere else for 40$"
2.0,"Very thin metal, simple to the point of looking cheap. Feel lightweight as well.  Edges are relatively sharp and should have been more polished and rounded.  Was expecting a more brushed look as they appeared in the pictures, however they have a shiny finish.  Can be easily bent to accommodate thicker or thinner ties."
2.0,The straps are not adjustable and way too short for the dress to fit nicely.
2.0,"I like the product, but only have had them for a little while and the seam in the thumb has came undone."
2.0,Waaayyy too big around and super short for women over 5’8
2.0,Should say in description must nbe dry cleaned
2.0,"It is too small for me, very tight!"
2.0,Not for short people
2.0,To tight in the arms
2.0,"Really pretty and cool, but one of them broke in just a few days :("
2.0,Very undersized for what is normal sizing in the US. Had to return them.
2.0,"I didn't expect these to last since they are so inexpensive but a few weeks in and already the lights are messed up, not charging, ect. Oh well."
2.0,I loved this so much but it broke right before I wore it! I had to rig it for my performance because it was too late to do anything about it.
2.0,Fabric was great. Top fits as expected. Way too tight around the legs but fits otherwise on the bottoms.
2.0,"I don’t think this shirt sits well for women with larger chests. I’m a size 36D and the crumple affect you’re supposed to get in the sense that shirt is a bit loose at the top, did not occur. The shirt is super cute, and if it had fit properly, I would have kept it."
2.0,Cheap product...but worth checking out!!
2.0,"I loved it - it was all shiny and very pretty.  All of a sudden, I look down and it's completely tarnished.  I wrote the company 3 times asking how I could clean it and they never replied back, so I guess it's ruined!  :("
2.0,This dress is waaaaaay to short. I’m 5’7” and this dress fit like a tunic. Had to return.
2.0,"A little small, and the fabric is really light, looks kind of cheap. Is not the most flattering g on me, but is comfortable and hasn’t faded yet."
2.0,"The belt that arrived was not the same color as pictured above.  The 'gold' lace was more ivory than gold, so this belt did not make the outfit.  I was supposed to return it, but forgot, so it will go in the donation pile."
2.0,"These gloves are poorly made.  The ones I ordered are suppose to be large however they barely fit and if I pull too hard they come apart at the seams.  My doctor wanted me to wear a cotton glove and a water proof glove when I take a shower.  So these gloves work, if I don't pull too hard when putting them on.  They work OK for the 15 min in the shower but they would not be very good for longer use or for use without the protection water proof glove."
2.0,It's Super cute and got a lot of compliments but it broke 3 days after I bought it.
2.0,I ordered according to size chart and still way too small. Returned!
2.0,"Looks pretty in picture but cheaply made, flimsy buyer beware!!"
2.0,I don't know what is going on with this dress. I don't even know how to go about fixing it to make it work.<br />I have a good figure and this dress makes me look bleh
2.0,"I ordered an xl because i thought it would fit and they shipped me a medium. It wasnt even worth it to try and get another size. They smelled so weird, like the chemicals in the dye gave off such a bad smell"
2.0,The Beige was very peachy pink.  It looked and felt very cheap.
2.0,"Good price and design, but too small to wear."
2.0,"Fun pattern. It's a little smaller than expected, and it shrank a full size in the wash."
2.0,So the dress is gorgeous. I returned it bc the waist was too short. I’m 5’10” and the length was just too short.
2.0,Cute dress and material feels good but in less than 2 months (despite washing in a lingerie bad and hanging to dry) the material is fuzzing and there is a hole in it. Should last longer than this.
2.0,Its okay.... Once you put credit cards in the slots it doesn't snap together very well. Wish there were a place for checkbook.
2.0,So very pretty and shiny. Bought them as a gift and wanted my own pair. There are 3 holes to have at different lengths. But then I realized the jackets were two different lengths even with the holes you wouldn't be able to make them fit right. So I returned them and ordered from another vendor.<br /><br />I did get the marquise from this vendor and those I love.
2.0,It is very cute but it broke when I put it on my daughter...
2.0,Too small but the product looks good.
2.0,"Because the size is too small, very different that the reference table. I'm disagree with the product"
2.0,Can't get it on. MW
2.0,"They fit but  I bought them to be active in,  running, walking... they slowly ride up. Have to keep pulling them down. I'll keep them but not for working out in."
2.0,"Light tubes are very thin and not super bright. Within 20 minutes of wearing it, several of the lights had broken, leaving very sharp edges we had to tape off so my child didn't cut themself. The power boxes for the lights were also bulky and a pain to deal with. Do not recommend."
2.0,The belt is as tough as old leather!!!<br />Not at all comfortable- one out of ten on my rating!!!
2.0,Didn’t fit to what the description says<br />But the feeling was of the product was great.
2.0,"no se ve mal,  pero no es como se observa en  la foto"
2.0,Hard to walk in no support that holds the to your feet
2.0,I have a hour glass shape - so it just folded on its self at my waist - this you need a more  straight waist for this to work.  so sad because it would look great if it laid flat
2.0,Broken chain.  Poor quality 98th
2.0,"If you have a long torso, then this isn't the suit for you. I even ordered a size larger and the &#34;neck&#34; was just above my cleavage. I'm 5'5&#34;, 130 pounds and ordered a large"
2.0,I got this for my fiancé. It's a pretty dress and fits perfectly but it had a rip on the side.
2.0,smells soooo strong & rubbery but...what can I say. You get what u pay for. Still a nice bag (brand says &#34;minmin&#34;..read carefully)
2.0,Faded after a while.
2.0,The clasp that hooks it to the watch keeps disconnecting. I almost lost the watch. Not a good replacement band.
2.0,"Waaaaay to small. I'd expect this to be for flat chested woman or children... I am a small woman with only size C breasts, and it wont even cover all of my boobs... way too tiny!!"
2.0,"Assumed I was purchasing the $12.99 bracelet...wrong. Received this one with a chain on it and have gone back and forth with manufacturer until I have given up and kept the wrong ones. Show me a chain on this ad...there is none. Nice for the price but picture is deceiving; looks like the $12.99 bracelet.<br /><br />What a mess I have dealt with.  Amazon was very nice and very fair, but manufacturer is in China and their English e-mails are hard to understand. Obviously, I do not speak Chinese.  Go with the $12.99 flip flop bracelet and good luck!"
2.0,"The sticky stuff to keep the bra on you comes off when you wear it and gets all over the place. It doesn't stay on very well, either."
2.0,Generously sized?! This hat is so big it covers my entire head & face!  Maybe if I was Shaq it might fit but no.  Way too big!
2.0,Expected tighter fit around midsection
2.0,"Pros:  Colors, material<br />Cons:  Do not fit adults - smashed my nose<br />Had to return"
2.0,It broke very fast
2.0,Not true to size I am busty and always order a bigger size but I would need to order 1 size up from what I would normally order
2.0,Not really what I expected.  Very thin.  Going to keep in our cars for a backup.
2.0,This skirt reminded me of something I made in Home Economics class in school. The fabric is like sack cloth and completely see-through if you stand in the light. It has no lining. There were loose threads and poor quality stitching in many different areas of the item and the hem was uneven. I am 5 foot 3 and 115 pounds and the waist was to tight to be comfortable. I returned this.
2.0,even thow theres size options i dont think there actually is different sizes for these theyre waaaay to small for an xl
2.0,Didn’t like material felt cheap
2.0,Dislike because the clip-on wires won't let the glasses rest on the right place.
2.0,"I really like these joggers, I liked them so much at first that i after they arrived I came on here and bought a 2nd pair in different color.  Unfortunately, they both ripped after a few wears.  One lasted about a week, ripped while trying to put them on.  I simply pulled them up and they ripped, the 2nd one I was being very careful with because I could tell from the first one that they were made out of cheap material.  Well, even like that the 2nd one ripped after 3 weeks or so, this one the stitching ripped on the back."
2.0,So thin!
2.0,It's tiny and illegable.
2.0,Fairly sure they sent two of the same shoes!  Not worth the $$.  Spend a little more and get better quality and if you’re lucky a right and left shoe.
2.0,It was very cute but it was still too snug. I'm disappointed but I expected this.
2.0,This is cute and would have been nice if it had been a different fabric.  After one wash it becomes clingy (not from static) and you have to constantly pull it away from your legs.  Plus it pills very easily.  I don’t see most people being able to wear it more than a couple times.
2.0,It turned black :( is very pretty
2.0,"The cut in the bottom was not right for me at all. I'm not sure if it's my hips or body type but it made my thighs look like they were 10 sizes too small even though the rest fit.  I understand this is a retro look but for some reason it didn't look retro, just I'll fitting. As a busty lady the top fit well which was disappointing since it's hard to find those that fit. I returned this swimsuit unfortunately."
2.0,The loops on this dress that hold it together stretch while wearing sonunless u have a slip under u can see through the middle all the way ups no down
2.0,"The product image shows this dress as maybe not quite swing or trapeze, but definitely loose-fitting. The dress I got in Medium (my usual size) was much more body con than I expected, and didn't work for my purposes. Will be returning."
2.0,"The color doesn't of the skirt doesn't even come close to how its shown on the picture, its yellow with pink flowers."
2.0,Kind of cheap looking and feeling thick polyester.
2.0,"The style was nice, but they were so small. My son, who has very thin feet, couldn't fit into them at all. I would say they are probably 2 sizes too small."
2.0,Its okay.  Reason is that the small parts at the end of the pull strings to open and close  it broke off this week.  Just got  it.  Still opens and closes but those end pieces definitely were not put  on to last.
2.0,"We loved the mask, but one side of the face stuck out and the other stuck in, so the face shape is severely warped. My kid didn’t mind and will be wearing it anyway, but I can clearly see it’s misshapen. Somewhat poorly made."
2.0,"After the first wash, it created a lot of lint, and the stitches were undone.<br />Size is fit as expected."
2.0,Don’t plan on being able to see or breathe
2.0,"It itches my ears, nice design though"
2.0,It sheds. Not happy with the quality.
2.0,"It’s Cute print and Seems well made, but the lace sticks out (I also don’t have much chest to fill it out.) It’s not as long in person, as it is the picture. I wear this as a comfy/pajama shirt but I would see this on anyone else and think ‘what a cute little top.’"
2.0,Broke as soon as I put it on. Bust is tight while shoulder area just flops loosely. Not very flattering. I'm 5'3 and weigh 225.
2.0,"Ok, this will be my last purchase of cheap Chinese-made cloths. While the design is interesting, the fabric looks rather cheap. I normally wear M, but after reading comments ordered L. Fits just fine. However, the belt is not cut in a traditional way - it's kind of like an extension of the skirt, and continues narrowing as it goes up (not straight), following the cut of the skirt. Because of this it gets tighter than it should normally be at the very top of the belt, which wouldn't appen should it be sewn in a standard way. Yes, cheap product, they are cutting corners here they can. But most importantly, the hem is uneven!  I can't understand how one should cut it to make it so uneven???  It's not the first time with cheap Chinese cloths. I decided to keep it as it's cheap and not worth going through the hassle of returning it, and I may wear it once in a while for very informal occasion, like my dance practice. Otherwise - wouldn't buy it again."
2.0,Cute shirt. Fits well. But came with a hole in the sleeve on the seam.
2.0,"This item would have been perfect if the whole thing wasn't a micro mesh. I assumed that the ""mesh"" in the description was the detail at the top of the leo. Unfortunately the entire body of the leo is also a micro mesh which renders it see-through. I was really disappointed because the cut, color, and the idea for the design would have been exactly what I was looking for."
2.0,"Love the way these fit. HATE that after three months, the fabric is coming apart and there are holes on the uppers. Too expensive to fall apart so soon."
2.0,"La verdad es q en la modelo se ve mejor q en persona, el material está ok, pero si eres de cadera ancha como yo, puede q te quede Muy ajustado la parte trasera ya q no es muy elástico. Por eso no me gusto porq dice ser súper cómodo y no lo es."
2.0,"No cushion on the heal of the foot, my husband complained after a week of wearing them"
2.0,the lower band kept rolling --poor quality
2.0,The item was broken and damaged inside the packaging but the packaging itself was fine and the shipping was fairly quick but my only issue is that the item was unusable when I received it
2.0,Wet not good
2.0,"The red which represents Texaco, the American oil retail brand that partnered with M racing in its early days, needs to be brighter. It looks more like crimson here. The light blue which represents BMW and the Bavarian flag is leaning dangerously close to aquamarine here and is unacceptable. The middle color that represents the partnership needs to be more blue than purple.<br /><br />You might as well have just thrown in random colors and called it a day. The colors are important people. Get them right. How hard can it be?<br /><br />The quality of the band is pretty good though."
2.0,"It is a nice heavy ring, but description says it is a satin finish and it is definitely is a highly polished finish."
2.0,"I bought these to wear with my Indian dress and some of my boho pants. These are very low quality and junky. They fit well but are just pretty cheap costume jewelry. Also the company does NOT take returns so if your item comes with jewels falling out, they only replace and you are stuck with subpar material"
2.0,Sewing Thread is too weak - pockets threads come undone
2.0,"not impressed. Very cheaply made and sizing is ridiculous. I ordered my usual xl and I doubt my daughter who is S/M would even fit. If I reordered I'd probably need 2 or 3 sizes up. If you have anything above a B cup, forget it, them buttons will not fasten. Material is very light and arrived super crushed- from the feel of it even if I could wear it, it would be permanently crushed. Also product has warnings about shrinkage and washing on cold and not tumble drying- probably because this item feels like it will shrink. That along with the ridiculously off sizing means what size you are is a total guessing game."
2.0,"I was excited about this shirt until I received it. The print quality is low and the size runs small. I ordered a large and it still fit, but feels more like a medium on. I didn’t return it because for the price, it wasn’t worth the hassle."
2.0,The stitching on the zipper came apart the first day she carried the bag. This left small torn holes in the backpack where the stitching was. So disappointing😞
2.0,"The description states that this fits waists between 28"" and 36"".  My waist is 32"" and it won't fit. I would need to be about 28"" for it to fit as in the pictures."
2.0,So the dress itself is pretty but it’s not what is shown on Amazon and I know I’m not a model but….it’s not what’s displayed.
2.0,"Does not have white stripes, they are grey. I have been out of town and now they cannot be returned 😕."
2.0,I did not find these kept my feet warm when outside shoveling snow for 20 mins at 30 degrees.  Did not even keep my feet warm in the house unless wearing slippers too.  Would not recommend.
2.0,The color pattern was a solid grey color even though the picture shows a contrasting color combination of light grey up top and dark grey on the legs. Also the sizing is way too big. The medium firs like a an extremely baggy 34. Quality seems decent otherwise but hard to tell without wearing.
2.0,"Extremely thin.  If it is leather, it feels like the thinnest leather I've ever seen embossed onto cardboard.  Latch isn't spring-loaded, it's just a slide, which at least with me might cause the watch face to be disconnected with more rugged use."
2.0,"Bought this for a Kentucky Derby themed event.  I was looking for something a bit larger.  Well crafted, just too small for my liking."
2.0,"Although these are “cover ups”...they are very large. I bought the large/xl size and the waistband needs to be rolled up several times to fit. Very cheap material, not likely to stand up well to walking through brush. Love the pattern, but could be a little lighter"
2.0,I ordered white and the bottom is a light taupe color while the top is bright white. It's not a winner by any means.
2.0,Very Disappointed!<br />The pocket stitching has come undone with only a couple of uses.<br />I liked the style and material but without pockets it's useless for tennis
2.0,It doesn't fit true to size. I normally wear a small. I bought a medium. And it was still quite small. It barely covers my stomach and still shows my wrists at the arm length
2.0,Works fine. Holds pants up. Was ok for a couple months but now the buckle makes a weird jingle (clinking) noise when I walk.
2.0,Makes me look big
2.0,Fluffy but sheds!  Fits tightly  not for me
2.0,Beautiful necklace but was cheap and did not last long
2.0,"The dress design is cute and lightweight, but was so short I couldn't even think about bending over at all. I'm 5'6, so I'm average height. This is not made for anyone even remotely tall. Also, the quality wasn't great. There were runs in the fabric and many long threads hanging from seams. I'm not sure that it would hold up in the washer or even to multiple wears. Disappointed and sending it back."
2.0,"By the picture, it looks as if the pink shades into a rich burgundy color. Nothing could be further from the truth - it shades into a muddy brown - it does not look good at all. Since this shipped from China, I won't be pursuing a return/refund. So, buyer beware for the pink blouse. Other than that, it seems to be well made. The material is a soft, thick polyester. Read thick as = warm. It is not something I would want to wear in hot weather, even if it is a short sleeve top. Also, it runs very small - even though I purchased the size indicate by the chart."
2.0,"This cap is very small and shallow for most adult head!  Plus,  the plastic piece in front really smells bad!<br />I certainly can not use it for work since the shield also wrinkles up so it is hard to see things.<br />I may use it for backyard gardening only,  if I can still see what is in front of me and not to bump into a tree."
2.0,"The quality is good, colors are good. It's too short to allow watch to lie flat, and you can't run the tail section back through the keepers."
2.0,Did not serve my purpose.
2.0,"Cheap product. The angle of the cat-eye is more extreme than shown in the pictures. The lenses are thin, cheap tinted plastic. They don't do much in the way of sunglasses. When you feel/hold them it's like you're holding children's dress up glasses. I'm considering just throwing them away. Also, the seller emails you incessantly asking for reviews."
2.0,Short. Small. Crap.<br />It fits my 9 year old. Not made for anyone adult size.
2.0,Way too small. I'm an XL and I ordered an XXL. Still way too tight. A shame because the dress is super cute.
2.0,The color of the band does not match the photo. It is very pink with only small flecks of gray rather than mostly gray as the photo shows. It looks like a completely different band.
2.0,"[[VIDEOID:c7fcceba272bdbab410cbcf4b7d29b0d]] I just got this today. I was already skeptical about how nice this would look in person - I was worried it’d look cheaply. I mean it is at an affordable price but sometimes you can find really nice pieces at a cheap price. However, this confirmed my skepticism. It looks like a bracelet you’d get out of a toy machine or even a gum-ball machine in all honesty. This would be fine for a child but if you’re looking to get this for your girlfriend/wife - I wouldn’t. It feels very flimsy and lightweight - I think this would break as soon as it got snagged on something. It also feels very cheap. I think any of the “stones” would fall out at some point - this just in of high or mediocre quality. It’s subpar. I’m bummed but not surprised. I’m not someone who cares for the fanciest and most lavish jewelry but I’ve gotten enough jewelry over the years to know when something is of nice quality and worth it’s affordable (or not) price point. I’ll still wear this because I got it and I like the colors but I don’t think it’ll last long. I also don’t think it’s hypo allergenic. I’m sure it’ll leave a green stain on my wrist after wear. Anyways, I am giving it 2 stars because the colors are pretty but that’s it. I don’t think it’s worth what it’s priced at on here. I wouldn’t pay no more than a few dollars for this."
2.0,"I love the design of the scarf but it had an awful smell, had to wash it!!  I washed it and the texture of the material changed and it still had a bad moldy smell."
2.0,"I was so disappointed when I finally received these bras, after being so excited about ordering them. They're super awkward and sit high, no matter how you try to adjust them, and the padding is ridiculously thick. I am a DD cup in any other bra I have ever had and this one was way too big"
2.0,I got it to be small and fit in my pocket  easing  and but it is really long I wanted small and skinny I get skinny but not small but if you want a big it's good
2.0,"I ordered a US size 4 and it was much too small. It was really tight on the bust and just barely fit at the waist. The cut on the shirt and the appearance of it once on was not nearly as attractive as the photo either. I am so disappointed in this purchase. I returned this item and did not have any trouble with customer service.<br />I am 5'5&#34;, 34 bust, 30 waist, 33 hips (average, slim build)."
2.0,They are wellmade; but do run small. My husband found them hard to get on.
2.0,Was disappointed Decal peeling.. looks like won’t make it through wash..
2.0,"way too big,<br />I had to return it"
2.0,bracelet too small to ft a small adult wrist
2.0,Purchased a medium for my boyfriend shirt is short in length and very wide does not fit him at all as it looks stretched out. Graphic is off center and looks cheap
2.0,The material and colors were great. Unfortunately they are too small. I have one on right now hoping it will stretch but I will have to take it off. It's so tight I can hardly breath.
2.0,"Based on the raving reviews here, I thought this bra would compete with my strapless Calvin Klein bra - but it definitely did not. It does not provide much in the way of support with the way the cups are designed. The band was too tight and the cups were too big. I also thought the underwire was quite uncomfortable. All in all I would say you get what you pay for, this feels like a cheap bra from China."
2.0,This purse is very small and the liner is not good quality.
2.0,I am average frame but these fit like I should have no butt. I guess if you have no butt they may fit great but they are not curved for a female rear end. The fabric is stiff and doesn't breathe. Not a great summer choice.
2.0,I loved tge design and color the material was also not too bad but the fit was off best for someone who isn't curvy like I am I did return for a refund
2.0,Really poor quality. Image is cropped missing the top part of the logo and the colors all bleed together.
2.0,"This battery was advertised and ordered as a ""SONY CR2430"". It was actually a RENATA CR2430 lithium battery. I contacted the seller and he described the battery sent as a quality battery. It was not worth the time and effort to return it but I will not purchase from this dealer in the future. The item was sent promptly and the price was good but when I order an item, I expect it to be exactly as I ordered. I would have probably accepted at least an explanation in the package as to WHY the Sony battery was replaced. I could have ordered a Renata battery from at least a dozen other dealers but I wanted a Sony. Also this review was sent once before but doesn't seem to be showing up on Amazon's site. This purchase was not a great deal of money and probably not worth the time invested in this review. But again, I expect to get exactly what I order from any vendor."
2.0,Not nearly long enough. It looks more like an old lady shirt. I'm also 5'2 and weigh 135. I ordered a large
2.0,"Love the green one, the red one is &#34;foggy&#34; on the top and bottom..."
2.0,"Pretty graphics, but hard to breath in these."
2.0,"nice looking swimming googles but they are not anti-fog as indicated and for some reason, they are blurry underwater.They are clear out of the water but for some reason, everything is blurry underwater. I thought maybe the water was the issue until I put on my old googles on. With my old googles, everything is clear underwater. The ear and nose piece are nice. The google is worthless. I'll spend more money next time."
2.0,"It's a nice looking tie, but I felt like it was falling apart before I even took it out of the package. I don't think it's very well-made, so I would not recommend it to anyone who would use it with a &#34;hands on&#34; job like teaching."
2.0,"Beautiful colors, was exactly what I wanted it to look like but sadly disappointed it was soo small for an 2x. Not made for the average American body"
2.0,if you expect something similar to Under Armor you would not be satisfied
2.0,"This was not a good purchase for a tragus piercing. I mean it was a good idea in theory but when you put it in its hard to angle the piece to even display the shape. It was also difficult to put it in and take it out. I cannot speak for other types of piercings, but this is not a good piece for tragus piercings."
2.0,The little dog house opens with Velcro but the stretching on one shoe was totally off besides a flap. Very disappointed in the craftsmanship!
2.0,"So, it came a little small for a xxl.  But what really irked me is the fact that the garment has a tendency to shed white cotton/woolish hairs all over the shirt that I wear it with.  If I am wearing a Black shirt, this hoodie is a No Go!  If you are a fan of Black, don't go here.  for the Price, somewhat should have expected poor fabric quality."
2.0,Just put away cause it was too small and fabric looks different from actual picture.
2.0,"Nice looking, but the thumbs were sown off kilter."
2.0,Recieved these today.  Very poorly made. Easily bends and doesn't stay closed well.  Not very sparkly either. Will be sending back!!
2.0,The flowers are pretty.  They stretch out too much.
2.0,It was a nice product but it was too small .
2.0,"made of very cheap material, thinner than I thought. The ribbons are a shiny, tacky cheap ass 1 dollar ribbons you can get at the dollar store. Where's the quality? I paid like a $100 dollars for this. There was no packaging to speak of either, it arrived in a clear plastic baggie. What the.... You can still lace up with it and use it but for the price, this is outrageous. what a markup."
2.0,"After 12 hrs of wearing, the socks leave indentations on my lower legs from the design stitching"
2.0,"Not as comfortable as I expected, got fog very easily with the face mask."
2.0,These pants run very very small.
2.0,"Baby tried on swimsuit and it fit as expected. The fabric appeared to be made of quality materials and was easy to change in and out of.  After initial wash(following directions on the label), so baby could use for first swim; I was disappointed to see that the navy bled onto the white polka dots making the suit look old and torn out."
2.0,The jacket doesn't look like the photo at all and it is bizarrely short.  The bottom of the jacket is nearly a full inch above my waistline.  I also can't even get it buttoned because this Large is so small.<br /><br />Ya get what you pay for I guess and this product is junk.
2.0,I loved this band and have gotten so many compliments but sadly after less than 2 months the design is rubbing off.
2.0,"I adore the hand painted design and real silk material.  This robe is really lovely... If only the little inside tie string had been stitched more carefully!  The first time I  wore it, I gently tied the inside closed before securing  outer belt. Call me strange, but I usually like to keep my breasts concealed inside my clothing even when I'm alone just walking around my house. Silk is slippery. You bet the picture.<br /><br />That little tie strap on the inside just fell off into my hand the first time I untied it. I'm a average framed, healthy and fit person (5'8&#34; 140 lbs) so there was no pushing, pulling or unusual stress to any of the seems and it was only used once for 20 minutes.<br /><br />With a $100 price tag, poor quality stitching like this is just unacceptable."
2.0,"The lettering on the item that I received looks nothing like the illustration.  It is in script instead of print and is so small that it is impossible to read, even with a magnifier"
2.0,This is a beautiful dress. The embroidery is vibrant and well done. The dress looks much more expensive than it is. My biggest complaint is the sizing. It is not even close. I easily could have gone up two sizes.
2.0,This is not a product design for plus people.. the design of the letter are in cheap vinyl and the quality of the fabric feel like you are wearing a plastic bag.<br />Not recommended at all.
2.0,"Left one was missing the clasp. Have to send them back...cute shoes, but I listened to the reviews and went a half size down because everyone kept saying how big they were. Sure enough, I should have gone with my size because the half size down was too small."
2.0,Joint weak and fails to hold after using only a few times.
2.0,"arrived with chipped coating. the negative spaces of the chips look like boogers stuck to my nose ring, which isn’t suuuper cute."
2.0,Cute dress but had to return. Too sheer.
2.0,I just got back last weekend from a trip and I have to say the bag seems very nice but was very disappointed to have the letters fall off not even 20 minutes into my trip.  This now worries me that a bigger hole will form where the letter was attached to the bag.
2.0,"Hard to breath, mouth opening too small."
2.0,Very inexpensive so that's good but feels super cheap and flimsy. Better off getting a $50 Walmart watch.
2.0,"Bought bc I thought it was a bathing suit, it's just a cover and it's made cheaply."
2.0,They were neat to have but I had several that didn't work. I wrote the company and I did not get a reply back.
2.0,So the first one I bought was too big and there was a hole in the shoulder. In the process of sending it back. I did order a smaller size and it's great I love it
2.0,The stone is pretty but the metal bends so easily.  I need to reshape it each time I put them on!
2.0,"The watch itself is nice enough, but the battery was dead when it arrived.  Now I have to pay to get a battery put in it before I can give it as a gift.  Kind of a bummer."
2.0,"Lays flat on the neck, not raised at all as the picture might suggest. It's also 3mm, not 4. And closer to 18in long, which also rests differently on the neck. Average chain with somewhat misleading description."
2.0,I love them sooo much but they broke on me instantly and wasn’t able to get refund from them. Was so upset
2.0,Dont get me wrong its super cute but top did not fit me at all even though i sized up. Bottom fit great definitely keeping it. I got a large im a size 36DD.
2.0,"I ordered an XL, it fits like a medium. It way too small.  Other than that, it’s a cute shirt. I gave it to a friend."
2.0,mini mouse ears were broken when we recieved product.  too late to replace so I guess i will have to get creative
2.0,"Was told these were long if I bought plus size,, way way too short for my 6ft .  Very disappointed, can never find Talls that are really tall."
2.0,very light. colors not vivid as in photo
2.0,"I really loved the different colors. Unfortunately, there is a tear on the blue band already. Don't know how long all the bands will last. Blue is one of my favorite color. 😣"
2.0,Would be a 5 star but the little arrows the holes are too small and don't fit on a link for a key chain. The arrows have a tiny tiny hole so there is no use for them. All the feathers have a PERFECT hole to fit into a loop. I would buy these again if it was ONLY the feathers. Sturdy and good quality other than that one issue. Came in good packaging.
2.0,"It makes you look old. Length is too long.<br />Should order xs for 5'2"". 115-117lbs. 34A bras size. 25"" waist"
2.0,"I tried on the first shirt and immediately asked for a return. The fit was fine, but the fabric was very cheap feeling. I also saw a number of loose threads in the seams of the one shirt I tried on"
2.0,HAND WASH??? Why would clothes for youth boys be HAND WASH????
2.0,"Do Not fit properly in the frames, wiggle around and comes out while I am cleaning them"
2.0,Thought it was a one piece swim suit it more of a dress not a swim suit so disappointed. There are no bottoms with it
2.0,wasnt the quality of the black dress and it does not fit below the knee as described. 5'7 140 ordered the XL and it didnt fit like it should.
2.0,"Okay quality, some of the stitching seemed to be poorly done though. It runs sooooo small though! I usually wear a medium or large.. I figured better too big than to small so I ordered the XL and I could barely get into it. Sizing is extremely off"
2.0,very cheap feeling fabric
2.0,Too small to fit in a regular persons nose. But the idea is cute
2.0,"This dress is did not fit as expected, it’s too small, my usual medium, but completely different fit, so buyers beware."
2.0,I can’t really give a good review on these because one slipper was larger than the other so I had to return them. I’m sure that this was just a defect in manufacturing because I’ve ordered from this company before and never had this problem. I was given a prompt refund so it was not a bad experience
2.0,"You get what you pay for with these, cheap shoes. The orange stripe along the sole started wearing off within an hour of being worn for the first time (indoors). And the black coating that looks like the toe/fabric reinforcement started peeling off after about a week of normal wear. Sole is also separating from fabric after about a month and a half of wear. Would not buy again!"
2.0,Wow!  I won't let my wife wear this.  Could not believe how cheap looking it looks<br />My fault.  The picture and the actual product are entirely different.  You get what you pay for
2.0,"Did not come with adhesive or double sided tape. No way to stick this to your face, and no suggestions."
2.0,Broke after one month. Poor quality. Bend easy.
2.0,Cheap quality - Won't last more than a few months after buying. Mine broke at the joints as well as smack down in the middle. Looks great while it lasts though.
2.0,The wrong color was received. 8 l ordered blue and red. black and red stripe was delivered. It seems to fit smaller than previous purchase
2.0,Too small.  Will have to save for the grandkids.
2.0,Did not like....
2.0,I have never received something from amazon with such a horrific BO smell. I tried it on but the smell was So bad I didn’t even zip it. It looks a bit too big from the 6 seconds I had it on and I immediately threw it in wash. Hopefully it fits (and smell is gone) when I get it out of washer. Looks cute and decent quality but very disappointed in the nasty used product that was sent.
2.0,Sized small. But a cute shirt
2.0,"The top's fabric does not match the seller's photo. I was expecting a cotton t-shirt but it ended up as nylon material like swimwear type. I'm not sure how my son will feel about the top having that cool feeling to the skin vs a cotton t-shirt. Aside from the fabric, the sleeves are billowy, as in way too wide cut on the sleeves which makes it look ill-fitting. Don't know why it would be so large. It's not like they have huge biceps. The only good part is the image. So still debating to keep or return."
2.0,"The necklace came with most of the beads off. I put them on with my jewelry repair kit. The medal attachments were not tightened.  I hate to keep sending things back, it is inconvenient.  I can't recommend  this one. Necklace is pretty and looks more expensive than it is."
2.0,No me agrado la talla
2.0,"Was nice while it lasted, which was only 3 months. Broke with normal use and regular weather."
2.0,"A nice, easy dress yet it came ripped at the seam."
2.0,"Thses pants were just ok.... very thin material, you can see through them"
2.0,Only used one suitcase and it the wheel fell off at the airport before I had even checked in.  Not a good product
2.0,I didn't like it it hurt my ears to much and the bar was way too big it stretched my cartilage hold so I had to take it out 😞😞
2.0,They were not so pink
2.0,The shirt doesn’t really look like the picture. It is nice  but disappointed that the sleeves are more blue camo than grey camo.
2.0,"Skirt is &#34;open in the front&#34; (couldn't see that in the photo). The way it falls open, it causes the skirt to billow out & lose its sleekness. Going to try to return."
2.0,"I love the style of the tennis bracelet but, it kinks up really bad & doesn't hold its shape. Not happy :("
2.0,"Cheaply made and the skirt is for little kids, it fit my 4 year old."
2.0,This top was too big and the bottoms too small. I got a medium and I am 5’ 7 and 155. The top was so loose it would stay on me. But it would probably fit better if you were a bigger size cup I am A. It was skimpier than I like as well.
2.0,"Disappointed w shirt. It's alot cuter online. Wouldn't repurchased, and I won't be recommending. The color is off and the fit isn't flattering."
2.0,No good for me
2.0,"The shirt is beautifully designed except for the fact that the sizing is off. I am between 135 to 138lbs and 5ft 3in, and bought a medium and it was baggy. I was expecting a more slim fit instead of a loose fit. This medium fits more like a large."
2.0,"I bought this for my guy, one of his xmas gifts. The image on Amazon does not show the material is satiny looking and the sleeves are flared. Is this t-neck for women?"
2.0,Poor quality. Not as shown in the picture above and very thin.
2.0,Bulky and hard to maneuver button pressing.
2.0,"These are an average set of tanks with thinner weight material. I'm 5'2&#34;, 103 lbs with a 30&#34; bust and got the Medium because I'm not a fan of ultra tight. These were just too baggy and I don't think they'll shrink up enough even in the wash to fit properly. The straps felt too wide in the front, and the cut is not scooped enough under the arms to be comfortable. I did receive 12 unique colors though!"
2.0,Material feels cheap- the buttons especially. They feel like those plastic “gold” coins children play with. It’s cute but for the price I wanted a better product.
2.0,These are very small...bought the same size in other shirts and they fit very well but the tank tops run small buy 2sizes bigger if you want them
2.0,"This is just huge on me. I’m 5’4”, just about covers my ankles. It should be shown on a model! The reviews said it ran small. Ordered a Med. I’m  a 73yr. old women &amp; wear a size 8. I missed the return date by eight days. May I still return or at least get a size Small? Thank You in advance! I’m giving 2 stars as it’s very warm, but too big &amp; heavy to use as a robe."
2.0,Pants are too baggy jacket fits ok
2.0,"I wanted these because of the lovely blue/purple color. What I received (as a gift) was clear crystal. Looks like glass. Just not at all what I was expecting. I see that they are now out of this product. Perhaps it was a 'replacement' or 'substitution' they made but the bottom line is that it was ordered as the blue/purple color but what arrived was clear, glass-looking. Returning. Sad."
2.0,Ripped on initial donning.
2.0,Loses goldplate after a day.
2.0,A $2.00 hat with a $1.00 decal. Would not buy again
2.0,The quality and color of this print is not great. Also it is 100% cotton so it will shrink. And the title says long sleeve but it is a short sleeve shirt. Wouldn't recommend this product.
2.0,"The bag looked nice and had a very good size for a sketchbook 5x8, pencils set, cell-phone, and different little things.<br />However, the quality was very poor. Black color was washed out after I cleaned the bag in warm water with soap. Seams were not performed accurately. Zipper got broken in less than a year. The button fell off in a few months."
2.0,The bracelets I got have faded and am not sure if they help for healing. I don’t believe there real Copper.
2.0,"Design was very cool, but the quality of the sweatshirt used was not acceptable. Very thin fabric... I sent it back for a refund"
2.0,The string on the sleeves don't fit as shown. Really disappointed with the fit.
2.0,The only reason this is getting two stars is because it was covered in brown dust and smelled horrible when I got it. I washed it thoroughly and NOW it's a cute dress.
2.0,Material is poor quality and approx 2-3 size to small
2.0,I found molding flash all along the inside of the area tht contacts the face and nose portion of the eye piece if you place it over the right eye.<br />I tried sanding and filing it smooth but it really didn't help much.
2.0,I had to glue jewels back on
2.0,Very pretty but the clips do not hold it on at all
2.0,I wish it would have fit because it is really cute.  However the shoulders and sleeves were WAY too tight for me to wear.
2.0,Nice cap but after about a month of on and off wear it is leaving fuzz balls on my husbands bald head when he takes it off.
2.0,Sizes run small. Needed to order a larger size.
2.0,Zipper broke immediately.  Super cheap zipper and the arms arent cloth they're like a sheer liner on the inside
2.0,"It it sized smaller than advertised. The material is very thin, it's not something I would but again."
2.0,"I don’t like it AT ALL!  I returned w/in the same hour.  It’s made 4 an older woman (Grandma).  It’s tight fitting, & heavy.  I’m 5 feet even & weigh 143lbs, so I have some hips (not huge tho).  It’s not flowing like the pic, there’s NO GIVE, bcuz it’s polyester (I believe). I need CHIFFON 4 a good flow 4 beach. Someone may like it tho.  The only good thing are the colors are pretty."
2.0,"While the earrings are beautiful, they are very heavy and caused my ears to ache after only a few minutes. In the picture shown on the site, they don't seem as big as they actually are. Nor heavy. I would sugest including a weight in the description to better inform buyers."
2.0,The quality and fit are fine but I guess I didn't realize this was like a racer back like you find on women's clothing. It feels really weird and looks feminine to me. It pulls everything to a point in the middle of your upper back where there exists a tight spot. Style aside its decent.
2.0,"Slightly see through and didn't feel confident wearing it. I'm a 5'2"" 200lb person and white just isn't my style. Wear with caution"
2.0,xlarge is more like a large.
2.0,The dress was much shorter than shown on the picture.
2.0,I’m 5’5” and this was way too short for me. The lining is about 2” shorter than the chiffon and it only just covered my butt standing still. I also found the elastic waist to be too tight for me. I returned this dress.
2.0,"These are not neon blue in color.  It is more of a teal.  Disappointed in the misrepresentation in color.  Tie dye, one would expect variance in design and maybe some color variance.  But I would not call this neon blue"
2.0,Disappointed for it came broken and cannot be fixed. A peice of the metal around the pendant was missing but hope no one will notice it when I wear it
2.0,The gold finish rubbed off onto my fingers the first day I wore them.
2.0,The size is small compared to other brands.
2.0,the way it was described ...these socks should have fitted a women foot..but you should have small feet for them to really fit well...if your size is over a 7..they might be annoying to wear
2.0,"The shirt is very cute, but since it ran super small, I had to return."
2.0,"I ordered this purse and had many compliments. My daughter had one also. We were very disappointed in the qualiry however. The metal hardware on both our purses not just one, but both came apart in less than a month. I am sad too because I like cr the purse. Never really got to use it!!!"
2.0,The color was what I liked best. It’s small and has a weird extra hole towards the top. Contacted the seller and I guess that’s the way it’s supposed to be. I don’t like how that wasn’t pictured in the actual pictures posted. It’s a cheap necklace overall.
2.0,Very low quality. Looks like someone tried to create the HNIC logo in Microsoft Paint and then slapped it on a hat.
2.0,"Broke after 2 weeks of normal wear... the clasp was weak and broke off after 2 weeks of daily wear.  The value of the watch was not achieved, now I have to buy a band which costs more than the watch is probably worth."
2.0,"So i read the previous reviews on how sizing is small, so i orders 2X and I usually wear Large... This shirt is basically a small.. skin tight - for me to wear it i would have to become a skeleton. I will probably give this away."
2.0,"If you are prone to ear lobe infections and are using these as a stretching kit, I highly advise against it. Save yourself the puffy nasty ears that I had.<br />These are for absolutely healed ears, and even then, make sure you clean them twice a day with saline. The only reason I give these two stars is that there weren't any missing pieces and they do look nice for plastic.."
2.0,I did not receive the necklace that was pictured. This is a howling wolf’s head not the full bodied wolf standing on a mountain. I was really looking forward to receiving the correct item. This is nice but it’s not what I ordered.
2.0,Try to put these on my original M frames the noise pieces does not fit and the lenses are not cut to fit m frame V1
2.0,"Looks nothing like the photo, flares up and out in the back. Sent back for a refund."
2.0,I remember the days when the hoodies used to be thick and would fit right now they're thin as paper and come a little bit big... kind of disappointed in Russell when I just bought them a year and a half ago and was happy with the product they were putting out
2.0,"Super cute suit, but even though I ordered the larger size and followed the ordering instructions, it was way too small in the bust.  The suit fit well elsewhere, and was flattering for my shape, but it isn't scaled appropriately in the chest-- bigger girls have bigger chests!  This suit assumes that someone wearing size 16/18 would have around a 34A top.  Disappointing.  I returned it."
2.0,The unicorn doesn't have feet. It didn't take long for the shoe to fall apart.
2.0,"Got these and thought they had screen protector but they do not. Didn't like the look it gave my watch. They made it look cheap,"
2.0,For some unknown reason they put velcro in this belt.  The only purpose it serves is to make it harder for the belt to slide around your waste.  My other Bison belts didn't have this.  They should call this one the bicep belt because you are going to get a workout yanking this one around your waste.  The velcro prevents the ability to fine tighten the belt as do from time to time.  Instead you have to undo the belt and yank it through the loop again.
2.0,"The bra itself is good, it's the straps! I didn't know it was just a strip of elastic, which irritates my skin...."
2.0,"TL;DR: 2 out of 3 pairs were too small to work for me. They're probably better suited for cartilage piercings. I'll update my review if I'm ever able to wear them. I'm giving 2 stars because the pictures show they can be worn in the earlobes and it just didn't happen.<br /><br />I ordered these earrings because I enjoy simple jewelry and wanted small hoops to put in my earlobe piercings and rarely take out. Unfortunately, I couldn't get these in. The hoops are so small that they were slightly misshapen by the time I opened them enough to get them into the hole.<br /><br />But that didn't matter because I couldn't get them closed. The small and medium sizes with the ball closures were so small that I couldn't see around my hand in the mirror to close them. I could probably leave them in without closing them, although that's not ideal.<br /><br />The other closure was difficult due to the size, too. Once the smallest hoop was in my ear, I couldn't close it enough to get it to connect. It didn't help that the wire could barely fit itself through the closure hole.<br /><br />I assume these will work better if you want to use them for a cartilage piercing or the nose since those are thinner parts of the body (for me, at least). Everyone is different, so these just might work for your earlobes. I'm not so lucky.<br /><br />I don't recommend these for tender piercings. I have a piercing that's still tender after having it for 1.5 years (piercing gone wrong, I suppose), so I don't wear anything but a stud in it. That's why I wanted simple, tiny hoops. I get tired of the same thing. As I tried to put it in my ear, it HURT so bad. That's not completely the fault of the these earrings; I probably shouldn't be forcing a piercing where it hurts in the first place. However, one of the earrings had a jagged piece on the end that hurt like crazy and made my piercing bleed. It doesn't take much for it to bleed since it's a bad piercing, though. I don't totally blame the earring for that incident.<br /><br />The largest size of these earrings worked just fine for me. I'm bummed I couldn't get the smaller sizes to work.<br /><br />PROS:<br />- 2 styles and 3 sizes come in the package.<br />- All the earrings come in little bags inside a small pouch with a cleaning cloth.<br />- The closures work well.<br /><br />CONS:<br />- The small and medium sizes were too small to fit my earlobe piercings.<br />- One of the earrings had a jagged edge.<br />- The small/medium earrings ended up slightly misshapen once I finally had them open enough to fit around my earlobe. (I tried my best to prevent that from happening.)"
2.0,"Not midi length. I'm tall, so expected it to fit shorter than for someone of typical height, but it was SHORT! Usually midi length on everyone else means knee length for me, but this was well above knee. Also runs small in the arms. But the worst part, was it STUNK! So bad 🤢"
2.0,Purchased size SMALL and the sleeves are big enough to fit a professional bodybuilder ... With room to spare.  Returned.
2.0,"As soon as my septum started to bother me I removed the jewelry as I could only imagine it was staining green as cheap jewelry does. Didn't last a month, also my septum was pierced perfectly and this piece of jewelry hangs really low, not as snug as I had hoped for. It covered my medusa awkwardly. So much hope but it fell short..."
2.0,"I ordered my normal size but this is tight all over. The sleeves are tight and the neck line is too scooped for me, I don't like the lower cut."
2.0,"Very nice sandal, but the stitching was subpar and it fell apart quickly."
2.0,"The first one I bought came and was too big (I ordered a M and received a 2XL).  I didn't love it, but thought it would be better if I got it in the right size, so I sent it back for the correct size.  I received the correct size and it just doesn't fit well.  I bought this as a maternity sun shirt but this shirt particularly makes me feel like a giant bleu whale.  The cut on the neck and arms is not nearly as cute or flattering as the model.  The arms are too long and the shirt just fits odd and I'm certain it's not because I'm pregnant.  I should have returned, but I missed the return window."
2.0,Bought a large which is my normal size and started to try it on and couldn’t but I past my chest which is very small. It ripped in the middle immediately. I had high hopes because it looked beautiful out of the package but very disappointed in the fit.
2.0,"Cute as hell, small and nearly unusable, as sturdy as any item that is less then $5 should be. Don't waste your money"
2.0,"Ordered two of these for granddaughters...One garnet, one amethyst....don't bother with the amethyst, couldn't tell the color even after taking into the bright sunshine.  The garnet was better but not 'over the top.' I did like the stainless steel but the stones I ordered were very disappointing."
2.0,Cheap feeling and very heavy
2.0,"Soft and comfy, but was at too loose, no support"
2.0,"Jacket fits at least 2 sizes larger than it should. Buttons are barely attached. I've owned the jacket for 1 month and is already missing buttons. I would not recommend this jacket for quality or durability. If you do order, size down."
2.0,I wanted to love this. The skirt underneath was too short. I won't be able to wear this. I hate that because I was looking forward to wearing this skirt.  Usually a Large would fit me fine for skirts. I have Mediums that fit me just fine too.
2.0,"I do not recommend this pruse .I have used this purse for two months and the handle broke, I haven't over packed it , you would think that with the bag this big the handles would last a longer. I love the size ( it is a bit big for my taste) and color however I except my purse to last at least a year."
2.0,Bought a size larger than I typically wear and it was STILL way too small.
2.0,Too high and tight for the child to put on them self and parent
2.0,Fell apart the first month
2.0,"Sadly, these were toooooo tight across the bridge of my nose. No way to tell this when purchasing the glasses, so unless you have a thin nose, these aren't for you."
2.0,I though theses pants were more like sweat pants but there made of thin material like stretchy pants
2.0,"One for the money - but not two for show!  This watch is just cheap. I've purchased my share of inexpensive, quality watches - at this very price point and been completely impressed with every watch. This ""time"" I ""paid for what I got"". It's pretty to look at - that's where the affair stopped immediately. The bracelet is just a cheap piece - flimsy, doesn't closes off-center and not completely secure - they tried way too hard in the gold color as it looks very much like a ""bleach blonde"" front the Eighties!  The main party of the watch is not bad - but that's all I have to say about this watch. This only handful of purchases I've made through this online retailer that I truly regret. $33.00 or $3300 it's all relative when the manufacturer didn't even try to make a decent prefer. Sorry Megir - take this off the shelf until you can figure out a more quality driven manufacturer. Good luck all. God's best."
2.0,Really small - ordered a large and it was closer to a kid's large 😳
2.0,I wear a men's 8.5 and the medium were too big.
2.0,The clasp was defective and now I have no necklace. My sister got it for me after the birth of my first grandchild and now its gone. Ugh.
2.0,This item was well packaged and came in a nice box however there was a scratch on the upper  right corner of the wallet. Since the package wasn’t damaged it seems like the item came straight from the manufacturer with these scratches. I’m disappointed and considering returning the item as I intended it to be a gift.
2.0,"This cover-up is gigantic.  I understand it is one size fits all, but being 125ish pounds, I was lost in all the extra fabric.  The color is really pretty, but it definitely does not fit like it does on the model in the picture.  I had to return this."
2.0,Although adjustable- it doesnt adjust and fit well
2.0,"These are super, super cute, but not really compression, feels like maybe 5 mmHG, so if you want something kind of compression, but still cute, these are for you!"
2.0,Pretty except for the dark spot o. The stone.
2.0,the color was yellow no tan
2.0,Lost a stone within the day. Well I guess you get what you paid for right....
2.0,They are too tiny.
2.0,"Has a weird shape to it that is unflattering to me. Soft material that lays down heavy and creates a pleated pouch in the belly area which enhances any chub in the belly area or adds chub if you don’t have any. I kept it for some reason, but never wear it. I really wanted to like this blouse. The wine/red is exactly the color I love, but all in all, it does not work for me."
2.0,The material is cheap and the cuts are uneven and fits oddly
2.0,Material is the best. After the 2nd time it had ripped on the back
2.0,The design and print on shirt I like but i return this shirt along with others from same manufacture because of the material. The material had a shine or metallic look that I didn’t like.
2.0,Don't like the fabric - way too synthetic.
2.0,"[[VIDEOID:aed234b3d8c64cca4c37c4705c5f8b44]] I was worried that this would not be long enough, as I wanted it to sit above my waist. I ordered two sizes up since the reviews said they were small. I saw that the length of the XL was 44 inches. I measured it on myself and decided to try and order it thinking that it would suffice. I waited a week to get the item only to discover that it was WAY too short and it was only 37 inches long... Not 44 like the description said. It does fit around me just fine, and it is the color I wanted... But it is disappointingly short."
2.0,"when ordering this, go to the next larger size"
2.0,Material is way too light weight. Too short for a size M.
2.0,"They were extremely small. Ended up giving them to my daughter that wears a small and they fit her perfectly. Disappointed, definitely not the size it said they were"
2.0,So out of all the witch costumes my daughter picked this one. I read the reviews and decided to go with it. When it arrived I was like what in the world. It was literally vacuumed sealed. I thought we’ll maybe it will still be cute and I cut it open. The broom is complete junk. It definitely does not look like the photo. And the hat is this plastic material that has a plastic bow around it. I am so disappointed in this costume!  I wanted to send it back but I opened it and I figured Amazon would not accept it. So it is what it is!
2.0,Very big and doesn’t stay up the top Is constantly falling down for the price it’s a waste
2.0,These looked nice but broke within days. Unimpressed.
2.0,Me agradó mucho
2.0,"Super cute dress, however sizing not accurate ."
2.0,Works okay. Not the results I was hoping for.
2.0,"It fit horribly.  The torso is incredibly large, so unless you're super busty don't count on this fitting well.  The fabric was really soft, but that was the only thing I liked.  I even tried to share it with two friends with very different body shapes and it didn't work for them either."
2.0,I was excited to try something new and add a bit of spice to my wardrobe. These were extremely cheaply made. One of them had its clasp fall off when I was taking them off the package. The clasps are simply held on with super/hot glue and the choker itself is pretty scratchy on your skin. The velvet should be on both sides for the wearers comfort.
2.0,"I have the Trader Joe's white and blue bag and absolutely love it. I thought this would be similar in quality and size but it's not... This bag is thinner, floppier, and not nearly as big.<br /><br />Cute design... But for the extra couple bucks, buy the white and blue bag. It's much better quality. I will be returning this one."
2.0,They are well made and the design is as pictured. I got them for my husband. He wears an 11. They did not fit. These are definitely for a boy.
2.0,"Although they are beautiful, the pockets started unraveling after a couple of uses. They are also a little see through."
2.0,I loved this outfit for my daughter she looked cute in it but it has really bad stitching picture doesn't do justice to how bad it is
2.0,The camo on the band looks like a bad screen printing with everything blending together.
2.0,Fit was as expected except for the length.  Much too long...completely covered my feet.  Returning.
2.0,"Uhh... Well the material looks kinda weird which could be cool, but it doesn't feel good. It's itchy. They didn't really do tummy control like the listing claims. There's just an extra elastic band floating around in the waist band. The material is too stretchy to really give any lifting. The blue color is very pretty but overall I'm not impressed."
2.0,Great cut but the color and fabric are really not up to par.  I returned it but will look out for something similar in a higher quality.
2.0,"Works well, never dropped a card. Scratched them up though."
2.0,The forehead part is sooo tall!!! It popped up inches above where our heads stopped and we looked like Coneheads. I cut it with scissors but that was super hard to maneuver and left scratch marks around other parts. Thick plastic though...
2.0,"The stone was nice, but the picture made the ring appear bigger and more of a statement piece of jewelry.  Not...it was a fail.  So I was disappointed.  It did not meet my expectations."
2.0,"Very very long even for me and I am 5'8&#34;<br />And they do not stay up during warm ups.  If I didn't have dancers legs and was maybe 3x my size they might fit but I dont plan on gaining 200lbs just to fit into these.  I wanted to return them but the cost to return them was higher than what they cost to begin with.  Awful product, do not buy."
2.0,"I ordered 2 of these...one green and one red, both XXL. I usuall wear XL but I read that they run small. They definitely do. Also, for some reason, the red is overwhelmingly smaller than the green even though I ordered the same size...the green is definitely smaller than an XXL; I never wear that size. They arrived in the same shipment but were packaged differently. The material seems dressy and luckily at least one fit relatively well. The red will be returned."
2.0,"The dress should be super cute.<br />But the cut of the dress just doesn't look right in real life.<br /><br />The waist didn't seem shaped right and that little poof in the shoulders was crazy big.<br />Not cute at all, very goofy looking.<br /><br />Materials were ok though, in both quality and color.<br />Maybe the slim figured version looks good."
2.0,Runs small and loner is very short
2.0,"The box itself is nice and the etched glass came out good, but the box isn't as wide as I would have expected.  If you have Invicta watches this box is not good for you."
2.0,The shirt looked unfinished.  Was not happy
2.0,"Picture shows one style of pants, you receive another. Very very VERY thin material. They won't last long if you wear them on a day to day basis"
2.0,"I purchased these in black.  The finish is a matte-style, which was not evident from the picture or description.  Nine West pumps are my go-to shoes for the office, but the finish on these will keep them from being a repeat purchase."
2.0,"This product is getting two stars because it is not at all as advertised. I thought I was going to get a short dress with pockets. I received a long maxi dress that is cotton and has no pockets. The print and color is similar, however, it is a completely different dress.<br />However, I very much do like the dress I received. It is also Roxy and was an XS. That is the only reason I'm giving this two instead of one star."
2.0,I couldn't use it for my purposes. I attached this to the zipper on my wallet and would hold elephant to open close zipper. But the chain is not sturdy and came apart within a few days of use. The figure is also pretty small (about the size of one of my fingernails).
2.0,Not for me ... didn’t lay flat but maybe it is meant for a smaller person.
2.0,"Material is very soft, nicely padded. Looks like it would be very comfortable but waaaayyy too small. I’m a 38DDD which is what I ordered but I sadly had to send it back, I couldn’t even get the hooks half way around me!"
2.0,This item fits very small. I suggest going up a size for this one.
2.0,"Pros:<br />The material of this shirt is very flowy and stretchy. My husband liked the fit of it very well. We got him a small.<br /><br />Cons:<br />Color was wayyyyyyy off from the picture on Amazon.<br />There was a missing button and button hole on the right sleeve. (had to roll up his sleeves when we wore the shirt at a wedding)<br /><br />Otherwise, it's a nice dress shirt overall."
2.0,"Looks cheap, feels cheap, is cheap. Very much you get what you pay for. It’s made from a cheap aluminum alloy that feels not unlike a soup can. The band is painted not anodized so the color will chip off very easily. Setting the time so sensitive that I can’t help but feel given the rest of the build quality their manufacturing tolerances and insane gear reduction will lead to losing time quickly. On the other hand, I have no immediate reason to believe the band or the clasp will fail under normal use, it seems adequately made.<br /><br />My old Seiko died and I need a filler watch ASAP to satisfy my watch needs while I shop for my ideal watch, this fills that niche well enough. But don’t rely on it being your go-to watch."
2.0,"Kinda junk.  It almost looks like an engraving, but it's just a lame print under a bubble of glass.  I regret the purchase."
2.0,I wasn't crazy about the colour I thought it was a little bit lighter than the picture the material was a little heavier than I anticipated
2.0,"Half of them broke within the first time trying to put them in. The plastic balls just disintegrate in your fingers as you try to screw them onto the metal. At first I thought maybe I screwed it on too tight, and that's why it crumbled, but trying 3 rings later, I have come to the conclusion that these are CHEAPCHEAPCHEAP. But you get what you pay for so whatever. 1 week after delivery, out of 25, I still have 8 wearable that the plastic didn't crumble in my fingers."
2.0,"One shoulder seam is apparently shorter. Makes it uncomfortable. Returning. As someone who sews, this is unacceptable."
2.0,"This romper has so much potential. The fabric is thin & perfect for hot weather here in Florida. The romper is short & I’m only 5’3”. My butt cheeks are about to make an appearance if I take a step. The top part is baggy & my ta-ta’s are a 34DD. I do like to let my girls hang free. I think even with a bra it wouldn’t fit properly. The straps are adjustable which I like, but they are put together with a tiny piece of cheap plastic which already broke as seen in the pictures. The print is pretty & if it was made better it could have been so cute!<br /><br />I am 5,3” - 34DD - 140lbs - For reference."
2.0,I really wanted to like but i disliked the material not what I expected. In my opinion too itchy for my  sensitive skin.  Unfortunately I did return but customer service was excellent when I went ahead and returned item.
2.0,Doesn’t compress like I had hoped.
2.0,"This dress came ontime and the fabric is nice and soft however the dress fits small not as expected as I am a medium, I received the medium and I cannot button up the chest I should have ordered the large."
2.0,Narrow toe space
2.0,This hat was very shallow. Did not stay on my toddler's head. 'Z' Sticker was poor quality.
2.0,Comfy material but kind of tight and makes you accentuates your trouble upper parts
2.0,These are very cheap looking. I had to immediately throw away two of the four rings the day I received them because they looked so bad. The other two are okay. I gave 2 stars instead of 1 because I'm not surprised I got what I paid for. They were cheap in price and quality.
2.0,"I’m 5’5 and 117. Petite frame. I generally wear small. I heard it was a bit big so I figured a small would be a cute, slouchy fit. It was enormous. I could literally fit two of me in it. I think it may have actually been wider than it was long. I could put it on and pull the center buttons over to the other side of my waist without stretching the fabric at all. I tried belting it for a better fit. There was so much extra fabric, it started bunching and looked horrible. I can’t wear it out. It’s not a bad house dress/nightgown though. Its comfy and I’ll wear it around my home."
2.0,I don't like nothing about this watch band. Hot cheep made.
2.0,Way tooooo small.
2.0,Cheap broke soon as I opened the back side
2.0,Does NOT do what it says.  It does not have real support and adhesive is short lived.  Shape created (tried several ways) doesn’t look natural.  Waste of money!
2.0,They were too big and heavy for my ears but looks great when I attach them to my UGG boots
2.0,"Ordered an XL, gave it to a friend who wears a XS."
2.0,"Cool hat, way too small for me. Poor stitching"
2.0,I do not recommend these socks for people with wide feet they do not stretch.
2.0,Crooked sandals. Don't align right to the foot.
2.0,Much smaller than what I expected. I know the measurements are there but it would be a lot more helpful to show the necklace on a person or a mannequin.
2.0,I had to return it. I thought it was an actually wrap dress but instead it is a faux wrap/surplice bodice only. It didn't hit right on the body and felt off. Might work for others I just didn't like it enough to keep it.
2.0,You can see through the dress pretty well. Very thin and wrinkles easily.
2.0,I wanted to love this swimsuit but the fabric was sewn badly. The edges of the fabric kept rolling in on themselves.  The left strap did not line up where it was sewn together causing it to have a twist midway up the strap which didnt look good and was not comfortable at all.<br />There is also no push up about this top.
2.0,"It fit great and was perfect for the chillier mornings, but it looked terrible after the first wash. I washed it with my delicates in cold water and air dried, but the black on the pants just looked liked it had been washed many times, after just one wash. But I also purchased in blue, and that color still looks good after 3 washes."
2.0,"Horribly made, the cement can be seen oozing out of jems' seat. The earnings look as if someone was in a rush and had something else to do. The earnings can't be worn without the flaws being noticed by even a glance."
2.0,Oh no<br />Fits like a costume
2.0,Got the ring.. but the metal had been worn off. But tbh— it looks aged and still like it so I’m keeping it.
2.0,It is a boxy t-shirt with a pattern cut out of the back.
2.0,Only giving it 2 because of the size. Looks and feels nice.  I ordered in the xxxl knowing that it would run small. I'm 5&#34;3 and about 215 thick and curvy with large breasts. This barely covers your boobs but does have a fitted waist. Do not order this if you have a long torso bc it's super short and you'll have a major wedgie ! Not cute. I'm returning this product bc it's like super small! Asian sizes I guess.
2.0,I’ve had this watch band for a little over three months and the pin has fallen out twice. The pin fell out once a month ago and just again today. When the pin falls out my watch drops off my wrist. This could cause my watch to break.
2.0,In spite of their statement that the luggage is almost indestructible it didn't withstand even one trip overseas. So the larger piece goes to trash. I wouldn't recommend this set to anybody.
2.0,"This would have been cute but the arms were just too tight. I don’t have large arms either, I got the medium and my biceps might be 10-11” around and the arms for just too tight."
2.0,What's up with the prices of slippers???  These fit true to size but a kind if obviously cheaply made.  Several sequins were off in the package before we opened it.  My granddaughter loved them so all was right with the world!
2.0,"They are very pretty and I love wearing them, but they're not very durable. 1 of the chains already broke. I guess for the price I paid it's to be expected 😐😒"
2.0,One snap doesn’t snap together and very see through. Would not buy again.
2.0,"Yuck.  Not very comfortable at all.  I tried one pair and donated the rest to the Women's Shelter.  Much better and much more comfortable underwear out there, skip these"
2.0,I took a large which didn't fit well. I should have stuck to my original size which is medium.
2.0,If you are petite I would not consider ordering this shirt. I ended up donating shirt without ever wearing it.
2.0,I ordered one size up and the dress was still too small. It is extremely short as well. Nice colors though
2.0,I suggest ordering a size larger.
2.0,"Citw shirt, but didn't realize until after I gifted it to my friend, who is a sign language interpreter, that the ""b"" sign is missing the index finger... I'm super bummed."
2.0,Dress fits good but it’s way too short. I’m 5’ 6” and it barely came to my ankles. I ordered the XL. I recommend this dress if you’re like 5’ 2” at the most or you don’t mind it being above your ankles.
2.0,It bunched up uncomfortably around my waist and the zipper buckled up front when I was seated. Maybe the bra version is better.
2.0,"It's really square and stiff, wore for a few hours and took it off as I felt the quality was just really sub-par to the name brand."
2.0,"My husband initially liked the belt since it was a good looking belt and comfortable, but the ratchet buckle broke after wearing the belt for a couple of weeks. Since it came with no instructions, he had no idea how to get the buckle to release, he worked for ten minutes trying to get the belt to release. We have learned that you get what you pay for. We ordered another ratchet dress belt from Ryser's Belt Inc. which came with instructions on how to cut the belt to the correct size and also how to release the buckle in the event that it became locked."
2.0,Looked to much like a bath robe when on so I returned it.
2.0,The material is very thin and cheap feel. Shipping use 13 days and the seller never reply. Waste money.
2.0,"These arrived and were not as excepted, stated that they were comfortable...nope not at all."
2.0,I wish I would have read the customer reviews.  The picture and description is very misleading.  I wouldn't have spent 5.99 on ONE bracelet. I was buying this for some of my ADHD students. ... oh well
2.0,Straps are not adjustable and the arm pit whole is large enough to show full side of my bra and part of my ribs.
2.0,"These are NOT 10 gauge. The sizing is completely off. I measured these and they are actually 4mm, or 6g. That's two full gauge sizes' difference. Completely unacceptable to market these as 10g, and totally unsafe to try to put these in 10g piercings.<br /><br />I didn't accidentally order or receive the wrong ones, either; the plastic baggie they came in clearly said &#34;10g&#34;.<br /><br />They are, however, very nice 6g eyelets."
2.0,"The Pom looks nothing like the photo, I am comparing next to another one I received.  The hat is nice, but if you are expecting a nice fluffy large Pom, don’t purchase this one"
2.0,I didn’t like that it was just the top no bottoms
2.0,"The advertising was wrong, this wallet is not leather.  I was very disappointed.  I feel mislead, and sad.  I will use it for now as I really need this but very disappointed."
2.0,"Not a big fan, for the price it’s decent if you just want a bangle. But it’s not jade and appears like murky stone. Also it’s quite thick"
2.0,I loved these belts as long as they lasted. They have broken as the pins that hold the hinge together have fallen out. Quite disappointing.
2.0,"After measuring current glasses twice before ordering and as instructed, these glasses arrived and they are for men not women. I ordered small and they should have fit but are too wide in two places. This is the type of thing that is happening more and more on Amazon. Things are advertised one way but the product arrives another. Disappointing."
2.0,"Usually i get large , but this one is too large than expected"
2.0,"I normally teeter between a medium and a large, but I saw other reviews about tight tops so I got a large. It is HUGE. Good for a super relaxing at home dress, but it’s too big to really work for other stuff. And for reference I’m a bottom heavy athletic 160lbs, 5’7."
2.0,"This shirt runs very small,and there was no label in it"
2.0,"Others have mentioned the weight, and I didn't think much of it.  This thing is HEAVY!  The Charge 2 is a lot lighter than the Charge HR that it is replacing, to add that much weight makes no sense.  I wanted to dress up the band, not add wrist weights to work out during the day.  As a comparison, the band alone (no Charge attached) is heavier than my entire Rolex GMT Master and band, and I consider the Rolex a heavy watch.  I am keeping the Baylite leather band, and returning this to Amazon."
2.0,The color is brown not black it’s doesn’t look as the picture
2.0,Quality was not as I expected.  Cheap and to small.  I am normally a large but ordered an xlarge and it was small like a medium.
2.0,"The fit was right but the band and underwire was very narrow and I have some &#34;extra to love&#34; under my arms so while it technically fit, I felt like I LOOKED like a popped biscuit because of the weird narrowness of the underwire and thin straps. Almost as if the underwire was placed for a smaller cup size or more front facing chests.But three kids later it was just strange. I returned before washing so I have no clue how long they would last but seemed fairly well made otherwise."
2.0,"Great hoodie. Good material and comfortable, but the pocket ripped after only 2 months. Got a good amount of use, but defintely not worth the price. I'll be fixing the rip, but I shouldn't have to. If it didn't rip, it'd be 5 stars."
2.0,"Kinda cheap quality, but worth what you pay. It’s so small, I have to return it."
2.0,The pattern was very blurry and the fit was baggy.
2.0,Got these for my septum and was unable to latch it close .. I'm sure one is capable of closing it but its very difficult. Even with gloves.
2.0,I’m 167 pounds . The outfit was perfect until i spotted two holes in the sides . I’m very upset because i really wanted to wear this. It’s a medium & it fits like a small . Refund please
2.0,"You get what you pay for with these. The sunglasses. I bought them just to have an extra pair of glasses in my car in case I forget mine or a friend needs a pair. I thought this would be a great, cheap back up pair that I wouldn't have to worry about. Well, they are terrible. I can't wear them for more than a couple of minutes.<br /><br />First of all, the sides of the glasses where the plastic starts, gets caught in my hair. I was wearing a pony tail when I first put these on and it pulled on my hair and I had to re-do my hair.<br /><br />Second, I walked outside for only a couple of minutes and the mirrored glasses are almost impossible to see out of. I had my hands full and was carrying my daughter and I was pretty much blind. The sun was really bright but I had to take off my sunglasses so that I could see what I was doing.<br /><br />Third, the dark lens glasses are not anti glare. They are not as bad as the mirrored lenses which are pretty much garbage since I can't see out of them. I tried to wear these on a walk around my neighborhood and I ended up just walking without sunglasses.<br /><br />The only good thing these would be good for is maybe a Halloween costume. These are not functional as sunglasses."
2.0,"I ordered same top in two prints.  This grey and yellow is very pretty however, the sleeves are not made correctly, or as pictures, and they are far too small for an XXL top.  The other top, on same order top fits great.<br />I do like the fabric of this top and since I was in the middle of moving when I ordered, I am outside the return window now and I will have to figure out something for the sleeves.  I will probably order more tops but will definitely try on when first received, and double check that the sleeves are made correctly."
2.0,"I received this bag without its rain fly. The bottom zipper is sticking so bad I have left it opened rather than fight with it, and nowhere that there is two straps are they of a symmetrical length. After washing review videos I had expected more. Disappointed.  ( At least they have a great customer service. I got my return label and refund within 24 hrs . Thanks for that anyway. I'm not sure if it was Amazon who got my money back that fast or mission peak but thanks to whoever."
2.0,"Pensé que la forma de la parte de alante era un poco más ancha, y las tiras sujetadoras son muy débiles."
2.0,"Pretty disappointed in how this hat turned out. First of all, it is possible this hat and my head just aren’t a good match. What I found, however, is that the opening in the back was cut much larger than any other hat I’ve ever worn, making it look pretty silly when worn backwards due to the amount of head/hair visible (see photos). Also, the adjustment strap is completely visible under the material that it tucks into, which to me also looks silly, not to mention a little cheap. I have another dri fit hat from Nike that worked out just fine, so I had high hopes for this particular model hat. However, it came up very short. There won’t be an occasion that I wear it.<br /><br />— Jon"
2.0,Belt broke after 1 week of use.
2.0,"Too heavy, difficult to get card out of the holder"
2.0,Nice coins but i was missing half of my order. I ordered them for Christmas presents for our fire department and it took so long to get here and replacements won’t get here on time.
2.0,The belt buckle latch is constantly slipping so the belt comes loose. I just stopped wearing it after a while. The belt portion is good though. Overall this definitely does not beat the Nexbelt
2.0,Had to return could see my nipples. FYI I have breastfed two babies but my girls are still fine.
2.0,"Though the holder looks very nice, it is a standard card holder that's had felt applied to the inside, which seems nice, but takes up too much space. I can only get 8 or 9 cards in it. I'd just recommend getting a more useful one."
2.0,Disappointed in color and in length of scarf.
2.0,They slide off as soon as I walk 5 feet in my shoes.
2.0,The quality of the fabric as well as the fit are fine.  The issue that I have is that the piping around one sleeve is navy and then the piping around the other sleeve is white.  Looks like there was any oversight during  manufacturing.
2.0,"Not a fan. This just fit strangely. Leg holes are weirdly small, torso is short. The fabric is thin so it feels just.... too exposed."
2.0,Does not fit as expected (too small) may need to order one to two sizes larger. Beautiful dress otherwise.
2.0,Loved this coat but the lining on the inner part of it came apart; had to send it back.
2.0,I had ordered this uniform for our Christmas cantata &#34;Homecoming 1940&#34;. The uniform itself is not bad though the skirt is very big and I had to make it smaller but what was most problematic - there was missing the hat. I wrote immediately to seller and I was assured the piece is coming. It didn't. I had to make my own hat.
2.0,This watch band is actually very pretty and I love the design. It’s also very affordable but with that comes the “you get what you pay for”. The design peels off from the watch band. You won’t get much wear out of this long term as the flowers each slowly peel off. It’s like the design was just applied on top of a clear band with no protection or way to bond permanently to the band itself. I hope they do another production line of this and fix the problem because I do love how pretty it is.
2.0,Too long and large in the bust/neckline
2.0,Kind of looks like a short muumuu maybe if you have no curve it would look a lot nicer
2.0,Ordered two shirts at a value price and rather disappointed. I'm not sure the vendor I ordered from was using licensed ABBA shirts and I can't contact them as their site vanished. The shirts themselves are a heavy material 100% cotton and have no complaints but the silk-screened logo is too low on the shirt as opposed to being higher up over the chest as depicted so it looks strange with the logo more over the belly. The silk-screen itself was too dark and the faces are hard to make out. I don't know if the same type of shirt ordered from another vendor at a higher price would be any better but I'm disappointed with what I got. My recommendation would be to research the vendor and reviews closely if you decide to buy. Thank-you.
2.0,"I bought a similar pair of wayfarers from supposedly the same manufacturer a year ago that were fantastic, so I ordered what I thought were the same thing ... These pair are of very poor quality. As others have said, these are very light weight (almost too much so), but the real problem is the screws! They unscrew themselves every time time you open or close the hinge. So basically I have to screw them in every time I wear them (and it came that way out of the box).<br />There are a lot of similar options to these out there. I'll be looking for a better pair, but I advise anyone against these ones. Keep the search going!"
2.0,Not very soft for a Cashmere blend and piling started immediately.
2.0,"Loved this shoe, but did not last long...poor support for ankle and heel."
2.0,They seem to work as advertised. I've had them only 24 hours. They came after 13 days. I was not told there would be any delay.
2.0,Looks nothing like the actual dress. I use it to sleep because i wouldnt wear that out in public.
2.0,"If you have a butt, size up! They say true to size, and to some extent they are, but if you are blessed in the behind and you bend over, you will wish you'd ordered just a size larger. They're drawstring, so they'll work. Trust me. I'll get maybe one or two washes out of these before they are useless. Otherwise, super cute style and they fit okay, but the butt area is seriously lacking."
2.0,Didn't fit or look like the image.
2.0,The sweaters were great but China sizes are way too small!!!  I wear a 14 to make sure it’s baggy.  I ordered a 2X it stopped at the sides.  The sizes are not US sizes..... so
2.0,This isn’t all cotton. Must have some sort of polyester in it. It’s too hot and itchy. Cute style for summer for a short walk from the beach parking lot to the sand. That’s about it.
2.0,Way too small and the material is stretchy so it clings to you instead of flowing as shown in the picture.
2.0,"A little flimsy. I don't think it's really made of stainless steel. After a few weeks the back part tarnished. Overall, it's a really cheap watch. it's cute but in the end I don't think it's worth it. I would rather spend more money and buy something of good quality that will last."
2.0,Was cute just wish was bit longer
2.0,These are made very cheaply and my vision is blurred while wearing them.  I cannot use them for anything. I have purchased better sunglasses at the Dollar Store.
2.0,Comfy but gets holes very easily.
2.0,The kids didn't like these
2.0,These were alot smaller than  I thought. Meaning it can hardly fit my face.
2.0,"Nice dress, but two small, i order a side up, and was still small."
2.0,"Love this bag.  So far have used it for a couple training run/hikes to prepare for the Bataan Memorial Death March marathon,  and it’s perfect.  Good size, quality construction, pockets in all the right places.  Adjustable and much more comfortable than the more expensive Camelbak. I bought it specifically for the Death March because I needed a military hydration pack but I will be using it for running, hiking and biking all summer.  Great bag. I’ll update my review after the big event next week.<br /><br />UPDATE— I filled up the bladder on the morning of my race... and it leaked.  It was leaking from where the tube leaves the bladder.  Very disappointed.  Luckily I had an extra Camelbak bladder so I used that instead. As other reviewers have noted, the bladder leaks.  This is a shame because the pack itself is wonderful."
2.0,"Even with the size I ordered, It was still too small that it was crushing my toes"
2.0,Fit was different than past. Very box like and cheap. Loved the same shirts I ordered in past years.
2.0,I bought this for my son’ birthday and it arrived today poorly packaged and opining at the seams. I’m disappointed in the condition of this as it’s a gift.
2.0,"I bought these at the end of may, and until now, they have been great. This past week the tint is coming off the inside of the right lense. Bummer."
2.0,"They get 5 stars for cuteness, but nothing else. I knew they were going to be tiny, that is what I was looking for. I like how they bend open and closed and you don't have to try to thread a thin wire into a small hole to close them. These came packaged nicely. One earring barely stayed closed, and one doesn't clasp at all. Every time I put my glasses on, the one that doesn't clasp got pulled out. So I ended up just tossing them. I tried to adjust the post to no avail. In the photo, yes, my ear is still that red two hours after putting them in. Not sure why, they didn't hurt or anything, but I suspect it was because they were really tiny. I think the size of these would be good for a child, but they were tight on my ear and my piercings are near the edge of my ear. Super cute, but quality on my pair was not good."
2.0,"My son was so excited to get these, he wore them every day for 2 weeks! Then the charger on the right shoe came loose from one of its wires and that shoe no longer lights up. I wish they had been a little more durable."
2.0,"Cheap, see-through material. I will never wear them."
2.0,Not sized as expected.
2.0,"Such a cute pattern, and loved the bottoms.  The top?  Crazy describes it.  Didn't fit at all -- seems very mis-shaped.  The straps are super, super long, and the fabric that is under the bust, is super baggy.  Very strange, hard to describe."
2.0,"the watches looked ok. But they were hard to change the time on, And didn't last very long"
2.0,"i liked these at first, but now i notice that they're always sliding down my legs so the crotch sags, and overall they just aren't very comfortable and they are NOT breathable. totally suffocating. but the one size fits all does seem to be true"
2.0,Not a lot of padding here.  These gloves are OK.
2.0,This belt is just ok. The tie length is to short. It was not expensive and does not look or feel like a leather belt. I am a size 6 or 8. I would suggest to go up a size or two to get the length to make a bow with a drop.
2.0,did not have a universal fit to other buckles
2.0,I really liked this but I must have screwed it on too tight. I couldn’t get it off and the ball broke. Had to cut it off. Scared to use the other one in the 2pk.
2.0,This item has a very cheap look and feel to it. It is very much like polyester. I have not wore it and will not. I am giving it to the Salvation Army.
2.0,"They are way too big and way too heavy.  I have a fairly large face, and wear larger-than-average sized glasses, but these clip on's are just ridiculously oversized and heavy.  I'm returning them."
2.0,I returned this as the fit was like a mini potato sack dress
2.0,"Loved these earrings but I can’t wear them as the post was too large of diameter for my ear wholes :( never had that happen before, so disappointed as they are beautiful!"
2.0,The tool was not seamed correctly so I had to resew it. Then I noticed the flap on the other side was coming apart so I had to resew that section as well. I’m not a person who sews so It didn’t look so great. It made it through the night though.
2.0,"I wanted to love this ring so much. It’s beautiful, and adjustable! It bends so easy, doesn’t keep its shape and catches on everything 😭"
2.0,"These gloves did dig in the ground very well, which is why I gave them 2 stars, but they are not puncture resistant. Also, if you store them in your greenhouse or garage or anywhere that it gets warm, they will melt. Yes! Melt! Both pairs of mine melted stored in a garden shed."
2.0,"Nice, but long.  Not in overall length, but in the stride.  My son did not like them.  Goodwill did!"
2.0,Took almost
2.0,"Runs very small, the large fits a bit snug.  I'm 38C and I can't button this all the way,  it looks nice with a tank underneath.  However after several washes I had two large tears in the back seams.  Its a very cute top if you have a smaller chest."
2.0,Looks cheap to me :(
2.0,"I ordered this product after reading numerous glowing reviews. However, for me, it was a definite NO. Although it seems to be constructed well, the fabric does not have much stretch to it at all. The fabric does not appear to be dyed, rather applied to the surface of the fabric, so that way, when it is pulled taught, it is more of a gray color and not solid black. The zipper is only about 14 inches from the top of the mock turtleneck collar in the back, and getting into is an acrobatic feat, similar to an audition for Cirque du Soleil. Others have posted their measurements and what size they ordered, and I am 5'6"" and 160 lbs. I decided to err on the side of caution and ordered the XL, but there was no way I could wear this. Also, even if it did fit, bathroom trips would be a 2 person assignment. It is made in China, and the measurements may be off due to that."
2.0,"As much as I like these pj's. My 1 year old is obsessed with room on the broom and loves these pj's. He's 20 months and the 3t fits him. He's a, big boy at  34 pounds and 35 inches tall. My gripe is I've only washed these once with cold water and the color on the print is having and 2 of the letters in the words came off. The print is my real issue. I feel like spending so much money on a pair of pj's just to have the print (which is really what you pay for) is coming off after 1 wash. Not happy and wouldn't buy again."
2.0,"I have a hard time believing that there is ANY cotton in it.  It felt like parachute material.  I will admit I'm no expert, but it sure wasn't cottony."
2.0,weird cut - just didn't fit right.
2.0,"Did not hold up well.  Started to look shabby pretty quickly too.  Fit was fine, but not a great shoe for being active in.  Would not buy these again.  Replaced them with a much better product from L.L. Bean."
2.0,"The print is beautiful and vibrant but I found out the art work is stolen so that is a negative for me. As for the material,  its a cheap nylon material that would be best for crafting not cooking since I'm pretty sure this thing would catch flame pretty quickly."
2.0,"Loved the material and look, but the size (XXL) was on the very small side.<br />Would pass on this item."
2.0,I didn't like the chrome accents.
2.0,"Why do leggings come in essentially 2 sizes, ""too big"" or ""too small""? I am 5'7"" 160# and the L is a little too big (money on that the M would be too small). They are also a little baggy."
2.0,"I loved the dress as it's shown in the photo, but was very disappointed in it's quality.<br />I indicated that the dress fit as expected because I had to check something in order to complete the review.<br />Truth is I didn't when I opened up the package and saw the quality of the dress I decided to return it. I didn't<br />even try it on so I can't give an honest review about the fit."
2.0,Got this as a replacement for one that didn’t work from the get go.  Now 2 months after wearing it just shuts off in the middle of the day and won’t turn back on.  Waste of money!
2.0,I wanted to love these. I purchased to wear for a weeding with open toe heels. They were great to start with but the next day I had blisters between my toes. I would not purchase again.
2.0,Not worth the money! The 3 pack only comes with 2! I should have read all of the reviews. Material is pretty cheap as well and I could have gotten the same 2 bras at Ross or Marshall’s for like $6 each compared to $25 I paid for this item.
2.0,"Looks very cheap, wish I would not have bought it."
2.0,"Sizes on various products differ, they are not consistent at all.  Had to return for refund."
2.0,I thought this was a mask that would be with the stretchy material but when I wear it it's kind of thick it's hard to breathe in it.
2.0,like the color thats it
2.0,"Fits perfectly and is so comfortable but I had to return it. I wish they'd made the front part better there the straps were part of the tied part or went up higher. As u can see in the 1st & 2nd pictures, the front flaps are barely held up at the top by the belt. As soon I lightly put my hand in my pocket like picture 3, the flap comes down from the support of the belt and will just hang there. Youd have to constantly be pulling your flaps back up through the support of the belt.<br /><br />Also, the fabric was a little thick for being layered. If it was thinner fabric, the belt would look nicer as well, and not so stiff (picture 3)"
2.0,It broke 3 places too cheap don’t waste money please
2.0,"The seam between the legs came undone after wearing them once. Fabric is thin and does not give you that support and lift that other leggings do . Design is nice, if fabric was higher quality/thicker these would be decent leggings"
2.0,The face of the watch is the size of a dime.  Not for the elderly.The band is small and needs to be shortened or wear it over your sleeve<br />Buy a Timex. Save your  $$$.  I've  had this watch for four  days and it has already stopped working  Disappointed<br />Not worth the time to send it back.  It is now In my trash can
2.0,Very narrow.  Kind of itchy.  Pretty color though. Returned it.
2.0,"Make sure you really want this item before you purchase. It took several weeks to arrive.<br />I wouldn't call it a blazer. The item itself is very light weight, no lining. It's a bit longer than listed so if you have a short torso it won't fit as expected.<br />Return shipping was a bit over $5."
2.0,I don't like the high low look. But if you do it will be perfect. It is a pretty dress just not for me
2.0,Great organizer but my bag was discolored  - kind an uneven mottled color.  I was leaving for a big trip and wanted to use it because the size and pockets are just right.  Now that I'm back home I don't want to use it because of the uneven color.  Too bad.
2.0,Zero boob support
2.0,Fits smaller than expected and decal was off center.
2.0,"They are pretty, but hard to wear."
2.0,"The band itself is sturdy and fits great with the fitbit. However, I got the sand pink color, and I’ve barely been wearing it for 24 hours and it’s already black, scuffed, and just dirty. Not impressed. If you’re going to buy one of these bands, do not get a lighter color. Get a darker one."
2.0,"The watches look great, the straps look and feel great, however, the glass cover scratches quite easily and the rods holding the straps break very, very easily. Substandard materials. Cracker Jack surprise?"
2.0,"I read the reviews before purchasing.  I used the ring for a halloween costume.<br />Perhaps I was too rough while wearing the ring, but the stone fell out and is missing.<br />It almost lasted 12 hours.<br /><br />The sizing was accurate."
2.0,"The suit was ok, But I had order a brown one and got a orange one."
2.0,The material and style wise is very nice.<br />If the sizes were sized correctly this could have been a 5 star product. But in the US and where these items are made there is some issues. I would have liked to wear them comfortably but where way to small. So this is kind of disappointing since I have purchased other great products from this Vendor.
2.0,"I returned the product. The fabric felt cheap and thin on this color, almost see through. I have purchased several other pairs in other colors from Amazon but and was very happy but these were a let down."
2.0,"one of the small crystal pieces fell off almost immediately, However it is still a very nice watch."
2.0,"In the photos of this item, it looks really good. However, the quality of the clothes as not good as expected. It’s too flimsy."
2.0,Very cute but run extremely small . I ordered 2xl size 14/16 women’s and they fit my 10 yr old lol<br />Great quality other than sizing
2.0,the mask is so big I had to sew the sides to get it to fit properly not to mention it is paper thin! Complete waste of money!
2.0,Zipper didn't last 2 weeks. Have to pay to get it fixed.
2.0,Very difficult to read the engraving
2.0,"This is not a knitted sweater.  It's made out of jersey t-shirt material.  It fits well and is a cute cut, but I'm disappointed in the quality."
2.0,These fooliners will not stay on the heel and walk off.  I have to keep putting them on all day long.  I will not purchase again.
2.0,I did not like these leggings<br />First they arrived with white marks on them. The right bottom ankle was stretched out. I didn't like the material over my thighs. I liked the high waste.
2.0,"The outfit is really cute, albeit the material super thin- would not wear in winter as hoped, but the top is literally a crop top which is beyond inappropriate for a two year old."
2.0,"The gloves came in a pack of three and after using the first pair for two weeks, a hole or two developed. The same thing happened to the other two pairs.On a good note, they fit my hands but they all have very short lives. I informed the seller of the issue when the holes developed in the first pair of gloves and was told by the seller that he would refund me 3 dollars for the defective first pair, but I have yet to receive the three dollars. In short, the gloves fit but they don't last long. Look somewhere else."
2.0,"Lanna, you've REALLY let me down. Tried direct contact to resolve like ladies, but apparently you don't provide any info here, so...<br /><br />This *would* have been a five star review Except For the following:<br /><br />Due to a medial woe, I am unable to wear shorts this summer, AND I'm extra heat-sensitive. I live in NYC and it's been Hell--if they've got 200% humidity there. My first pair of Harem Pants was literally life-changing. I never expected them to be remotely as good quality as the ones I've purchased on here are (BANGKOKclothing), nor did I realize their comfort and convenience levels are off the charts, heavenly.<br /><br />Unfortunately, two of my three Bangkok pairs are too small. They are regular size. I ordered the third in &#34;plus.&#34; The smaller ones &#34;fit,&#34; but not at all baggily, like the photos and something in the inseam feels like it wants to rip. Maybe it's the hip area being pulled to its limit when I bend...<br /><br />Anyway, I am trying to return the small ones, in exchange for some Lanna pairs, because theirs are hugely varied and stunning. They are actually so similar to Bangkok, with the exception of a pocket string or two), that I figured it's the same distributor, as is the case with most Asian-wares on Amazon.<br /><br />Extra unfortunately, money got *especially* scarce and it took two entire months before I managed to place that Lanna Clothing order, and was only able to start with.one.single.pair. I fully intended to buy 5 more, but this was what I could do that day.<br /><br />I ordered for next day delivery and then there it was: this fraking ADORABLE nugget of excellence, all tied up with a cute little card (CAREFUL not to slice your new pants while opening said [clear plastic] nugget, kids. It's REALLY tight)<br />I had somewhere urgent to be and had not bothered washing my horribly overworked pair, knowing I'd pop into these.<br /><br />As soon as I freed the burgundy, paisley beauties, I knew something was wrong. They LOOKED too narrow and were hella tight in waistband. They also appeared short. Really, REALLY short (this is all comparitively speaking [to the 'plus' Bangkok's]).<br /><br />I put them on the make certain and my heart just *sank.* They fit much like the &#34;0-12 regular&#34; Bangkok's, except tighter AND shorter. NOT.COOL.<br /><br />Literally.<br /><br />Jerks."
2.0,Had to buy a foam crown to look normal
2.0,"This is so thin… it has no shape, it’s like a flimsy bathrobe."
2.0,Nice shirt. But not loose fitting at all.
2.0,"I was expecting a watch with a black face, as shown on this picture and in the ad.  The watch has a white face that has a whole different look."
2.0,No tags. Strange fit. I returned
2.0,Love sorel but these not so much
2.0,"The fabric is nice and overall they are comfortable, so at first I was happy. But then when I got on my treadmill I noticed that I kept having to pull up the left leg because it was sliding over my heel. When I took them off and took a good look I noticed that the left leg is about 1 - 1 1/2 inches longer than the right. Disappointing."
2.0,"Really nice looking and fitting, like all my other fox goggles. But the orange lense is not the kind that’s only orange on the outside. It’s orange all the way through and it makes everything really orange and gives you a headache when you ride. Also throws off your depth perception. I’m now having to look for a different lense for it so my wife can wear them when we ride. Kind of a waste of money"
2.0,"I bought the black/red adult size for a new pair of Reebok Classic Princess sneakers in black. I purchased another set in purple from a different brand for a previous pair, but these are not the same quality. There are also fewer of them, six compared to the eight per shoe I got with the others. There weren’t enough to properly lace these low-top shoes. My fault for not counting how many holes I had to lace, but they were also incredibly hard to remove after I tried to position and reposition them differently. Too much aggravation and a sore hand, so I think I’m going to return them. Disappointing."
2.0,I bought this for my softball loving daughter. It was adorable. Until it broke. The first time she wore it.
2.0,They are very heavy for my ears not my type of earing
2.0,Runs small in shoulder and bust area. I am a 34b and my bust was too large for this size. Very Short also so not really good for people over 5'5
2.0,Cheaply made. Like swimsuit material. It squishes my cleavage into one long lump. I was surprised at the quality and expected better.
2.0,This was supposed to be gold 😢<br />It’s a gift I need for tomorrow for a bridal gift too<br />It came in silver
2.0,Looks cheap compared to other brands. NICE arch support!
2.0,This mask is really pretty but not made for a woman.  Disappointed
2.0,Colors faded big time after first wash. 🥺🥴
2.0,"I received a necklace quicker than expected, but it is different than what's pictured. The circle has an ugly stained glass pattern in it, and isn't smooth as expected. Can't complain cause of the cost, and I have a gem I can switch it out with, but they shouldn't falsely advertise."
2.0,This is not true to size. Runs very small. I purchased the largest size available and it was still tight on my standard medium sized 12 yr old son. Other wise very soft and quality fabric. Color was nice. Would only recommend for very petite person.
2.0,"This color is awesome!  It fits great, but it's sheer, so you'll need a tank top to wear underneath."
2.0,It's is terribly uncomfortable and snags clothing with sharp band screws.
2.0,"I'm not confident that the material is 100% cotton. I've used other cotton masks, and they were stiff and dense. Also, the mask doesn't stay in place when I speak. It sticks to my chin and slides down my nose."
2.0,TARDIS broke off right away. I glued it back on so I could still wear them for my wedding. But that’s what I get for buying a cheap product
2.0,"Honestly, this shirt looks very cheap. The material is so thin and flimsy, I don't imagine this shirt lasting very long. I love me a good leopard print (which is why I ordered this shirt) but this just looks cheap and cheesy. The shirt itself fits a bit small at the top and is longer than I had hoped, which doesn't look good because of the knot in the front. However, I am only 5'2, so it may look better on someone taller/with a longer torso. It's a good casual, fun and neutral shirt with a fun pop, I just don't imagine it lasting more than a few washes. Also wouldn't wear this anywhere other than maybe a park. It just looks so knockoff."
2.0,Nice bracelet but the leather came out the shaft connecting to the clasp. I will see if i can apply some glue into the clasp where the leather stem goes in and hopefully that will hold it.
2.0,Was wet when I opened the bag almost like they just got done dying the color  super strange.  We will see how it is after I wash it
2.0,I ordered the Xl and the cups don’t cover my entire breasts. I am a 34D.
2.0,The appearance is not good...it looks like an old tarnished piece of  jewelry
2.0,"Way too short in length and small in the chest. The cups are made for a smaller chest, I'd say no larger than a B cup. I'm 5'4, typically wear a 14 and ordered a XXXL. The material isn't as stretchy as a swimsuit should be."
2.0,"They are very cute but for me are too small, you better have a small face, otherwise they will look very small on you...also they feel heavy on my nose."
2.0,Already coming apart at the top.
2.0,"The romper is cute, but I think it looks best on someone who is skinny. The fabric is not the best either."
2.0,"I already went through one badly designed retainer supposedly meant for pregnant women, and after a lot of pain and damage to my skin decided to try a different design. This retainer doesn’t specifically mention pregnancy in its description, so I won’t give it the 1 star it deserves in that context, because it might be just fine on a normal belly. But man, is this thing horrible on a pregnant belly button!!!!! With the belly big and round and the skin completely taut and stretched flat, there’s no more innie nook for the end of the retainer to rest inside of. Instead, the stupid sharp flat disk at the end of it digs into your skin and CUTS!!!! Because it’s a disk with sharp edges, and because it’s at an angle with your body. There’s no way around it. I’ve been wearing it for over a month at the end of my pregnancy and I have a constant gash where the disc digs in, and several generations of scabs. It’s a constant open wound and it hurts! Especially whenever something touches it (clothes, accidental contact, etc). The skin has even darkened from all the scarring and repeated damage. I thought the retainer with the ball on the end was bad because it caused bruising, but now I’d rather take bruising than an open wound! Too bad I threw it out in a fit of rage. Somebody needs to design a pregnancy piercing retainer that actually WORKS without inflicting damage!!!"
2.0,"These were not too expensive, but they were no way near as attractive in person as they appeared on the picture."
2.0,"Love the tie dye colors and the fabric is nice. Unfortunately the fit is odd. The bottoms fit ok but there is too much material in the front versus the back so it felt like they were on backwards. The top was huge. Very baggy for a size small, looked more like a loose crop top than a bathing suit top and certainly would have fallen off in the water. My DH judged the suit as silly looking though he originally chose it and is rarely critical of anything."
2.0,I was looking for a pair of inexpensive eye protection and these just turned out to be cheap. The lenses are extremely thin and will probably break easily. The frames are very flimsy and feel like they will break as well.
2.0,"Such a cute skirt, but very bulky and hard to iron.  Unfortunately, had to return.... Texas summers are too hot for all this material. Great quality though!"
2.0,I did not like the fact that it was too small for my wrist and I can not put pandora beads on it without them falling off.
2.0,Should have followed the size chart. Based my purchase on the review that said order larger. Wrong decision. Xlarge was too big. Ok looking shirt though.
2.0,"The material is so thin and cheaply made. It looked like an ill-fitted silk night gown. The purchase would be fine if someone wanted a cheaply made nightgown, but I would not recommend this for an event."
2.0,"In the photos this ring appears to be made of heavier and sturdier silver. in reality, it is very thin and flimsy. It will easily bend out of shape. Since the design is such that it can easily catch on clothing, I'm sure it will get lost or break the first time I wear it. It is not suitable for a young girl or woman of any age. My advice is to pay more and get a ring that is made better."
2.0,One of the gems was glued out of place very noticeable
2.0,"Beautiful but very tiny, was confusing and difficult to put in. Doesn't stay in place I have to keep adjusting."
2.0,Loose color extremely fast! A shame cause they were so cute!!
2.0,"Product does not look as it does online. I'm disappointed. However, shipping was fast and item arrived unharmed."
2.0,I can't wear it. I followed the size guidelines posted on the seller's page and it's too small. :(
2.0,"They look nicely made and they're very cute and blingy, but they're tiny. One of them broke off of the post the first time I wore them."
2.0,Fabric did not do well. Washed on the delicate cycle and hung up to dry. Fabric is stiff and holds wrinkles.
2.0,The first day outside in the wind it turned inside out and broke.  Thought it might last longer than 1 day.
2.0,Very shiny and feminine looking which didn't translate in the picture. Larger than I thought as well. Not a fan.
2.0,"Too short.  I also hoped for a soft jersey fabric, but this one was not soft.  I will be returning it."
2.0,Would not work on my thick hair. : (
2.0,"Great design, just cheaply made. Started squeaking after a week of using them."
2.0,"Very heavy rings. Felt durable but the welds, as shown in the picture, are not done well, and one came completely apart after only about two weeks."
2.0,Item was smaller than an inch even. I have purchased malachite for this same price and triple the size. Completely disappointed.
2.0,"Good cushion but I wouldn't buy them again or recommend them.  The polyester fibers do not perform well in the wash -- that is, you can't get these clean either with a non-bleach product or with bleach."
2.0,Not as good as image
2.0,Too large and too long.  I will ask if anyone in my water aerobics class wants it.
2.0,The waist is pretty big and the material is stiff and not very pleasant.
2.0,"It looks cheap and is very thin fabric. Definitely not a fall/ winter hat. More like a hot weather/I didn’t wash my hair hat!<br /><br /> I bought it as an in pool hat, so it doesn’t need to be fancy, but I was a bit let down by the looks. Would not buy it again."
2.0,Already broken. Sucks because they’re cute but the letter already broke off then today this one broke. I wore them for one day on our vacation 😞
2.0,"Not what I expected looking at the photos on the listing. It looks way better than it really is. For an S size, it's a bit too long for a decent dress shirt. And the material texture feels papery, not like typical dress shirts. It has a feel to it that it might be water resistant, yet it's not exactly water resistant material either. I'm just gonna wear it like a light jacket / outer shirt instead of as an actual dress shirt."
2.0,Pior qality & rough product
2.0,"This dress is cute and seemed to be made with quality material,  but for whatever reason the breast area seemed to be too small, revealing a ton of side boob..I find this odd because I am definitely not a large breasted individual at 32 B.. Returned :/"
2.0,Strap broke within 3 weeks of purchase. Nice bag otherwise but need new strap.
2.0,Buckle is difficult to release - it is so difficult I ended up returning it and ordering another slidebelt.  There is a reason this belt is inexpensive...
2.0,The buttons are FAKE. I ordered this shirt following open heart surgery since I can only wear button up or zip up shirts. It’s hard to pull things over my head. Fake buttons... very disappointing.
2.0,"I really WANT to like this shirt.<br /><br />Fabric is clingy but thick. It doesn't feel particularly cheap at all. I also love the design, and bought the red as I believe it looked best with the lace portion. It is also the perfect length to wear with leggings, as it covers the bottom.<br /><br />HOWEVER, product was a bit too clingy for my taste. It is skin-tight on me, not loose like on the model. Not very flattering. I would advise for others to order a size up if possible."
2.0,Not comfy at all!
2.0,"It was more of a dress than a shirt, and runs small."
2.0,Not that hard and the caribeaner clip (the fabric it was attached to) stretched and separated from the case. I ordered to hang on my backpack but that didn't work. I was disappointed. However I do still use it because I bought it but I would not have bought it if I knew the quality.
2.0,"If you are just debating on ordering a cute sweater, don't waste your choice on this sweater. It just fits weird. For example, the body part is really boxy, and the fit around the neck is too tight for my liking. The heart just looks like a big blob from far away. Overall this is a super lame sweater."
2.0,"I loved the idea of this blazer. It's very casual and longer which is nice, but it feels very cheaply made. It came in a ball in the mail so it was incredibly wrinkled and hard to tell what it could be like with some care. It has *slight* shoulder pads which actually made it seem very neat. I loved the ruched sleeves and I really wish I could keep it but I can't justify keeping something this cheaply made."
2.0,Nice style but looks and feels cheap...and it was.
2.0,Ugly fabric.
2.0,The rubber soles leave black marks on the hardwood floors.
2.0,"I wanted to love this dress. Unfortunately, I was very disappointed. Sizing is way off- this was huge, minus the arm/neck area. The tassels looked extremely cheap. I will be returning immediately."
2.0,Better to pay more and get a cap that actually works. This one's brim doesn't like to stay up and tends to fall down too much
2.0,"Its a beautiful dress and I ordered my size, but I had to return it because it fit too snug."
2.0,"5’4, 175, bought a large and it looked like a sack"
2.0,"Read the multiple reviews of a slightly small fit and short legs, so I tried a size up from what I normally wear. Im a fit 6'1 200lbs and wear a 36x32. The length of the legs was fine, but they were very baggy, the zipper was scratchy and rested right where my knee bends. The waist itself fit well, but also had plenty of room to stretch. The material was thin and pockets were lined with a weird pvc-type plastic. Thought about going a size down, but not only would the legs be short and the waist possibly snug, but I found a much better product in the TacVasen."
2.0,The strap broke while washing it
2.0,Material is cheap and see through sizing is awful cut goes way in at waist shows every bump will not order again
2.0,I bought a blue one from the same.seller which had a sash and more poof. This was not the same quality skirt
2.0,"Very cute ,light weight  for spring. My granddaughter loved it."
2.0,This mask is modeled on in adult but clearly is made for a child or someone with a very small face. I would not purchase this if you are planning to wear it as an adult very disappointed.  Also be careful apparently there's a restocking fee so you DON'T Get the whole amount back.
2.0,i GOT THIS SET AT A VERY CHEAP PRICE SO I DIDN'T EXPECT MUCH AND TH QUALITY WAS AS I EXPECTED BUT WORTH THE MONEY. DON'T EXPECT THESE TO LAST MORE THEN ABOUT 10 TRIPS BUT IT SERVED MY PURPOSE WITHOUT SPENDING RIDICULOUS AMOUNT OF MONEY.
2.0,these are pretty terrible. I guess I got my moneys worth (which wasn't a lot). Can see sweat marks.
2.0,"Looks like a thick hoodie, turned out it's like paper thin.... absolutely overrated..."
2.0,The little gold leaf's fall off. First day I put it on.
2.0,I'm not too impressed by the product. I thought it will be thicker than that.
2.0,"A beautiful dress, but I wear size medium and the dress seems like it was extra small. That's not United States size medium."
2.0,"I ordered my size, and the sleeves were too tight.  My arms are not large"
2.0,Poor quality... When ordering ..order one size up..we're too small
2.0,"El mono si es talla grande, entonces deben saber que la abertura del cuello para ponérselo debe ser mas profunda para que al momento de meter los hombros la persona de esa talla le sea accesible a la pieza. El que los diseña parece que su visión es sólo producir y no las medidas correctas de las tallas en todos sus aspecto. Lo tuve que devolver sólo por ese detalle."
2.0,"This blouse was SO staticky I couldn’t even wear it! I tried everything that always works for tough static cling and could NOT keep the blouse from clinging to me, sticking to itself, shocking me, and making scary static sounds when I tried to peel it off me. I’ll be returning for a refund. I’m disappointed because it was cute, but the fabric was so chintzy, it is practically a shock hazard to wear it. It was also bigger in the chest/body than expected, shorter in the torso (I have a normal length torso and could barely tuck in this shirt and it was way too wide and boxy to leave untucked at all - it definitely would not stay tucked in with the slightest movement), and the sleeves were way too short. I have long arms and am used to sleeves being a bit short, but these were WAY too short. They were just barely 3/4-length, which isn’t an attractive length sleeve for this shirt style. The warning that it is see-through was accurate, but expected for this style of shirt. A camisole underneath looked fine. The shirt is definitely shaped more like a box than a tailored shirt. I’m 5’4” and around 110 pounds and ordered a small - it was too short in the torso, too wide/big in the body (chest/waist/back), too big in the shoulders, perfect at the neck, and the sleeves were about 3” too short."
2.0,"The length of the shoe was exactly true to size. I got a size 8 and if anything my heel was hanging off just barely, but I know a 9 would be too big. The area for the toes fit extremely poorly. The clear strap across the toes was so tight that my toes were white, and my pinky toes went numb. However, there were gaps where the strap connected to the shoe. I tried heating it with a hair dryer but the it didn’t help. The shoes came in great condition from the seller, but the way the straps cut into my feet made these unwearable."
2.0,It’s nicely made and is pretty to look at. But I have a lot of hair and I need thicker hair bands. They will not stay on the rings/loops and I can only put the small hairbands on which you do not work for me
2.0,"Was happy it showed up early. Unfortunately THIS one doesn't work (the heart  rate monitor, which is why I bought it). Have had 'em before and lasted well. THIS one worked for one night and that was it. Not happy."
2.0,"i'm 6'2 and sleeve length is 2&#34; short, sleeves also are too small, i rolled the cuff up but can't roll up any farther, sleeve is stuck on my forearm. Tight on my biceps, across back. i guess if your 5' 120lb this shirt will fit."
2.0,poor quality not as large a fit...more fitted than baggy. not true to size
2.0,"These are good for someone on a budget but I recommend going for AvidLove thongs. These things come from China (not a fan of supporting overseas), they don't last long, the first set I bought lasted maybe 6 months before started getting holes on the sides. The AvidLove thongs are great, zero fabric on the sides, I don't need to use curb corn starch or anything while wearing the AvidLove like I needed to with these and the product is roughly $20 more expensive (well worth the price). By the way, I have about a 38 waist, so I ordered size large (goes up to 39 waste), with the AvidLove and they fit beautifully."
2.0,"The color green I liked. It is heavy, and not waterproof at all."
2.0,Item not as pictured. Can't even read what it says. Returning immediately. Not at all worth the money.
2.0,"Pros  , they magnify well ... When they stick . I was able  to stick these on a pair of Costa's and a pair of Smith Optics both brands high end polorized lenses , glass and polycarbonate . . I'd have to say they do work , but it's not simple to get them to stick and not have airbubbles ..One thing that helps is soaking them in near boiling hot water for 3 min , and clean your lenses  before you apply and be patient they do work but can be frustrating .... Once in place they work great ..... One more thing , you would think that for people needing readers the instructions would be in big type and easy to read but instead are in very , very small type ... need a magnifier to read them ... Kinda funny I thought ..."
2.0,"Thin material, sizes wrong"
2.0,The fit was ok (ordered my usual size) BUT it was so so short that I can’t wear it. I’m 5’8” which isn’t unreasonably tall but my torso must be disproportionately long or something. I was hoping to wear this dress out for my 30th but good grief I’d be showing the world my booty every time I move. Just wanted to warn any other long-torso ladies or those who may be worried about modesty. Super cute dress if it covered enough skin.
2.0,"I think the style of this suit is very cute, but the material looks very cheap. I purchased the yellow one but it’s a very cheap looking golden yellow with a sheen. The material doesn’t feel great and the pads are noticeable through the material, and if you take them out you definitely see nipple. It might work in black....but I had to return."
2.0,Beautiful but seems to break easily at the clasp
2.0,Broke after 2nd use
2.0,The material was of poor quality
2.0,terrible quality of fabric and the fit was unflattering
2.0,It is very sheer and cannot be worn alone without something under it
2.0,"This is not jersey material as stated, it2some weird silky stretchy material kind of like spandex. It has a bit of shine to it and is a little clingy. Very disappointed I'm debating on returging it. Not what I imagined at all."
2.0,Tears after a week’s work of use :(
2.0,Magnet broke off after using twice. Very disappointed.
2.0,Bracelet looked a little tarnished
2.0,"This shirt was big, I typically take size medium and I ordered a small. The shirt still went down to my knees."
2.0,I know it says how big these are but omg they were so much smaller then I expected
2.0,"Quality is nice, However I wanted a sweater somewhat longer. This is to boxy for my taste. Does not flare out like the picture shows. Returned."
2.0,"This hat is terrible for the sun. It's not ventilated, doesn't have a sweatband, and is made of cotton. I sweat so much wearing this hat. Instead of making me cooler, it made me hotter. It looks fine, but it was a huge mistake to buy this hat thinking it would be good for hot summer weather."
2.0,"Dress arrived, new in VIKITA package, with a citrusy chemical smell so strong I could smell it through the plastic packaging and the outer shipping bag (I actually thought the smell was the bag until I got into the dress and determined it was the source of the smell).<br /><br />The dress itself isn’t an exact replica of the image shown, which I expected. Kitty is more pale peachy cream. Stars and moon on body of the dress are embroidered. Stars in the sleeves are screen printed. I’m washing it alone with hot water in hopes of removing the smell, but now the whole room smells like it, so I’m not optimistic.<br /><br />Cannot speak to fit because I haven’t tried it on my child, and won’t if I can’t wash the smell out. But it looks about right for 2-3T, which is what the label says.<br /><br />For $10, maybe worth the gamble for you. Hope this review helps you decide for yourself."
2.0,"I got this to use as a mask, but I would need to sew it tighter in order for it to stay up, and it's way too difficult to breath through."
2.0,I got the four pack so I could share with friends but 2 bracelets were larger and 2 smaller. They don't flex and can't be bent to fit. The edges are sharp and hurt my skin to force onto my wrist.
2.0,"SOUTHERNERS: this material is that hot, no-breathe polyester that’ll make you sweat before you leave your kitchen.<br /><br />TALL GIRLS: this is a weird length where it’s too short for a dress and too long for a tunic.<br /><br />This might be exactly what you want, but it wasn’t for me. SO cute, just wasn’t what I needed it to be."
2.0,"It is a struggle to attach these to my prescription glasses, and sometimes I just use my sunglasses instead."
2.0,"I saw  the reviews and thought I would go ahead and purchase this. The fabric was uber shiny. The costume was poorly made and as with the mens costume, the head tear was horrible. I sent it back."
2.0,"This sweater was a good size right out of the bag but unfortunately shrunk quite a bit after being in the dryer. The material is soft and comfortable, but feels more lightweight than what I was expecting and more like a pajama shirt than a casual day-time sweater. The coffee color is a soft brown with a bit of a heather to it, and is flattering, but has bright white buttons, which I think cheapens the style. I think this looks a bit too much like pajamas for me to wear out, and will likely be more of a loungewear item with leggings."
2.0,I buy a 2x due to chest size and it fit like a large.
2.0,"Silver is too cheap looking... pattern is only on one side... smaller than expected... but, what do you expect at this price...?"
2.0,Very thin. Surprisingly very cheap for a company that usually has good quality merchandise.
2.0,The bottom has fringe and it's very poorly stitched. I wouldn't buy it again or gift it.
2.0,the color came off after just one wear
2.0,"I ordered Large as advised and at 5'8&#34; and 142 lbs. it fits me beautifully.  After 7 wearings though, it's pilling all over.<br /><br />Great for 7 wearings.  Then off to Goodwill!"
2.0,This would easily be a 5 star belt if the sizing was correct. I’m a size 34 waist so I would use a size 36 belt large according to their chart. As you can see from my pics the belt runs way to big. The corker belt is in the middle next to other 36 belts that are the correct length for a 34 inch waist. I would return the belt but already drilled two extra holes in it and it’s still a little oversized. It’s a shame this is really a nice belt especially if you are a vegan
2.0,"The fit is a tad bit small. The item is wide and short. The ruffle looks nothing like pictured. Ruffle is limp and smaller than pictured, flat. Disappointed that the ruffle isn’t fluffy and won’t stand up. White is more off white than crisp white also."
2.0,It didn’t survive one wash
2.0,"**EDIT July 2018**<br />I started having trouble with the GMT hand shortly after writing this review.  So, naturally, I contacted my retailer for service.  Six weeks later the watch is back in my hands and I am EXCITED!  I set it...and the same exact problem.  The GMT hand slips and won't reliably advance.  Yeah, I was done.  Back it went.  Fortunately, the retailer offered me a full refund, which really surprised me.  My brother's got an Alpina and loves it.  But I'm steering clear in the future.  This was replaced by a Damasko DA46.<br />***<br /><br />I am a sucker for the GMT complication. As a regular business traveler, this feature is important and the way that it was designed on this particular watch is especially convenient. As many of you know, there are a couple ways to manage the second time zone on a mechanical watch.  Rolex set the standard by using the 24 hour hand as your home time, or GMT time. The independent hour hand was used to tell your local time, and was set independently from the 24hr.  The benefit is that you are always looking at your regular hour hand for the local time, and the jump-hour feature makes setting it fast and easy.  However, because the date wheel is tied to the hour hand, it makes setting the date a little more labor-intensive if you have not worn the watch in sometime.  Most watch companies use a variation of the 2892 movement from ETA. This reverses the settings, and uses the 24 hour hand to tell your local time, which is somewhat less convenient. Alpina has changed this  by creating their own in-house module to use the hour hand as your local time, but to not tie the date wheel to its function. In my opinion, this makes the watch extremely convenient to use,  and a 'best of both worlds' solution.<br /><br />I was unsure how I would feel about this watch. I did a lot of research, and own a lot of other watches.  I finally decided to pull the trigger and buy the black dial version.  I had never seen the watch in person before purchasing, but did plenty of research. The design and finishing of the case are as good as my Tudor and Longines watches.  The bracelet is extremely comfortable, and relatively easy to adjust if you have the right tools. Otherwise take it to your local watchmaker and you can have it sized. It comes with enough links for an 8 inch wrist. I had to remove a few to fit it to mine.  This watch is run a bit fast out of the box for me. I let it break in for a month or so before taking it in for regulation. But, overall, this is a beautiful watch, very comfortable, and I am happy to own it. It claims to be 44 mm wide, but I measured it at 45. It wears large, but if you have a wrist over 7 inches, or prefer a larger watches, it should be fine.<br /><br /> The only complaint that I have about this piece is that the date wheel is deeper inside of the window then would be ideal. This casts a shadow and makes the date harder to read than normal. It is a design problem that they should  not have included, but it is a small complaint for an otherwise excellent watch."
2.0,Too small and not good  quality..
2.0,"Love the idea, the app was easy to set up. But it snagged on something and ripped off after not even 2months of use. Wish it was more durable!!"
2.0,"the wrist fit is way to small to get your hand into reasonably.  Expect more for the cost. This was for a 6' 2"" man with man hands and he could not get this hand in the wrist hole."
2.0,"Looks sexy if want to subtly show off your chest, but is a bit too sheer for appropriate office wear. Overall like the style and fits well, but I don't make a point of showing my nipples in public. I guess could wear an undershirt, but I don't think it would look right. Might consider a darker color less revealing."
2.0,"The bracelet is super cute, but the magnets on each bracelet broke the second day of wearing them. Both people were disappointed about that. The astronaut part of the bracelet is still intact after a week of wear. It is a fun, cute bracelet, but be aware part may break off."
2.0,The silver ones are perfect! Good quality. On one of the gold earrings there is a big discoloration mark that is visibly noticable.  I can't even where them.
2.0,Sized up still small . It’s cute though
2.0,"It was hard to get on and very tight. I ordered a L, which is what I would normally wear. But, even if I had ordered it in XL, there would still not be enough give."
2.0,"Fit is nice, color is horribly bright and not as pictured. I didn’t want to waste $6 on return shipping..so I’ll try to wash it out. Color didn’t soften after one wash"
2.0,I think it’s very soft and thick material I don’t know if it’s just the fitting I’m not satisfied with. I thought it would be compressed in the stomach section and thighs a bit more. I’m 5’3” 150 lbs so I do have some fluff on me it just isn’t compressing enough...
2.0,These earrings are really cute. And heavy. But the only downfall is they broke right when I removed them from the bag. Bummer I didn't get to wear them.
2.0,had a moldy smell
2.0,Loved the shirt just was not as pictured. Loved the picture shown on Amazon but the color I got was a light gray and blue camo wasn’t a fan of the color but everything else was nice just wish it was as shown.
2.0,"Was so tiny I could barely get it on. It was too uncomfortable for me. I usually wear size 4 dresses, so that's saying a lot. Would probably only work for a very form-fitting look, not a typical kaftan/swimsuit cover up look."
2.0,"tight arms, short torso; not a lot of stretch. I ended up getting a larger size that still looked weird. Not made for broad shoulders and longer torsos.<br /><br />Seller was very quick to send out a replacement. A+ seller."
2.0,Got this for a birthday dress for my  daughter's 1st birthday on Saturday. But it's way to big! Like swiming big and she is in the 98% for hight AND weight.
2.0,"I filled everything out, which for me is a task in and of itself. Then I tried to scan it. Well, it seems that I filled out my overabundance of medical information for nothing because it won't scan. What good is paying all that money for a square of silicone if you can't access the service you paid for in an emergency?"
2.0,Cute but too small.  There is a sizing chart BUT you aren’t able to select a size. Received a small child’s size.
2.0,"I loved this band at first but after just a few weeks it turned my wrist green and the metal color started turning pink. If you are looking for a band for everyday wear, this is not the one."
2.0,"It was beautiful, but broke into a million pieces just days after getting it.  :-("
2.0,The skirt part of the dress was so sheer I would have to wear shorts or a slip under it. Also the black of the skirt part was a different shade of black than the top and after a few washes I am sure it would fade even more. I'm so sad... was looking forward to this dress.
2.0,This dress is not meant for big breasted women. My boobs look like pancakes in it I even got a 2 sizes up still didn’t fit my chest
2.0,"The sizing is horribly off. I got a size 6 even though I normally wear a size 4, and this fit more like a 0 or 2. The material is also very very thin. If you do decide to order, definitely size up."
2.0,It looks good but it is too large
2.0,"They roll, don't stay up well and they have duplicate images in the back so behind has the same image in front.<br />Im going to give them away."
2.0,Not worth the price runs very small I have a D cup and they won’t work at all
2.0,This is just a regular shirt that you just tug to the side. Nothing special.
2.0,A bit tight jll try and shop again
2.0,"Should have sized up to Xl looks ok but not sized properly, a med. would have to wear a large, a large would have to wear a xl, and if your an xl go elsewhere ."
2.0,"Poor quality of fabric and not enough skirt.  Fit tighter than expected. needs a slight more flare to the skirt, very skimpy."
2.0,"Super duper cute, until they fall apart after one use. Bought two sets for my girls' School Spirit Fridays..."
2.0,The price was ok for the quality og glasses they were but if you want nice good glasses to wear all summer get some nice ones these aren't that great!
2.0,It's ok.  We found another pair we liked better.
2.0,"This hat is comfortably soft. But absolutely not slouch at all. I ordered two sets, one as gift. One of the mask was damaged, the tie to the mask was disconnected.  Will return it.  I'm so disappointed - really wanted to love this set. Bad advertisement. Must be for very small heads for it to be ""SLOUCHY"""
2.0,"My daughter will love the shirt because it's One Direction, but I am not very impressed with the quality of the material. In the old days, this would have been called a K-Mart Fall Apart."
2.0,The quality is a little too good. It's super heavy and bulky and you have to tighten it a lot to not get it to slip. maybe accomplishes certain purposes but gets very uncomfortable
2.0,The quality of the belt is not great and I find adjusting it to be too much of a bother.  Since I bought this belt I have only worn it twice.
2.0,Not impressed. The v neck creeps up towards the top of your chest as you keep the shirt on. Returning the shirt.
2.0,Watch fell apart after day three of wearing it.
2.0,"This garment has me perplexed. It is not labeled as a plus-sized garment, but the bust is huge. With the adjustable corset-style strap/cord, in the back of the dress, which allows for custom sizing of the dress, you might expect them to go with a less formed bust, allowing for a variety of cup sizes. Unfortunately, the bust has firm cups lining it and they are proportionally huge. The dress we received has bust-cups large enough for a size 22 friend of ours, when holding it up in front of her. I'm not sure how that is even possible. On the smaller women, for whom we got this dress, the cups are so over-sized that the bust looks ridiculous. I can't recommend this for anyone who doesn't have a very, very large bust. Good luck finding what will work for your needs."
2.0,It's not what I thought it would be I thought it was the whole picture I thought the cat suit that the lady is wearing in the picture was the complete outfit. The black bodysuit she was wearing but I guess I was wrong
2.0,The t shirt quality is very poor. Feels very itchy and I’m afraid to wash it I know it will shrink. I got my husband a 2xl (he is very tall and a 2xl is usually what he wears) but it is too short and extremely wide
2.0,"After carefully studied the sizing chart and ordered accordingly, the blazer still runs smaller than I expected. It stated it as &#34;lightweight&#34; but I was still surprised how thin the material was. I thought I was going to rip it apart just to try it on. The product is nothing like the picture. I didn't even bother to exchange it, I just returned it because I knew I'm not going to be happy with it even with the right size. Very disappointing."
2.0,"Advertised as flowing and loose, I ordered an extra large which should have been flowing and loose, was tight and the neck opening is tiny"
2.0,cheaply made thin
2.0,Three weeks and forget the memory foam. All it remembers is being flat all the time.  Not worth it for hard flooring.
2.0,PU Leather! Ha! Boy they aren't kidding. I like the bag. Got it for my sister. But man! The smell is so gross. Seller offered me 1/2 price back. I agreed because it would have cost an arm & leg to return to China. (Learned that the hard way with another item)
2.0,Not happy. I saw like normal Sun glasses. No reduction in glare as said for night driving. But they make a good pair of day Sun glasses
2.0,"They're tight as I expected but they did not wear well. After about 3 months of occasional use, the fibers began to bunch up in black balls."
2.0,"Was really small for me (adult) and I don’t have a big head at all. So tight that I couldn’t possibly wear this comfortably. Fits my 4 year old perfectly though! Sadly, I bought 4 of these for adults."
2.0,"Had to return this one because the shape on a fuller figure was not flattering at all. I also ordered according to the size chart and this jacket was HUGE. I would have loved to keep it, but it was just not going to work."
2.0,Way way way too long.<br />Too tight in the waist.
2.0,The scepter and crown are made of very cheap plastic which breaks in less than 5 minutes of regular play. The braid and gloves are great
2.0,The size that the shoes said do not correspond with the real size
2.0,"Not sure why you would use this instead of heating pad except it is mobile, but if you really can't use directly on skin-but over clothes seems limited in utility."
2.0,It arrived to me bent and mangled.
2.0,"I really wanted to love these. When they first arrived they seemed great quality - soft and bright beautiful colors. However, after wearing them for only a day in a pair of boots they completely started to pill. I was so disappointed!! They are not meant as heavy duty outdoor winter socks. Maybe something to wear around the house."
2.0,"Really cool graphic, unfortunately its on a very low quality T-shirt."
2.0,"This is one of the most uncomfortable dresses ive had the displeasure of wearing. the armholes are far to small and high up, the bodice is too tight (feels like I'm wearing a corset) and my ribs are aching. that being said, my cleavage does looks trashy, i wanted this for senior pictures and it's just too much"
2.0,Beautiful dress but runs small had to return it.
2.0,Not what expected hard to adjust once gets wet from washing hands harder to get off. Get what u pay for I believe it was fairly cheap
2.0,Not enough size adjustment so had to send back.
2.0,"This product did not look at all like the same picture. On a positive note, the zipper goes all the way up enabling you to zip the hoodie part right over your face. Might come in handy if you plan on robbing a bank or something.<br />Seriously though ... this thing was a joke. When I tried it on the whole family was in stitches."
2.0,Did not like at all.  Did not look like picture.  I returned them.  Very cheap looking.
2.0,It is very loose at waist... As I was running it slowly but surely kept going down!! I had to pull them up a lot of times... This made my workout very uncomfortable. I loved the feel of the fabric and look but .. Oh wow I was losing my pants literally!! And I got 2!!!!
2.0,"While this wallet is very cute for the price, it does NOT hold American money. It is too short to hold American currency long ways. You would have to fold your money in half to put it in this wallet. Who makes a wallet that wouldn't be able to carry money the correct way, when its purpose is to HOLD MONEY????"
2.0,Great. Except they’re completely see through 🤦‍♀️
2.0,"I bought two of these in August, and one has already broken beyond use.  A pin has fallen ouf of the buckle so it wont hold."
2.0,These are very stiff and do not lay right on your neck. I thought it would be like a loose chain but it's stiff and they started coming apart. It's like it's a jeweled sheet wrapped in a circle..they would stick to the back of my neck hairs and pull😳
2.0,"unforunetly, i was sent an 8w when i had ordered an 8m, couldn't figure out why they were falling off my feet when i checked the size on the packaging. i was very disappointed as i had ordered to take on vacation with me. had to send both pairs back. my sister has a pair that i tried on and they felt very comfortable and that's why i had ordered them."
2.0,It runs way too large for my size! I had to return this item
2.0,"I learned of the goodness of merino wool socks a couple years ago and now I won't wear anything else.  Cotton socks make me have stinky feet and just aren't as comfortable.  When I saw unlimited lifetime warranty on this brand I had to give it a try because merino wool socks are darn expensive (see what I did there).<br /><br />Unfortunately, these ones just don't work for me.  The ball of my foot and toes are wider than average and these socks do not accommodate that.  They are quite stretchy so fit my feet but after a few hours my toes ache from being squished.  As I wear a size 12 shoe I ordered the largest size so I am unable to move up a size and even if i could they would be too long.<br /><br />So, while I really like the idea of buying a bunch of these and never having to buy socks again, I absolutely canNOT recommend these to people with wide feet."
2.0,Pin got lost the first day. The clasp isn’t secure enough.
2.0,I wish i could wear this pain free but maybe its just my ears they are on the biggish side maybe normal sized ears can handle the fit
2.0,"I wear a size 10 and down at the toes was tight. Uncomfortable fit,"
2.0,Loved it but received damaged from the back!
2.0,Way smaller than anticipated.  Ordered the 2x as a gift thinking it would be nice and roomy.  Just looking at the item could tell it would barely fit a size 12 comfortably.  Ended up giving it away to a much smaller person than originally intended.
2.0,This watch is very pretty but completely useless because you have to install the battery yourself. They provide no tools and instructions.
2.0,This dress did not turn out as expected.  It's a heavier weight and seems to run large.  It may work well if you are in a cold climate.
2.0,"This shaper cut off right at my belly button leading to a really unattractive muffin top.  I was hoping it would come up to my bra to give me the smoothing I wanted.  It IS seamless but didn't seem to have much ""suction"" (for lack of a better word.)  I wouldn't expect this to do much slimming.  I ended up returning it for a full body slip."
2.0,The canvas portion of the belt is great. The buckle however comes disconnected from the belt every time you unbuckle. I have had many other canvas belts that have worked better. Will use the belts but with my old buckle.
2.0,Shirt fits as expected except the crop is VERY short. I am 5’2 135lbs. Chest measurement is 34B. Return was easy and company refunded quickly.
2.0,"Sizes were ridiculously small, I returned all. Very Cheap quality."
2.0,Not as described.. received ones without crystals.. Pictures show with crystals .. Disappointed
2.0,"I wanted a seamless for my septum and i thought these were cute and simple but when I got it, it was so hard to open and close that it was impossible to click it shut once it was in my nose. I wish it was a little easier to open and close because I'd wear it all the time. It's pretty tight to my nose which is nice when I don't want a super in your face septum look but i can never wear it :("
2.0,"Once again, the dress advertised is misleading. The one received is a cheap imitation of the one advertised on the model. The sleeves aren’t cut like the model’s, and clearly there are no ruffles in the back. Not to mention how thin and see-thru the material is. Disappointed.  Returning. (Won’t allow me to post a photo. Anyone else having that issue?!)"
2.0,Bought this for my daughter and it was a little too tight. Fits on the small side.
2.0,Very cheap quality. The 'fur' is matted and patchy in areas.
2.0,Too small in the chest and large on my waist. Very cheap material.
2.0,"This dress arrived on time. I was excited to try it on. I've always been a size small but After just having a baby 4 months ago, I ordered a medium. The fit for me was a bit loose. I liked the color but the fabric was a bit cheap to me. As compared like forever 21. It was doable for a one time event dress and I wouldn't have mind it but the dress came with defect. In the front where the ruching was it had a long vertical stain iron trails of the zipper from behind I guess due to the material it was. My husband says it wasn't that noticeable til I pointed it out. For something new it shouldn't have defects. For 20 something bucks I didn't want to Hassel with returning it BUT on the positive FREE return, so I just had to part with it."
2.0,"Cute, fit perfectly but bends very easily."
2.0,It's a good sculpture and cute but it's massive and heavy. It actually hurts to ware for to long and gets in the way as I do things.
2.0,It looks like the photo on here.  But its very thin not even medical safe in any way fabric.  I wore another mask under it.  The fabric is so thin and light the wind blows it off your nose or up your chin.  I say look at somthing else.  Maybe on a site where people make them by hand.
2.0,was not wide enough
2.0,Cute but color was more blue then black and I ordered black. Also not thick at all. If you like tight order a size down. These dont really hold. Soft material though. Good pant for just lounging.
2.0,Runs really small and battery doesn't last
2.0,"I have 32 DDD boobs, and I ordered a large. This top wasn't wide enough to cover my chest, my girls were trying to fall out. It was also very faded looking and cheap feeling. Which I kind of expected, but not to that degree. I don't think this is really intended for large breasted girls."
2.0,I would not buy. Arrived smashed does really fit properly.
2.0,It's fine but it is thinner than I expected.  I bought a black one from a different seller and it was thicker and seemed like it will last longer. This one is more like a t shirt.
2.0,"Not cotton! Material is shiny and silky with a lot of elastic in it. The tag says 100% cotton 😂<br /><br />The pink is see through. I bought a small which fit around my waist but too long. All around, it looks cheaply made and would not recommend."
2.0,unwearable for me and I am a medium size person not overweight
2.0,Evidently it's just pot luck as to what size you'll get.  Some say it fits fine and some say it's too small.  I have small hands and these are way too small.  They would fit a child. The fabric that should lay against the palm of your hand is sticking up as it it stretched to the max between my thumb and middle fingers.  Otherwise they're warm and I think would be comfortable if they fit!
2.0,"The lettering is so small, I would need a magnifier to see it, The necklace also doesn't hang like the photo. When it is on, the weight of the cross pulls down on the chain and it slides the little infinity piece, so that the cross hangs much lower.  It is not something ""nice"" to give to a new daughter-in-law.  I returned it."
2.0,Very poor quality. Not what I expected
2.0,"I really liked this corset initially. I've worn waist-trainer corsets often and was looking for a good replacement for an older one. Unfortunately, the plastic boning started bending after just a few days of wearing it, and then, it popped out of the stitching one afternoon and was very uncomfortable. I will only go with true steel-boned corsets from now on."
2.0,So I ordered this on sale in exchange for a review. However I don't have much good to say.<br /><br />Firstly I was severely disappointed in the quality. I ordered the black and it's see through. You could see my bra line and my pants waist. The material is so thin... Like it was made in China but it's not they say.<br /><br />I contacted the seller and he was weird. He asked me for a photo. I replied &#34;I'm not sending you a photo of me wearing this.&#34;This started a series of emails back and forth about exchanging it.<br /><br />I received my replacement top today. Tried the taupe color. I have to wear a tank under it. It's thin. Oh well.
2.0,Material nice but size too small
2.0,Wanted a thinner belt.  Buckle is huge.
2.0,I like how thin these bands are and they fit comfortably but after a few wears the bands breaks loose from the watch.  This is the second time ordering.  So disappointed cause they were perfect for my small wrists
2.0,XL was USA medium
2.0,received with a 4 inch rip in the stitching. also the material seems different than what’s shown. was comfy and light weight thi
2.0,"I really love the idea and meaning behind these necklaces but when I received my order yesterday and opened the package with my boyfriend, we realized that the clasp on his necklace wasn’t attached to one end. It is essentially loose and we tried to use the clasp itself to connect the two ends but it isn’t working . I’m really disappointed that this is the 2nd or 3rd promise item that I have gotten that has been broken upon arrival."
2.0,"Probably a great cap for the right person.  Looks very well constructed but two things made me return it.  First it was way too tight on my average to slightly above average size head.  Second and what really bothered me is I couldn't hear a thing with it on.  I love fleece hats but as soon as I put this on, and it may have been due to the tightness, It felt like I put on hearing protections and my ears were sealed off."
2.0,A lot bigger than I thought. Looks a little ridiculous on. I took the snakes off and put them on my Christmas three though! Ha.
2.0,Is not fit to skin and the rubber made is to hard ...<br />U suffocating when wearing  and sweating a lot...
2.0,"They're okay at keeping your legs warm in semi cold weathers, however one big issues ive had with this is that no matter what they will slip down your legs making them useless at keeping your legs warm"
2.0,very tight and zipper ripped. go a size up
2.0,Cute but the adjustable tie thing in the bag does not stay whatsoever. The fabric is very silky though so it’s a nice change of fabrics to my collection of scrub caps!
2.0,"Bought these for goodie bags for my sons third birthday. Most of the glasses came broken, I spent more time putting the glasses together then I did setting up goodie bags. They broke so easily too, my son was wearing a pair and the pin fell out that holds the frame together and it was just fell to pieces while on his face."
2.0,The fabric is very thin. Do not look like what is in the picture.
2.0,"Beautiful fabric, vibrant colors. Although the size Large was too big, this dress seems unflattering to full figured women"
2.0,I have to always get larger sizes as I have a 40DD breast size. Thank goodness I am a seamstress so I had to add a lace panel to the top. The cut is made for for a B cup. The delivery took over a month and I was very upset.
2.0,It was super cute but TINY. It would be a perfect gift for a child. I returned it.
2.0,Bought 2 pr. 1 didn't work. 1 little girl not excited. Would not buy again as gift.
2.0,The graphic is not good
2.0,Under whelmed.
2.0,Very pretty but will not stay pinned!
2.0,Much lighter in color than advertised. Will return.
2.0,There’s no compression at all..
2.0,"It was too long for me at 5'4""."
2.0,A lot longer than I anticipated. Ended up returning it.
2.0,Cute but medium fits too big. I am 140 and they are too loose. They are cute just wish they fit better.
2.0,Too small.! Really thigh and not as pictured.
2.0,"This is a thin, cheap, fleece ""jacket"". I was very surprised in the quality being so poor. The snap buttons are too heavy to even hold the collar up. Pretty disappointing and definitely not worth $30, I will be returning."
2.0,"I should have researched if this was a real Vera Bradley pattern before I ordered. This is not the authentic ""Concerto"" pattern.  ""Vera Bradley"" label poorly sewn in with two stitches. This is at best a $16.99 TJ Maxx scarf."
2.0,I normally wear a 18 pants and 2xl shirts. This dress was very big on me. It fit awkward.
2.0,Cheap thin material runs small
2.0,"I love this suit.  However, given the description of sizing. I ordered a US 9. Medium.  It's more like a 6 petite.  On the blazer,sleeves were so short & it was way too tight - the pants were more like a 4.<br />I have many suits and globally a size 8 is loose.on me. The suit I received I cannot even get it on."
2.0,"The dress color and style was cute and the material seemed like a decent quality but dang..., This was so freaking tight and SO short! I bought a size medium and I'm 115-120 pounds and under five foot. Sadly, I'm Returning it as it's not wearable. Bummed!"
2.0,White is vey see through. I’m 5’8 and 195 pounds. This dress came up above my ankles.
2.0,"My fault for not reading the reviews, this is horribly tiny for anyone over the age of 1!"
2.0,They do not work as advertised. Do not help with night driving as much as I had hoped. Takes the glare away from incoming headlrights but I was hoping they would also help brighten up the night a bit. unfortunately I missed the return date so I'm stuck with them.<br />Well made and shipping and packagin was great.  Just wish they would have worked.
2.0,"Im a true medium & ordered a x-large. It was humongous. The material is very soft like pajamas lol. Cute fit, ecspecially for the model body type on the display."
2.0,Lots of tiny bracelets. Just ok. Only one medium sized. Disappointed in the set
2.0,"Concept looks cool, but when put on graphic stretches and looks faded and unnoticeable."
2.0,"Too bulky, way too hard to see the skinny dials."
2.0,The there is an inside pocket along the waste band that is very irritating on the skin
2.0,The hang off the shoulder was wrong for me and the middle was not form flattering to me
2.0,Not to my liking ...it's rubber but it's for a cause
2.0,It just felt like I had a sticker on my ladies. Not comfortable. I was being poked in my armpit and they didn't hold the ladies up at all. Ended up getting a strapless bra for my wedding. Im a 36DD if that helps anyone.
2.0,Looks like pic online but as soon as you put the leggings on they loose their pattern since they are soooooo shear! See right thru them. Hate it since they are really cute and the fit itself is great! Will have to wear with longer tops. The bra fits well.  Maybe sizing up would help with the sheerness when they stretch...maybe?
2.0,"Very nice, super wide hat. The problem is in the way that they ship it. They fold it in half and then they fold it in half again. It comes in a little triangle. And  the folded areas on the brim leave deep marks. I had to wash the hat first to get the creases to come out just a little. I’ve worn the hat now for a while and the creases are starting to go away. But they need to find a better way to ship these things"
2.0,good quality but way to tight on my head. i have normal adult size head.
2.0,"Ordered — one for me (XL) & one for daughter-in-law (L). XL fits like a medium/large and L fits like a very small medium. Both very tight in the shoulders. Can only be worn in mildest weather. Outer layer is mid-weight Jersey. Lining is very light flannel. Flower print is bolder and more flowered than the picture. Still good value (except for shipping cost) and will do as summer evening wrap. My dau-in-law (Asian) says Asian women don’t believe American women really are built that large in the shoulders no matter what the pattern says, so they usually don’t follow pattern dimensions."
2.0,"This is a cheap spandex/stretch printed shirt. The low quality and oddly sewn neckline is unimpressive. The colors don't match the modeled image. They are brighter, cheaper inks. The fabric is thinner than expected. Of course they use a very thin model to make the product look larger for the size. I feel like this was very deceiving, and seems like a knockoff of something else. This was a gift meant for a family member's birthday and I was quite embarrassed once she opened the package. Too much effort to return, so I just won't use this seller again."
2.0,"I only didn't like them because they set behind my ears in a weird place which caused headaches. :( I liked the fact that they were polarized, a good size and stylish."
2.0,Great bag but strap broke less than a year later
2.0,Received wrong item after waiting months for it.
2.0,Very big!!!!
2.0,Wanted to wear this as a night shirt - too short!  But real problem is this is printed only on front. Returned.
2.0,"Bad paint job, gold is covered by the white, not very clear. Very tiny for the price."
2.0,"These do not look like diamond earring studs. I've seen better (and much less costly) cubic zirconia earring studs. Not one person has complimented me on them, much less said that they thought they were diamonds. The basket setting of the earrings seems fine. I'm not sure about the white gold quality. Both of my ear lobes have been affected by these earring posts. I have had some problems with the left earlobe before, but I've never had any problem with the right one, with any earrings, until I wore these. I have other white gold post earrings that never affect either of my earlobes. Definitely not worth the price."
2.0,Broke after approximately 15-20 uses
2.0,Ordered a size large bc these types are usually tight. These r really loose
2.0,"Only 1, even though previously description said 3 and the packaging it came in says 3pcs."
2.0,Not slimming at all. From the side makes you look even wider.
2.0,Poorly made and shows flaws....
2.0,Their photo is misleading. There are no sequins or sparkle of any kind on this suit. The photo is lovely. The suit (in person) not so much.
2.0,Super boxy. Fits like a mans vest.
2.0,"Tag says army green, color<br />Is clearly brown. Really people??"
2.0,I guess I am allergic.
2.0,Photo is deceiving
2.0,"I purchased the Harvest the Fruits pattern and loved the print--really unique and colorful.  The fabric itself is a bit odd, kind of like curtain fabric, but I liked it well enough.  Fit was so-so; a bit too short and the sides poofed out due to the construction of the narrow elastic waistband (it looks like a more streamlined, flatter silhouette in the picture.)  For the price, though, it would have been a fun, casual summer skirt--if not for the fact that the zipper won't close once it hits the waistband, whether I'm in the skirt or not, and I will have to get it fixed if I want to actually wear the skirt."
2.0,The cap is a little large for me even though it looked small. I wanted something that I can wear around the house and  look nice. I do however wear it to bed but have to make sure it does not come off during the night.
2.0,These leggings are super comfortable but two out of three of them came with holes in them!
2.0,Very cute earrings. I like the way they look. But they are so small I can not get them screwed together once the posts are thru my ear lobe. Very disappointing.
2.0,Good compression<br /><br />Soft merino wool<br /><br />Very THICK seam rights directly on my…<br /><br />ZERO fly opening
2.0,"I loved this cute little top but I read it ran small so I ordered a medium. It was like a size 0 it was way to small! If you order it, order 2 sizes larger."
2.0,I don't love these but they are warm enough. I thought they would look nicer.  And the string that holds the button is a piece of elastic just tied in a knot.
2.0,Gave these to my 18 month old nephew for Christmas and the bottom came off the shoe after wearing them for 4 weeks. Would not recommend this product.
2.0,It fit as expected then shrank in the wash.
2.0,Not what I expected. The logo on them wears off easily. They are smaller than what I thought. The picture of the logos and the colors aren't accurate to what you'll actually get. Not at all worth the price. Disappointing.
2.0,"This is a pretty print, but the fabric it just like a walmart's active wear. It looks cheap, worth the $15. That's for sure.  The entire dress is like a big stretchy gym shirt. Maybe I'll wear it hiking. Won't get buy from the seller again."
2.0,"i just received my second pair of these sunglasses. I really liked the first pair and then lost them, so I order a second pair.<br />They aren't near a good of quality at the first."
2.0,"These are not easy to work with like shown in the photo. The are hard plastic and stick out of your head when styled. I would suppose these might work much better with someone who has very thick hair, but each loop can only handle a small amount. I wouldn't recommend these."
2.0,"If you’re 5’6 or taller, this dress isn’t for you. The waist and chest fit well."
2.0,Colors are really washed out compared to the sample
2.0,"Ordered size large (I’m 166lbs, 40d chest) the dress fit well and the buttons didn’t pull across my chest like a lot of dresses or shirts with buttons tend to do. The yellow color was true to how it looks on here but the dress was see through. Even wearing nude color undergarments you can still see them through the dress. Not a look I’m going for, and I don’t want to wear a slip underneath. Maybe in a different, darker color this would work but I returned due to the thin, see through material."
2.0,"Excellent hot water bottle, flawed stopper.  I bought this product 2 years and 2 months ago.  I know...they say to replace it every two years, but the bottle is in very fine shape, with light gentle use.  The stopper (white type) broke.  I could not find a way to replace it.  So it has to go in the garbage."
2.0,This sweater would have gotten 4-stars BUT it sheds a lot!! Also it fits very snug and had a really weird odor😖
2.0,"Beautiful on model, poorly imitated. It's completely unlined, thin and see through. For the price it could've at least had some kind of lining."
2.0,"If your body looks like the model...i would say order. Sadly, mine does not.  You need a slim hourglass figure to pull this one off..."
2.0,I had a allergic reaction to the chain after a day of wear.
2.0,"These are okay. Theyre somewhat comfortable, although a little small but manageable. However, do not put these in a washer at all! I had them on cold and delicate and still warped the mask."
2.0,Strap broke first day of use.
2.0,"I didn't like what appears to be an adhesive Lund sticker. It was packaged in an envelope, so it was smashed down and wrinkled."
2.0,Lenses appear decent but don't fit frames properly.
2.0,The rings that came in is nothing like the ones I ordered. All colors are wrong .
2.0,Absolutely gorgeous and well made but they got one of the stones the wrong color. still looks close to the correct color so not going through the hassle of getting a new one. 2nd image is of another item I got with the correct colors.
2.0,"it is a very nice looking purse, but was much larger than i had visualized, so i returned it."
2.0,Was a great suit but after 2 wears the clasp broke.
2.0,To sum it up it is extremely great comfortable fabric with no pockets. Why is a company like under armour still not learning from nike. Please learn to add pockets even if they are small.
2.0,"the buckle does not close well, it does not sit well."
2.0,"The top is adorable and good quality, but the pants and scarf that come with it were terrible, they didn't match well with the shirt and the quality of the fabric was unflattering. Also- the sizing runs large. Was able to pair the top with different pants and it looked nice. The scarf, pants and headband that came with it are unlikely ever going to be worn due to quality."
2.0,Pretty but chain broke with first use.
2.0,Chesp
2.0,Was a small size for my daughter ...
2.0,It smelled awful
2.0,They all Broke after like a month of having them. Like snapped Into pieces
2.0,Fit way to small.
2.0,It’s cute but really sheer and unfortunately I won’t be able to wear it
2.0,"This would be a nice wallet, especially for the money, if the two exterior slots actually kept cards from creeping out when in one's pockets, and/or being taken out and inserted into the front pockets of one's pants.  The leather is excellent quality, and the ID window does a great job of keeping the ID in place.  Size is perfect for a front pocket wallet, will hold a half-dozen cards, plus receipts and a half-dozen or more bills without being bulky."
2.0,"Odd fit, I thought it was a blooper at first. I have a few of harley slim fits and they are fine but this one is off. Sleeves are very short and the trunk is large and long. My wife likes it so its hers now. Good quality, nice thin and soft though. Would be nice if the supposed higher end harley stuff stuck to the same vendor so you know what to expect"
2.0,Not what i expected. You get what you pay for. Material is very thin...see through. Haven't washed yet...almost scared that the lacy part will fall apart. On the up side the shipping was fast.
2.0,It is automatic and thus does not keep time accurately<br />Always behind several minutes on a daily bases<br />When you remove it at nights it is even worse  Nice looking though<br />It like a beautiful woman who has no personality and cant cook
2.0,One dip in the pool and I forgot to take it off...it turned my ankle green and changed colors.
2.0,"Its uncomfortably tight, I'm giving it to my daughter."
2.0,Sizes are not made for adult makes over 5’ tall or over 100 pounds. Ordered the largest size they had and still not big enough. I’m 5’10” and 180 pounds
2.0,I had to return this BC there's NO WAY the bust top is going to fit.  The black lace in the picture is much deeper than the real product.  The skirt is not as circular as pictured either.  It takes real talent to fit larger women in a dress and these makers don't have it.
2.0,im a 2x and it seems a little small and i havent washed it yet. wondering how much it will shrink. logo looks good though.
2.0,"Neck was too narrow. Felt like it was choking me.  Also, shoulders weren't wide enough. Sleeve length was good.  Body length was good.  Just needs to be more of an athletic cut."
2.0,"It's nice and it came on time ,it fits my nose and all but I only wore it one time and it turned don't waste your money ijs 😒"
2.0,"SUPER cheap material, doesn't look like the picture. MUCH shorter than it appears, but the worst this was when it came out of the package it STUNK to high heaven. It smelled putrid. I will not wear it. I don't know where it's been, but I pulled it out of the packaging and it smelled like 3 years of the worst body odor you've ever smelled and soggy garbage. I was so mad."
2.0,"If you have a child that is really thin, do not purchase this outfit. The shirt is wearable, but the pants are so big I don’t think she will be able to wear them for YEARS, and then they will have to be capris."
2.0,I purchased 2 watches for family members who are disabled and one of the watches doesn’t keep adequate time.
2.0,These run extremely small. I ordered a 2XL which is what I normally wear with a little extra room but these wouldn’t go over my thighs. My daughter wears a medium and these fit her but where a little baggy in the legs. These are definitely Asian sized. Material is great
2.0,The photo doesn’t do any justice. I ordered a SMALL. This night gown fits like a large on me 😬!!  Definitely Not what I expected . Of course I have worn it . It is comfortable . And the material is soft. Just wish I knew how big the small would actually be
2.0,I returned it wont fit my phone
2.0,"Larger than expected - and I have several of this brand's items. The shirt looks as pictured, but the material is very, very thin. Not worth the price paid. If return it, but it'd be more of a hassle than just donating."
2.0,"Not as big as I thought, but I love the color and it is warm"
2.0,"Stitches ripped putting them on, but they're at least not sheer. Keeping them but not excited about the tearing."
2.0,This is more of a gown for bed
2.0,I got these glasses and loved them right away but after a while the film inside then lens starts to separate and now the bottom of the glasses you can't see out of.
2.0,Love the jeans but Way too small. ☹️  Order 2 or 3 sizes up.  Had to send back.  Didn’t have the size I needed.
2.0,Looks like a pajama dress
2.0,"The dress fit pretty close to what I was expecting, I planned to get it tailored anyways but the gold color is horrible. It is like a shiny mustard yellow and not very cute. I requested a refund then this seller wanted to me keep the dress and they’d give me $40. No, I want to get rid of the dress and get my full money back. Then they refunded me $20 out of no where. I contacted them about that and they said that was to cover return label which they never mentioned while initiating the refund. I finally returned it and they refunded me $20 short what they should have"
2.0,"Original order was delivered as the wrong item.  I did return and receive replacement of the correct Smoky Quartz, 1st one I received was probably Sandstone or something other than Smoky Quartz.  Gave to my hubby as a Christmas gift and today the string broke, beads flew everywhere.  Isn't very durable, so we'll have to remake our own I guess. It was lovely looking, just only lasted 1 week. Very disappointing."
2.0,"I love my older Redwing, but these are just cheap. They look great but are really uncomfortable. Watch Rose Anvils YouTube on these. They're just cheap and it's too bad. I really wanted to like them. They look great."
2.0,The jacket is kind of cute and fits well..the rest of it is junk!  pant's are capri length..the cuffs in no way will fit around the top of boots..it's not worth the price..sending it back... by the way you have to take to UPS...so it's not a easy return...i ordered a size small...
2.0,This sports bra feels plastic. It doesn't move or stretch like my other Reebok sport bras.
2.0,I loved the watch but the band won't stay attached to the watch face
2.0,2 short sleeve tops instead of one each
2.0,Infected my lip 😭😭
2.0,Feels nice and comfortable just not very compression
2.0,Returned because of fit. As suggested I went up to a medium. I normally wear a small. Waist was fine but the legs were too large and wrinkled. Didn't look good.
2.0,Nice material however they were too short.
2.0,The first time I wore this ring the star fish part broke right off. Waste of my money.
2.0,"They break the first time I try to put them on. They may work on shirt collar, but useless on pants. The metal wire is very firm and breaks apart while trying to extend."
2.0,Size chart not accurate. Order a size up.
2.0,"Absolutely gorgeous dress but the arm holes were very low & made it difficult to move my arms. Trying to decide if I want to return it or have it altered to fit me better. Hmm... Decisions, decisions. Ordered in a large what an ego boost as it was way to big. Received my medium and thought maybe it was still to large so I ordered the small. Both the small & medium fit my body but the position of the arm holes really bother me. Considering finding someone to cut off the arms & sew it to be a strapless. As I love everything else about the dress."
2.0,It’s beautiful but not able to adjust after so many trials have to return
2.0,Product fine just to large
2.0,So hard to read.<br />Not at all water resistant - there's a hole in the back.<br />What's the use of having a temp reading that only measures the temp of the back of your wrist??<br /><br />Don't waste your money.
2.0,"Looking through them they are way too dark. Especially since aviators let a lot of light in around the edges, it is like trying look into a dark tunnel from outside on a super sunny day. They are also super flimsy, but that part I expected for the price and don't mind."
2.0,"I dozed up after reading the reviews that it runs small and I should not have sized up. I’m normally a medium so I ordered large. In my opinion, the medium would have been perfect."
2.0,The mask itself was cute but the holes for the eyes were too small and the tie string was too short to properly fit around my daughters hair
2.0,Returned Item was not what I was looking for
2.0,"I expect a well-made balaclava to fit snugly with no side gaps between the chin and forehead.  The fleece is heavy, but cold air enters at the sides due to a very loose fit, and this defeats the purpose of wearing it.  If my head were twice as large as it is, this garment would likely be a good fit.  My wife will need to modify it to tighten things up."
2.0,The price point was reasonable but the description and what I actually received were very different. Really small and not longer in the back as stated. There is no way this item is 1 size fits all or some.
2.0,Ordered this larger still tight in the chest. Shoulders don't completely open for PT. Found something that works better and easier to get on after shoulder surgery. Kept it because it is long sleeve for evenings after I can move arm better
2.0,"fine until washed, shrunk considerably despite being washed in cold water and hung to dry."
2.0,"Too tight around shoulders, too short, itchy material, see through .. sorry"
2.0,The shirt was way to small for a 4T in comparison to weight and height. Order a size up.
2.0,"Very short on the legs. Kind of like capris and there is no coverage on the breast area. Unless you're a cup size A, it won't cover your boobs. And I'm a smal person myself. I bought a small. I'm a size one in jeans, small in everything such as shirts, dresses, etc, and I'm a size 34B in bras, and I'm 5'5 tall, and yet it fit the way it did. It would be cute on a short girl who is like 5 feet though with a flat chest."
2.0,"I bought these in size 1.  My daughter is a 13.  She can't even get her foot in.  Runs very small.  Disappointed, since she Loves Beanie Boo's and they are super cute."
2.0,"My daughter loved it! It was super cute, but she hasn’t even had it for 2 weeks and the chain already broke."
2.0,Cheap looking and awful on touching. I bought this for my wife because i like the product photo :) So i was surprised when she put it and there were no socks :) I know what you gonna say: Why did you not read the description? Because i was distracted from that photo... So overall the product look and feel like was made in some basement in Central China
2.0,I am finding that most items from Amazon that the material is very sheer...Unless you want to show off your undergarments as well---stay away
2.0,The first pair that came was way too small. They sent the wrong size. I reordered and they fit fine. Nice pair of shorts for the money.
2.0,Runs small. Thin and cheap made. Was expecting more.
2.0,I like the top but it was to small.
2.0,These won’t stay up!! I’m constantly pulling them up because they slide  down!! Seller reached out and worked with me to receive a satisfactory resolution.
2.0,The black rubber tips are already falling off. I've had for a few months.
2.0,The side seams were coming apart when it arrived😒
2.0,Super small and super see-through. I'm a size 12 and could barely get the largest size on. Don't bother if you're not stick thin.
2.0,Kind of cheap material and really short on me
2.0,The chain was cheap and didn't match the charm. The charm was also very heavy and it was distracting during everyday activities. Hope this helps.
2.0,Cheap quality and didn't have the specific nose ring I ordered this for
2.0,"whistle was very small, could never use it in an emergency and only one whistle arrived.  sent back"
2.0,no what we expected. Had a cheap feel.
2.0,It was unfortunately too long to fit into my industrial piercing. Cute idea though.
2.0,It’s a cute suit but something is weird with the top. There is a seam right across the breast area making it look like only a nearly flat chested person could wear it. I am a C cup and I’m not even sure an A cup could wear the medium
2.0,"Update your picture.  They come with silver lenses, not blue."
2.0,"2 of these work well, the smallest transparent-looking ones. the rest can't be put on without an adhesive. not as cute as I was hoping."
2.0,Purchased at one price was charged another at a higher rate and the product broke within minutes of receiving it. A difficult situation to be in as a parent of happy then unhappy children.
2.0,It is too large for my head and comes off as I sleep.  Not a good fit.
2.0,"I tried 3 different 2-watt speakers, both 4-ohm and 8-ohm ratings, and in each case the signal was a little distorted and would occasionally drop while playing (a sudden, brief decrease in volume).  I was already disappointed that it was mono output for a single speaker - I didn't notice that when I ordered it - but I was determined to make it work for my project anyway.  However, with distortion and signal drops it's practically useless.  The only reason I didn't give it one-star is because it's still suitable as an MP3 player with a set of ear buds.  The headphone jack outputs stereo, I didn't experience any signal drop while playing and the sound was clean.  Maybe I can still salvage it for some as-of-now-unforeseen purpose to make a personal MP3 player."
2.0,Looks decent. Material is thin but they look ok.
2.0,Purchased these for my daughter... she wore them once and I haven’t seen them since.<br />She said they were really heavy on her ears.
2.0,"Nice light weight shirt, but no matter how many washings, the wrinkles will not come out. For most of us, that is an issue.  I gave it 2 stars because it is nice lightweight an comfy."
2.0,"Has a weird pocket design that hits right at the outer thigh, like anyone wants that.  Even though I bought it bigger than what I'd normally wear so it would be loose and comfy, it was super big throughout the upper part of the dress yet super short.  Didn't even hit the top of my ankles and I'm 5'8&#34;.  The shoulder straps are adjustable, and there is a back zipper, however it still remained too big up top to wear.  Even had it fit like it should've, the pockets and too-short length were just a deal-breaker for me.  Had to return."
2.0,"Got a large and it fit like a small, fabric is not stretchy at all had to return"
2.0,"My husband wears a 9 and I ordered a 10 to accommodate heavier winter socks.  The shoes were waaaaaay to small in length and width.  Nice shoes, but sizing was off.  My husband does have a high arch and I should have taken that in to consideration w/buying online."
2.0,"The problem we have with the earrings is that they are advertised as secure backs...which I thought meant screw on backs, but they are push on backs.  My wife with nails even had trouble getting the backs to snap on."
2.0,My child got it off within 5 minutes
2.0,The slippers were big enough for length but the top part is very tight and doesn't stretch at all. Unfortunately my son is unable to wear them.
2.0,No me gustó porque no se mira como en la foto parece un costal
2.0,"I really liked the style and support of this product.  It fit  a bit larger than size, but that is good for toddler shoes.<br />However, I would not purchase this shoe again because after there weeks of almost daily wear the Velcro strip was detaching from the fabric.  I had bought a different type if sandle by this brand last year.  I bought that same one this year.  I haven't had a problem with that shoe."
2.0,Engraving was clear not in black ink like the original photo. Can hardly see.
2.0,It looked cheap. Fabric extremely thin
2.0,The pants didn't reach my waist and there is a gap at the back
2.0,Lettering small but a as T-shirts okay
2.0,Thin material.  Something to wear around close friends.
2.0,Muy grande la correa
2.0,This rusted really quickly and didnt last long.
2.0,This maybe good for pre teen not an audit. I returned it.
2.0,"I was looking for camis with lace.  I may keep these even though they are VERY tight.  I have XXL even though I would normally wear L to XL and they are still skin tight. I only wanted them to use under tops that are too thin to wear by themselves.  To wear these XXL camis as a top, I would have to be a size small.  They are very stretchy, so I'm still able to get it on.  The cut of the lace and armpit makes it dig into my armpit a little.  I don't know if I should keep them or not.  If I found a better option, I would return these."
2.0,MUCH smaller than listed
2.0,"I have a few pairs of these workout leggings. They are very comfortable to wear. I bought a pair about a year ago and the fabric ended up splitting on the butt. I thought it was just coincidence and I purchased more recently, and it just happened to another pair. For reference, they didn’t split while I was working out, but while I was just around the house. They feel high-quality, but I have now had two pairs have fabric split. Very disappointed."
2.0,Don’t like the feel of it on my head abd it’s loose feeling
2.0,Not a fan of this product. The color was very off and the texture was awful. Not breathable at all and very transparent. Also very large and unflattering
2.0,Material is a bit rough it's for a shower gift
2.0,I wouldn't classify my wrist as small so this was way to big even with the closest setting.
2.0,Not well constructed. Tore easily.
2.0,Not as advertised at all. Mine came in army green and didn't even have the high waistband. Order it from Pink Queen. Actually comes in the style you think you ordered
2.0,"Wouldn't stay on and warm up. Even after I made sure that the batter pack was charged. Still use the jacket, but without the heat."
2.0,"Fits great. Comfortable. Side stitching fell apart after 2 washes , definitely not the material I am used to from this company. I have had some of of pairs for years with no issues. Must be knockoff"
2.0,"This robe is incredibly small. I couldn't even close it,  I'm a size 12-14 and bit barley closed. The feathers are of the cheapest quality, I would definitely have to purchase more to add so that it doesn't look as sad as it does."
2.0,not what I was expecting. Cute top but I feel the sizing was off somewhat.
2.0,"The colour was different, i was expecting a cream. Not sure what colour it is.."
2.0,Not what I thought but its ok I guess
2.0,"weak chain, broke two of the four pieces on day one."
2.0,They fall off often.
2.0,Thin fabric with no stretch. Bought my normal size but it was too small. Size up
2.0,I like the look of this but the pieces came off of the key ring multiple times.  The connecting rings are not sterdy or sealed.  Almost lost both items on the ring.  Had to crimp the connecting rings beyond the actual meeting point of the metal.  Otherwise I love it.
2.0,"Dress Was not the same when it showed up. The top was shorter and the ""wings ""started halfway down my breasts. Looked horrible."
2.0,To hard to set time. These are for kids.. would be great birthday gift bag gift.
2.0,"Fits as it should. However, the straps will not stay fastened.  I would not buy again"
2.0,"As a size 8 American woman, the sizing of these beautiful coats is way off. This large was too small."
2.0,Cheap material and looks super frumpy. Would never buy this again.
2.0,Fue muy corta de talle
2.0,"The bracelet arrived in excellent shape, but broke within two weeks. The old adage is true....you get what you pay for."
2.0,I've worn these earrings less than one week and the big princess stone fell out. Not a five star because of that. They were beautiful. I'll add them to my jewelry box for the butterfly back.2 star rating.
2.0,they look better then they stay on the ear the top don't stay in place
2.0,Fabric too thin. Comfortable yet not going to last past two or three times wearing. My opinion.
2.0,Very pretty but easily disfigured cuz the material is way too light.
2.0,"It is a nice color, but can tell they are plastic."
2.0,The watch face is great. It looks more substantial than it really is. But at its price point you get what you get. It will be fine once I swap out the watchband with something more solid.
2.0,Cheap looking and broke the first day of wearing it.... so I wore the broken piece as a bracelet and it broke the same day!!!
2.0,"Fits very small!  I'm 4'11"" and the size chart says X Small size should fit me.  I ordered up to the Small just-in-case, but it is still too short.  Size chart says Small should fit 5'1"" - 5'2.""  Nope! I would need a medium and still I'd be unsure about that.  This isn't a cheap costume - either put together a realistic size chart or construct it with SOME stretchy material so that it actually fits the way it's supposed to.  It would be great looking if I could get the right size."
2.0,"I bought these and 2 others from another vendor.  These are too snug, too long... I am only 5' tall but still ... I won't return them because it is too much hassle but I wish I had just ordered more from the other vendor."
2.0,Not really breathable with or without the filter in. Air flows  from the edges.
2.0,I bought the white after reading a few reviews that said  it was not see thru. It is in the back but is opaque in the front . I also felt it showed everything in the back and was an unflattering look. I’m petite 5’3 105 lbs and felt it made me look frumpy . The white is a true white .  The fit in the chest was ok but something about the waist and hips looked unfitted and just  not attractive .  I ordered the small and think an extra small in a darker color would look better in the waist and hips but probably too tight in the chest for a 34 b . If you have the right proportions perhaps you will like it but I would not order a light color .  I also think this is better suited for a casual event the material is like t shirt material . I know I would have been disappointed if I had ordered this for<br />a  more formal event .
2.0,These are cheaply made. None are the same sizes. Thread hanging off all of them....
2.0,Fabric quality was good. I like the design. But i ordered a 2x. I wear a 1x it was still too tight.
2.0,"way too small, not loose cut, returned"
2.0,[[VIDEOID:9d335f6fdcef2f7f1618661b5ea83738]] I was excited to get these but was disappointed when I opened and saw they could not be worn as pictured.. I ordered gold and silver.
2.0,Material has an awkward feel.  Feels like there should be some kind of barrier under it
2.0,Very cheap and costume like. Would not recommend for anything but a costume
2.0,Disappointed...runs small
2.0,I liked the idea and style of the garment. I ordered an XL and it was to small for me. The fabric was on the cheaper side.
2.0,This dress is a weird texture and is way too short to even wear. I'm 5'3 and it fits like a shirt. The dress doesn't fit on my bust nor does it look good on my figure. It was a bit too tight despite me buying the proper size.
2.0,This is very cheap material feels polyester even though it says cotton. The colors are definitely not what is represented in the pictures. I bought 3 and will be returning all of them. I really wanted these to work.
2.0,I ordered a 3x and it fits my DIL that is a large! Being returned!!!
2.0,I don’t like the fabric. And it was too high waisted for my 5’8” body.
2.0,"I love the Barefoot Dreams PJ’s with piping and a button front, however, these slacks while a soft fabric, neither fit well nor are they comfortable like the PJ’s are.  I bought the PJ’s for 7 family members and two friends this past Christmas (2019) because I love them. They fit well, and they are so comfortable to sleep in. I was hoping this set would be similar.  However, this product is simply not in the same league.  Do not waste time purchasing this item."
2.0,"I ordered two of these and they are both going back.  I am 5'7&#34; and medium build- not round but curvy.  These dresses were more empire waist or &#34;baby doll&#34; style than is shown in the pictures, and they just made me look pregnant.  Plus, THESE DRESSES SMELL.  As I am returning them, I will not be trying to wash them, but beware-- the material really stinks to high heaven."
2.0,I do not like the material of this shirt.  It got fuzzy very fast.
2.0,"I love all the designs I ordered, but scarf is VERY narrow. Thought it would be wider."
2.0,"La tela no es muy buena se transparenta y la talla no es la correcta. Pedí un XL"" y en realidad es una talla M"" si quieres ordenar uno te sugiero pedir dos tallas mas arriba"
2.0,"Its a fairly good looking watch - particularly considering the price; but its mechanism fails to keep accurate time after only a couple of months, loosing 2-8 hours per day!"
2.0,"This jacket is just a step above a windbreaker. This is in no way a winter coat. Is it packable? Yes. The real problem is the sizing is way off! This was supposed to be 2xl and it's the size of a mens medium at best. I've decided to keep it for an emergency jacket in my car. It fits me great. I'm 5'7"" and 135lbs. I'll have to find a packable jacket for my 2xl husband elsewhere! :)"
2.0,"This stretch beaded bracelet is smaller than any other bracelet I have purchased. The black beads are fine, however, you need to have a smaller wrist to be comfortable wearing this bracelet."
2.0,"Everything about this dress is great except it's very cheaply made.  I understand that the price point would indicate that  - but it was $35 - not $9.  Anyway, I wearing and the zipper broke.  You get what you pay for."
2.0,I ordered a half size bigger. Still too narrow. Sent back
2.0,I ordered some finger lights from oriental trading company before but since I was short on time I ordered through amazon to get them to me faster with shipping. I thought these would be similar and have a black elastic band to attach to your finger which one of the customer photos show the black band. These were not those ones. These ones are a cheap rubber band that is attached with a slit in the finger light so they constantly are falling off. I have younger kids (5 years old) who can't fix them on their own which means I have to fix them every single time.<br /><br />We are giving these out to my sons class for valentines which was a great idea and now I feel cheap because these are so cheaply made. Will not buy these again.
2.0,His burst after 2 days of use. Yikes
2.0,"While the item is a soft and comfortable material, the size is not fitting.  Although the recommended size was chosen, the actual size of the gift was smaller.  I suggest customers order the next size one to two sizes larger than the suggested chart size.  I will keep this item as it will fit my daughter."
2.0,material quality matches price... wouldn't recommend.
2.0,Fits well and true to size. The fabric is not the best and makes the dresser a bit less formal.
2.0,"Whe I compared it to a size 6mm strap I just had put on my watch at a jeweler's, they were not the same at all.  The Nappon band was much narrower.  I don't know why they would be different."
2.0,Barely covers the nipples and I don’t have large chest.
2.0,"Is this pantyhose? It fit nicely, but I could not see through it at all (I didn't get it to see out of it without eye holes cut out, but goodness). and it ripped so easily. So I was a bit confused and then became slightly annoyed that when the fabric is cut the strings start unraveling almost instantly."
2.0,Much heavier material than I expected.  Very bulky.
2.0,The quality was fine. The colors were great. My kids really liked the style.<br />But...they could keep the mask up.  So we are unable to wear them.
2.0,Cute suit but runs large. I’m 5’6’’ 120 pounds and a size small was too large on top and bottom.
2.0,Paper thin dress! I bought this to wear to a wedding I wouldn't leave my house in this!
2.0,Just got Vanilla color and washed as all clothing from Amazon smells bad on arrival :-(. After wash the sweater had stretched out and I noticed it is very very thin. See through. The Berry color I bought a few months ago was thicker and seemed better made. I recommend not buying the Vanilla!
2.0,"This could be good for one time photo session or something, but not good for using more than once"
2.0,"I can't adjust the strap. I don't know if it's because of the limited use of my hands, or it is just hard. And if you don't make sure you have actually locked the clasp (although it seems you have), it comes immediately undone. It fell off my wrist 15 minutes after I had it on the first time I wore it.<br />I like it, just can't make it fit."
2.0,The stud is really short and doesn't really fit that well it's still really cute but a tight fit.
2.0,"Socks are well made & have a good gripper bottom, but they are difficult to put on.  They're more like men's dress socks than hospital socks."
2.0,Pretty but I ordered 2 sizes bigger and it’s still way too small
2.0,"Color is nothing like the picture. Face is pink, trim is purple and hearts are light purple. All of the color was supposed to be the purple color of the thin trim around the face but all 3 are different. Disappointed"
2.0,Super cute dress on my size 1 daughter. The XL is super tiny. Like maybe a size 3z
2.0,The lens are so fragile they scratched up almost immediately.
2.0,"Not sure who at this company decided this was leather. The &#34;leather&#34; started peeling off after the first wear. The top layer is a &#34;veneer&#34; of leather -- MAYBE. But the interior is so absolutely NOT leather, any noob can tell. The black veneer has peeled off in droves. I only wear it now when it's hidden under a shirt and I don't have another black belt within reach. Save your money."
2.0,"I ordered these in Blue and also a pair in Black. I ordered size 32 in both, and the black fit just fine, but the blue ones were way too big. I am going to return the blue for a smaller size. The jeans are (obviously) thick and a bit stiff feeling, but I believe they will be warm, which is what I'm looking for. I have added photos to show the difference between the Black pair and the Blue pair, again both show size 32."
2.0,This is a great dress in a nice thick material. I received many compliments when I wore it to work.<br />I chose a larger size so it would be more appropriate for my office and it fit as expected.<br /><br />Update: a few washes later: all the seems came apart on the white lines. It's a cheap dress so I guess I got my money out of it after a few wears.
2.0,"I loved this, it looked great and got perfect everywhere but the chest.... the side zipper would not close once it got to my chest area... I’m a 36 C and ordered a large... moral of this is if you have boobs this dress isn’t for you"
2.0,I'm swimming in this dress.....It's too large and I ordered a size small......The dress doesn't flatter my body and the waist and bust area needs addressing. Would have love to be able to wear it.....because the colors are great; but I just don't know!
2.0,It’s too small I wish it was bigger
2.0,As soon as I tried to put on the bracelet the clasp broke. It’s made out of very cheap material and it doesn’t lay right on your hand. I had to tie on another ring to put on my pinkie finger in order for the lace to lay down and even then it didn’t look like the picture and I have small hands. I also had to replace the clasp with another. It was too close to Halloween that I had no time to return this item but I would not recommend buying this item to anyone.
2.0,Feels almost like swim suit material and is quite large.
2.0,I can’t see out of the shield it is very foggy and not clear.  They need to do better with the shield it is important to see when walking around and or shopping.
2.0,Not a true xl. Leg tapers too much for thicker legs. Leg bottoms have a drawstring which could cause tripping hazard.
2.0,The hole to fit the head in is SO small. My toddler hates putting it on. The skirt and hat are fine
2.0,flimpsy fabric
2.0,Send 20mm instead
2.0,Broke after a month and half
2.0,"When you fasten the back part of the bra, the sides bulge out and if you are wearing a slim fitting top, the bulges of the fabric are extremely noticeable."
2.0,"I was looking forward to getting these earrings. Very disappointed though. The product looks cheap. Especially, the big red piece, it looks like plastic. Only the smaller surrounding stones make the earrings look nicer. It wasn't worth the price."
2.0,"The Material isn't a good quality, it's okay. I'm a very confident person, but this jumper doesn't make me feel comfortable. It was good for one very short night and I haven't touched it since."
2.0,I wanted to love this dress! I had the perfect studded shoes to match but i was sadly disappointed.  The measurements in the dress cut must be from China because it was tight in the middle and way lose on the top.  AND IM A 36DD!  The sleeves are cut weird. Seems like it should be an off the the dress because it bunches up when I put them up.  But when it’s off shoulder style it seem frumpy and lose.  Meh so sad.
2.0,We will be returning them as they are too small and fit tight.
2.0,"Bought this shirt and it came very wrinkled up, so I decided to wash it.  The first wash the button came off."
2.0,"I saw a lot of particles after one wash, and the fabric was very poor.  return."
2.0,"NOT the usual sweatshirt material. Has no ""give"" at all & very uncomfortable. And, to make things worse,  I have to PAY to return it! So, make sure you REALLY want it before buying!"
2.0,"i usually wear a 10, ordered a 14 and it was too small and i do usually like these things tight. also, dark green is weird in real life, not like pic"
2.0,The fabric is very stretchy but the waist was still a little too large. It feels balloon-like because the pleats aren't very distinct. The fabric doesn't feel like very nice quality-- I'm returning it.
2.0,too hard to put on
2.0,I dknt like that its stretched out too much and the pictures just looks blurry
2.0,Sadly this broke after just 3 months.  It broke near the clasp at the bottom and the beads went everywhere.  Pretty enough but certainly can't recommend.
2.0,Ran too small!
2.0,"It's cute, but way too small--returned."
2.0,These really looked cheap. Pandora is a better buy even if they cost more.
2.0,"one shoe fit perfect, the other the strap too long so kept slipping off heel, expected better for price"
2.0,"I was really excited about this shirt. It liked so chic, but the fitting is totally off in the underarm area, it is not cut right. Makes it uncomfortable and weird looking when you wear it. Had to go back"
2.0,Fits dress wise but straps roll down constantly on the shoulder
2.0,It looks nice but it’s not the same as advertised.
2.0,"It’s cute. I wanted to like this so bad. Once you get past the trouble of closing it, there’s one thing you can’t really get past: it’s so rough and scratchy. It’s not just scratchy on your skin, it’s ruined several outfits: a leather skirt, a soft cotton shirt and a dress it made pill up and ruined the material it brushed against. The three times I’ve used this by the end of the night I’m carrying it like a clutch. Again, it’s very cute. But be cautious when using this and never use it with the strap"
2.0,"The quality is too poor for the price, i'd rather a American Eagle polo and they are a lilttle bit long, not everybody is 6.5&#34;"
2.0,"This says pea coat in the description and the way the picture is laid out it looks like it fans out like a pea coat. It is a complete box and short. Not a pea or coat in any sense of the word. Bummer because the color is amazing. It is nice and thick. If you are looking for a normal, super heavy flannel, this is your shirt!"
2.0,"In my opinion, it is to small. I thought it would fit like the one I had during my time in the Marines. I also dislike he feel. It is to thin. This mask doesn't work well aro7nd heavy dust and doesn't protect from the sun like I would like it to do so"
2.0,The bust padding  doesn't sit (too high)where it will accommodate all size breasts
2.0,cute but shirt runs small
2.0,The cotton is very thin: washing it once showed it to be of poor quality
2.0,Odd fit. I’m 5’0 and usually a size zero. Based on the reviews of people sizing down I thought this might be a good buy for me as I usually fit better in the Chinese sizing. This we’re still pretty big and not flattering at all. Ending up returning them for a refund.
2.0,"Fits prerfect but fabric is too thin, almost see through"
2.0,Quality is AWFUL. it's a weird stretch/plastic-y material. It runs a bit small.
2.0,"Did not fit at all what expected. Super long, I am 5'4 and it dragged. Super loose on arms. Waist line didn't come in as I had hoped"
2.0,More like a children’s small than an adult small...
2.0,With the gel-filled pads we had expected a better result...but found little relief.
2.0,They are such poor quality that they fell apart within a day.<br />The plastic in the frame and temples is so thin that I'm surprised the hinge gave first.
2.0,"First time I wore the socks, the right sock got a hole in the toe.  The second time I wore them, the left sock developed a hole in the toe. Otherwise, I like the fit."
2.0,Okay but expected more for the price.
2.0,Draw string came out of the pants after the 1st wash.  Very disappointed.
2.0,To small even for 2 year old
2.0,"Hmmmm, for some reason I thought these were rain gear overshoes for biking. Water pours right through them. They'd make a good cheese cloth! I really don't understand what they are good for???"
2.0,Quality of material poor
2.0,Item not as pictured.  Too small. Very little stretch.  Material thin.
2.0,Doesn’t fit as expected.  Had to return “medium” and get an extra large.  I’ve always ordered medium for my wife but opening the package it looked like an extra small.
2.0,Not a quality shirt
2.0,"The lines on the back are suppose to be just under the butt cheek but my pants the lines are longer and go to the middle of the thigh which doesn’t look like the picture, more Chinese junk!"
2.0,It was not at all obvious to me from the photo that the surface of the fabric is not smooth but sheep-like. A purple sheep. An ugly purple sheep. Baaaaad. Going baaaaack.
2.0,"The dress is paper thin, I can't believe how bad the fabric is for being this price. It's basically sheer. It's also too short, it stops at my hips. Basically a shirt lol<br />The leg things are not stretchy. I'm regularly a size large the XL does not fit my calves. I'd pass on this one.<br /><br />The only pro is the top is very beautifully constructed. The fit is so good (order a size up). But I would not recommend this for this price tag."
2.0,Wasn't good quality
2.0,"I will start by saying this dress was super soft. Other than that, it was down hill from there...it gathered awkwardly at both the elastic waist and in the front where the tie. The extra material made you look frumpy. At 5'7, I ordered an XL, and it hit right at the knee. This wasn't what I expected and returned."
2.0,They’re okay.... ugh I hate the pockets in the back are way off they’re closer to my back waist line then they should be to your actual butt... they just should’ve left off the pockets. And thennnnn the zipper is way off as well and makes it look weird they just shouldn’t have put a zipper at all... however the material is nice and the front pockets are nice and deep. I’ll need to get them re-configured with my seamstress to make them how I’d like. For the price I guess I’ll keep them.
2.0,I have several Zattcas dresses in size small however this one fit much differently.  The bodice part was very tight and I could breathe.  The length of dress was much longer than the other dresses from Zattcas.
2.0,I was so happy to find long sleeves with shorts. Unfortunately the seem ripped along the bottom hem after a few weeks. I’ve hand stitched it back together but i will probably never buy these again. Too bad because it’s so hard to find this combo of long sleeves and shorts
2.0,Small. Bad stitching
2.0,"Zipper broke very 1st day,  on about the 3rd zip.<br /><br />Nice Bag,  Crap Zipper."
2.0,"I got this for Christmas from my husband and the size was just right.  The size chart is accurate if you know your measurements. I tried it on, on Christmas day, and was happy, standing still looking at in the mirror on me after I smoothed it out and adjusted it to fit just right. I tried actually wearing it a few of weeks after Christmas, because I thought I might have Covid, so I erred on the side of safety and stayed home for almost 3 weeks.  During that time I washed the sweater (thinking it was a ""keeper"").  When you put it on, and then begin to move about, it bunches really unflatteringly in the waist area.  Tucking it in does not help.  I tried it with all sorts of different bottoms:  slim skirts, full circle skirts, even high waist circle skirts with a broad waistband, and nope.  It bulges and makes it look like I have rollS.  Untucking it does not help.  And it tends to crawl up your chest too, if you have larger breasts.  I tried wearing it the my normal everyday bras and also a very satiny smooth bra and it still rode up, almost worse with the satin bra.  It's made from 100% thin and slinky synthetic materials with zero shape integrity, and honestly, it's poor quality fabric.  Now, with what I know, looking back at the super skinny model photos, you can kind of see it lumping even on them and/or they are holding their arms to cover their waist in some photos--to avoid showing the lumping.  Keep in mind, they are posed and arranged right before shooting, so if it looks even slightly bumpy on their twig size frames, imagine how clumpy it will be on your average woman with curves after moving about in this sweater.<br /><br />I wish belle poque would use more natural fibers, it would also be more historically accurate for the time period.  Sweaters in the 50's would have been made from wool, cotton, angora or silk yarns for finer knits with little stretch and good recovery.  This thing stretches wayyyy too much, and that is part of the problem.  I am stuck with it now and I thought about altering it, but  I think if I can even minimize the rolls at the waist, it will still ride up on my chest.  What good is a nice looking garment if it looks like trash when you actually wear it?  Common Belle Poque, use quality materials and we will pay more for them.  I want timeless pieces that will last not ""fast fashion"" of the moment that is throw away when the trend goes out of style in 3 months.  ****Vintage style for life."
2.0,It’s way too long!
2.0,Did not like that the sleeves are not sewn or pre-rolled and you have to roll and clasp them. I’m returning it
2.0,"First let me say the fabric, colors and the length are great.<br />I'm a B cup and shelf-bra area is too small. The whole cami rides up as well if it's not tucked in.<br />Will not order these again."
2.0,"The picture was a bit misleading, it looked like two bracelets but when it arrived it was one that you have to twist/wrap to look like two bracelets."
2.0,"The picture and write-up made it look and sound like it was much nicer than it actually is.  It wasn't poor quality but it sure wasn't what I expected or hoped for.  It was a gift, but I didn't give it to anyone."
2.0,My mother was unable to use. No large enough to be comfortable.
2.0,I didn't realize dress was China sizes. Couldn't get it over my breasts with a bra on 😡
2.0,Returned item because it was not nearly as tough as advertised.  Looked pretty cool but was HEAVY.
2.0,zipper was difficult to pull up and down.lubed it with graphite and silicone. no better.  Went back to laces!
2.0,"Revised review... how irritating! Within a week of owning, there are already small holes all around every seam (few inner leg seam and one right at in the backside!) I can't return them because I've now worn them and don't have the tags. Not worth the amount paid.<br /><br />Original Review: About 1 size smaller than expected, so if you're a medium, a large will fit perfectly. I read previous reviews and ordered accordingly and am very happy! They look nice and are comfy. Minus 1 star because the size is mislead."
2.0,"The zippers at the knees fell apart only 6 months into use, had only worn them a handful of times so life expectancy isnt great."
2.0,This photo make this scarf look nice and big. Well it will barely go around my neck!! Which is small. Color is not as dark. It's pretty but not as shown. It looks square in photo. It's not. Just feel duped
2.0,"I really wanted to love this dress, especially since it was only $10! I read the reviews and had high hopes because people said it was a beautiful red and thick material. I did not find that to be the case for me. The red is not a darker red as the photo indicates, it's more of an orange-red, sort of a hybrid between their orange and red photos in the color options, definitely not a holiday red like I was hoping for. The material is thicker than most of the cheap dresses/tops sold on Amazon, but not thick enough that your bra doesn't show through.<br /><br />For size reference, I ordered a large. I'm 5'4, 175lbs, 36DD. It fit okay in the bust, but the waist and skirt were too loose and looked a bit baggy. It was also too long, hitting around the knee which just looked awkward...like it should either be shorter or longer. The whole thing was very unflattering for my figure, so I'm sending it back."
2.0,"Elastic, sure. Form-fitting, definitely. Compression? No."
2.0,This is more for a teenager and not an adult woman. Runs very small
2.0,material is very clingy-color is nice (dark green)...wash it ALONE as it bleeds profusely....and the wrinkles don't seem to come out as you hang it to dry
2.0,"It fits ok but it looks weird. There is something wrong with the design, I really don't like it"
2.0,Third time wearing it & the seem is falling apart between the legs.
2.0,"This dress looked great when I pulled it out of the bag. It’s made of pretty heavy weight material. I read the reviews saying it runs small and although I would normally order a Large, I ordered an XXL. The majority of the dress looks plenty big and I expected it to be baggy but 1. I could barely fit my head through the neck opening, and 2. I could not pull the waist area down over my chest. If this dress had a zipper it would probably be great but without the zipper there’s no hope of getting it on."
2.0,The 8 ball rack had a slight blemish as well but the 9/10 ball rack was much worse. The racks rely on being perfectly even and flat
2.0,"Too cheap quality, definitely not worth the price"
2.0,It is to small I wear a medium and it was too snug
2.0,Had a whole in the back.
2.0,I won't buy them again.  The quality was bad
2.0,"The item was smaller and fit smaller. Did not prefer this, so I returned it."
2.0,"The product was advertised as peach color, but it was a bright pink."
2.0,"I am a heavier set guy, and I've ordered other hoodies in a size 3XL that have fit me. This one fits like a 2X, and is too small for me. Disappointing, because it looks great."
2.0,Was very disappointed because we thought this was a boys clog.  They are definitely girls only.  Don't buy if you are looking for boy shoes.  We will be returning.  They are cute for girls.
2.0,"I actually bought 2, they both tore the 2st day my girls used it. Just a quick punch through hole perfect circles on the pop dimples. Not worth my money."
2.0,"This dress is ok as maybe a bathing suit cover, but that's about it. It's super thin material, and the fit is very loose and boxy."
2.0,"My son is tough on shoes,  but these literally fell apart.  The soles separated from the shoe part after 5 or 6 weeks"
2.0,Cute shorts but had several holes throughout the shorts. Looked like someone took a scissors to them
2.0,These are much larger than I thought they would be.
2.0,Small band. Dim light.
2.0,I love the trolley but the telescoping handle stopped working within a month of using it so now it has to be carried.
2.0,Sent back. Hat rolled in the bag it came in. It was super flimsy and crinkled when taking out the container.
2.0,Socks arrived very discolored & faded. Highly disappointed.  They definitely look nothing like the photo. Poor quality!!!
2.0,Cut was terrible - wider in middle than at ends of the jacket - no tailoring at all. Like a giant square box.
2.0,"Pretty, but junky. One gets what one pays for I guess."
2.0,"bought an XL and it fit like a Medium, and not in a flattering way."
2.0,"I could not believe that when I put my checkbook in this item callled a ‘checkbook”, you could not snap it???  Did not even try to use it further so I don’t know how cards fit, etc"
2.0,Super Hard to snap
2.0,VERY small and I ordered a large. Would have liked it otherwise.
2.0,Super cute and so fun but left shoe lights stopped working first day and won't charge. Sad 5 year old
2.0,"The socks are only OK, and maybe not even that. They are fun and attractive enough, although some of the colors are better than others. For some reason the pinks are just kind of ugly. Oddly, they are a little on the large side, which is an experience I've never had with socks.  They are pretty significantly thinner than I anticipated, and there are lots and lots of loose threads on the inside, making me a bit concerned about their durability.  The box they came in was potentially nice for gift giving, except this was crushed and broken, and was obviously that way before shipment, since the lid was scotch-taped at the corners. I also had the sense, from the way they were packaged, that the product was not new, but had been previously returned - not necessarily worn, but tried on and sent back. All in all, they did not live up to expectations, and not worth the cost, but also probably not worth the effort to return."
2.0,It had potential. I'm in the small green 😒
2.0,Looks & fits fine. Breathing is not comfortable & that is without the filter. A deeper breath through the mouth causes the mask to be sucked into your mouth blocking significant air passage. Also it becomes too warm & wet within minutes. I will not try to return since I wore it but want others to be aware since our bodies REQUIRE sufficient oxygen.
2.0,Ripped in the first use. Also color faded off quickly in the feet and bottom areas of the tail fin.<br />The colors were bright and the outfit was very cute.  Disappointed about the ripping on the fin in just an hour.
2.0,Cute dress. But the description said it is cotton and the tag inside says “100% cotton” - it’s synthetic/nylon -stretchy and thin like a one piece swimsuit.
2.0,Band waaay too small
2.0,They are ok... they are pretty bulky.
2.0,Will return it because I'm 5 ft 3 &#34; and  it's way too long. The dress arrived in a plastic bag no tags it looked like a used item extremely wrinkled . Very disappointed.
2.0,"Based on others' reviews, I ordered two sizes up.  I'm 5' 6"", 144 pounds and normally wear a medium or size 8.  The 1X I ordered was simply way too huge and shapeless.  I'm afraid to reorder in my size because chances are it would be way too small.  Only redeeming factors are the fabric is soft and the sleeves are truly 3/4 length.  I wish the manufacturers would be more consistent so we wouldn't be left with a guessing game."
2.0,Not really a good purchase for headband use if you actually want it to stay in place.
2.0,"does not look good. i am regular height and when pulled up, i can pull it over my 'lady bumps'...not what it is intended for. too late to send back."
2.0,"Too heavy, pretty"
2.0,"I've had the branded ones, so comparing the two, you can see a striking difference in material quality. The frame seems to be made of some cheap, light plastic that will probably break the moment you drop it. I'm thinking of that scene in Batman Begins when Bruce orders a bunch of graphite masks and they shatter when he bends 'em....<br /><br />But they are very light, so very little pressure on your nose."
2.0,"bad quality,"
2.0,They are really cute but way to big for a 7
2.0,"The picture is misleading, the material looks different than shown in the pic. Just received it, and if u want to see the actual material on the photo shown u have to zoom in really well. I should've ordered one size bigger than my norm size"
2.0,"Can't speak for overall comfort or durability as I'm sending this back. Sized for very small wrists, not for men."
2.0,Fitment was quite a bit off.
2.0,"Fell apart a month after I bought it. Sadly, it’s a very fashionable watch, but the leather connecting to the watch face ripped off and I couldn’t fix it."
2.0,The jewlery is supposed to give the illusion of working gears. The placement of the gears in my earrings gave the impression of a rushed job.
2.0,Product left a rash around my face
2.0,This belt is barely more rigid than my walmart $10 dollar belt....  I expected much more for the price!  Live and learn I guess..
2.0,Returning; ears are off center and it looks weird.  Tried wearing he headband off center too but that hurt.
2.0,"Poor quality product. Too see-through, size does not fit me well - not because of the size, just the overall fit. feels cheap."
2.0,"there's no shape to this dress, it's like a pillow case, not allowing for curves."
2.0,Poorly made .
2.0,"I'm 5'2 barely maybe 210lbs, ordered a 3x and it was too large and easy too long.  Haven't ordered any other styles or name brands other than What Waist in which there's no comparison at all.  I would've ordered a smaller size but I chose to try a different brand.  Good luck"
2.0,Super cute but the material is very thin
2.0,This shirt has no give and is not that long. Not true to size.
2.0,I’m a 32D & thought I could make this work but I’m feeling a little puzzled. I’ll be taking it to my tailor I think so it isn’t a complete wash. Definitely for *heavy* chested ladies looking for cute dresses!<br />Went to get it altered & it’s made in a way that made alteration really difficult. It was around $50 so I’m returning the dress. Seller doesn’t pay for return shipping so I paid money for nothing.
2.0,The paint on some of the glasses transferred to my skin.
2.0,I like the product but the straps come out very fast in less than a month of purchase.
2.0,"Cute style but dress is listed as Material: 95% Cotton, 5% Spandex but is actually 95% polyester and 5% spandex."
2.0,Cute but too small. I would have to order up at least 6 months or so.
2.0,La cualidad es buena pero no es el mismo tamaño que esperaba.
2.0,"The lenses have already started peeling the coating. We bought them sept 3, 2018 and I'm writing this Oct 12, 2018. They lasted 1 month."
2.0,"PRO:<br />- Soft<br />- Color is mostly accurate (on the pink set)<br /><br />CONS:<br />***Pink color is see-through***<br />You can see the panel behind the buttons which looks like an ugly rectangle right in the middle of your torso. The shorts are also very see-through, even with light underwear on.<br />***Shorts too small/short***<br />I bought a similar style of PJ's in an XL by several diff. brands to compare, and these shorts fit more like a Large than an XL.<br />***Shorts hug butt/legs***<br />Maybe some people like that style, but I like my pajama shorts to be roomy in the legs<br />***Awkward sleeve seam***<br />The sleeves have this one little thread (or maybe two little threads?) that is meant to help them stay folded up on the ends, but it doesn't actually work. So, you're left with a sagging, awkward look. Maybe you could iron the sleeves into place, but I'm not one to iron my pajamas.<br />***Arrived very wrinkled***<br />Even though the PJ's were folded neatly in the bag, they were very wrinkly. This wasn't an issue with similar pajamas I ordered from other brands, and it made me concerned that the material might just be more prone to wrinkles."
2.0,"Cute shorts... but snug in thigh. Mine arrived with large hole in leg area... was ripped prior to delivery. In a conspicuous area, that will be difficult to repair. Since from China post... returns too complicated. Not impressed."
2.0,I got one pair black and one pair grey and on both pair one leg is slightly tighter and shorter than each paired match it can be seen on the stripes as well... 2 stars for comfort when I fold them down but defeats the purpose of buying the over knee
2.0,These pants aren't of the greatest quality. They aren't very thick but feel like they may rip if pulled to hard. I'm very displeased with these.
2.0,"Comfortable! Fit is as expected, but quality is disappointing.  Thin fabric that lacks modesty.  Not for active use.  Not for anyone looking for compression or support fit.  Not ideal for yoga because of its thin material- back to the modesty issue."
2.0,Cute bag but the plastic coating is cracking and breaking off after only a few months of use.
2.0,They look great BUT..... they are unfortunately plastic and will get stuck constantly. I have one stuck in my ear currently and it’s just not turning at all (and I on purposely didn’t screw it on all the way because I knew it would get stuck) however maybe you’ll have more luck than me. Again they look great!
2.0,Beautiful but tiny!
2.0,"Purchased, good packaging even includes the tools, the bracelet it self could not stand up to light wear. I mean I only wore the band to church and now stuck with a band that is no good pin came out of the top clasp won't stay in. ( where the Fitbit comes together with the band) Will say overall cosmetics it is nice, got lots of compliments but quality of workmanship is not there. Good thing I felt the pin poke me$135 Fitbit getting lost because of a pin is not good."
2.0,"This shirt is not all bad but it does NOT fit as expected. It is too small. The style is cute and would be flattering to a full figured body type if it were accurately sized. The color was pretty and as expected.  The material is soft, stretchy, and comfortable. I was uncomfortable in it due to it being too snug and clinging to my curves more than I would prefer. In the Amazon photo, it appeared to be more loose fitting. I was unable to wear it but I would have liked it very much if the fit had been as pictured and expected. Therefore, I can only give it 2 stars. If you order this item, be sure to order up a size or two for an appropriate fit."
2.0,They say it wont be too big or too small but its HUGE. Its probably the size of a large. I wish there was an option for a small. Looks like I'm stuck with it until I buy another one though as my old (original) one broke. They really should label it as a large.
2.0,I thought that it was made of better material
2.0,Just looks cheap.  And the material is super thin
2.0,They are really cute looking but the 28 didn't even fit my size 4 skinny friend
2.0,Like the make of them but checking the size chart comparing and what I order did no mach.
2.0,Would it be possible to exchange for an xlarge?
2.0,"Warm and useful this winter, but there is no elasticity to these.  I liked them for weekend days at home, but for work days they bothered me too much because they were always falling down. Sizes 6-12? I should have known better... that's not how socks fit a foot!"
2.0,"Very see through and very small, I wear a 6-8, 5’4” 160lbs. I ordered a medium. Wasn’t going on. So I summoned my 13 year old daughter. She’s a 00-0 in jeans, 5’5” and 116lbs. The medium fit her just perfectly. She’s going to wear it over swimsuits. I’d order up two sizes if I ordered it again."
2.0,Very small and shrinks even more when you wash them.
2.0,cute doesnt look exactly like the pics and is also see through
2.0,This product is not what I expected the fit is awful and the sewing on the top is horrible.
2.0,"DIDN'T LIKE IT. DISAPPOINTED IN THE SETTING, COLOR AND QUALITY  OF THE PENDENT..  IF I WERE TO GET A CHOCOLATE DIAMOND NOW IT WOULD BE A RING.."
2.0,Doesn’t look as great as the picture.  Looks kind of cheap.
2.0,Material is comfortable.  Not long enough
2.0,Fit is way off returned them
2.0,"Cute dress but the velvet which is supposed to cover the boobs at the side does not cover it completely, so about 1/4 of my boobs are seen through the lace.  Otherwise the fit of the dress is fine. I'm 5ft5&quot; 190 lbs got a XL."
2.0,Color was nice. Unfinished hem that was disappointing
2.0,Product received versus represented online is different in color and style. Not happy with this purchase.
2.0,"The material is thin, but doesn’t quite drape. The cut is a bit larger than similar items. (I ordered a large, which should fit for my normal size 12, but it’s baggy rather than drapey.) There’s an inexplicable “notch” sewn into the sleeve hem, which doesn’t show in the pictures: it looks like the sewing machine caught too much fabric."
2.0,Nice size bag however the bag and straps are very thin.
2.0,This dress is not flattering at all!! It doesn’t look like the picture very much.
2.0,Broke first time i used it
2.0,Cheap material and the chest cut out was wayyy to big
2.0,The fit of the glasses just didn’t feel right. They did not seem like oversized glasses like the description said. They also seemed a lot rounder on then I imagined. The quality is ok. I will be returning.
2.0,"Fresh out the box it looks amazing. The bottom fits me perfectly, but the top teeth are way to wide( for people like me who have small teeth). The instructions were simple but manage mess it up. To make a long story short, one mistake can mess the whole thing up beyond repair to were they are not even wearable anymore and u have to wait a couple extra days for them to come in, just buy two pair, trust me."
2.0,"Good length, but these pants run very small and tight through the thighs."
2.0,My 13YO niece says it fits huge.
2.0,Ok but the hem on one unraveled in a week
2.0,The quality of the stones and silver didn't meet my expectations.  I returned it.
2.0,Although I received only one even if I have ordered 2 of them (even that one is bit damaged). I was in need so I did not return it for replacement or refund.<br />I started using it holds about 3-4 cards and driving license and some money but that's limit to it. you can not fit more  since it became de shaped . As for price what you get what you pay for.
2.0,No strap was included
2.0,Sent this back. The pockets were down the side seam which gave the appearance of extra large hips. Loved the color though.
2.0,"Hard to get on, way too small"
2.0,"Cute...but very cheap, don't waste your money. The side zipper broke already."
2.0,The color was off.
2.0,"too large and poor quality,pockets are too high"
2.0,"Purchased as a birthday gift. When my daughter unscrewed the backs, one of the pearls became loose."
2.0,The material is nice but I should have zoomed in on the picture- there is a big ugly seam down the FRONT of this dress. Badly sewn I might add. I'm 5'6 size 12 so I got the large. The length was perfect but it was kind of tentish. :/
2.0,"Seems well made, but too small. I'm a large but like to wear shirts a bit over sized so I went up and still way too small."
2.0,Broke the first time i used it.
2.0,"these ear rings are pretty cool, they look good but they are kinda small. they are cheaply made and come in a cheapy box but i guess u get what your paying for."
2.0,I had this dress for about a month. Absolutely loved it! The zipper ripped so I was only able to wear it one or two times. I definitely wasted my money.....
2.0,The cut leaves a lot to be desired. The crotch area is too narrow and does not provide the proper support; the rear cut does not provide  enough coverage and there doesn’t seem to be any elastic around the leg openings. All in all not really an ideal product. Disappointed.
2.0,"Material was see through at the top , arms fit fine until at the bottom and was too tight."
2.0,"Not what I expected, will have to return"
2.0,It’s totally see thru mesh and the fabric feels very cheap. I wouldn’t recommend.
2.0,Didn't wear it even a hour before a crystal fell out leaving a sharp piece that cut my leg. Had to use wire cutters to cut that piece off. So now it has one less crystal on it. But other than that its pretty
2.0,used for my locs product quality was ok
2.0,"I like the colors it fitss well except the arms are so tight I can't wear the shirt.  I ordered an xxl and the shirt is fine, but the are more like a large."
2.0,"Really cute bag, but it seems I got a faulty one. The stitching is coming loose by the zipper and it's too late to return. Otherwise it's a great bag."
2.0,"I'm a 30F/32E; this didn't come close to fitting me.  It was incredibly uncomfortable and I couldn't imagine wearing it, even if it did fit.  I returned it for a refund."
2.0,"The ring itself is gorgeous! If only it fit... MUCH larger than expected. I ordered a size 6 and the ring I recieved is more true to a size 8. Really disappointing. I also noticed that there was no real silver stamp in the ring as pictured, so I can't go and have it resized bc it might not be real silver."
2.0,It looks good just needs better making the sides are not straight but still looks good oh and star is straight its not curved like the pic
2.0,"Just wish it had instructions , it difficult to figure out."
2.0,Broke the first time my daughter wore it!  She was so upset!
2.0,Great shirt - way to small
2.0,"It would have been exactly what i needed, except for the fact the entire right sleeve was torn from shoulder to wrist. So it's useless to me."
2.0,"Good quality, but received a toddler size large. Not sure if that was a mistake or their sizing description was off. Reread the item details and it stated it was a Big Boys, not toddler"
2.0,"It’s a cute jacket, but the fabric is very cheap. There were a lot of strings and loose threads. One side of the jacket wasn’t stictched all the way too. I will wear it, but I am going to have to cut all the loose strings and finish the stitching on the bottom. In the pictures you can see one side is sewn all the way and the other isn’t. I got an XL and it fits well. The size chart is accurate."
2.0,Product looks awesome but is very small. XXL is a small . Also it costs way more to return then you paid for the items.
2.0,"This purse is ok ,but it was listed with the conceal carry purses and it is not. It's misleading when you type in conceal carry purse and this one popped up!"
2.0,"From a distance, this is a nice looking watch. Up close, however... Well, you get what you pay for.<br /><br />It feels cheap too. Like something that would come out if a vending machine.<br /><br />The biggest issue, for me, is the face itself. The background is a cheap, pixelated, photo. Improving that alone, would make a big difference."
2.0,"I really like this swim suit love the color and material, but I wish I would have gotten a bigger size. The size charts didn't match so I had a hard time chosen the right size for me. The top fits me perfectly, but the bottoms are too tight and too short. Also some of the blue navy color is bleeding through the white stripes.<br /><br />Pros: design<br /><br />Cons: Size chart not correct<br />  Blue color bleeds thru the white stripes"
2.0,"The strange thing is, the white pair fit perfectly and the black pair was a whole inch smaller. Both pairs were size 9. I have two other pairs of these flip flops and all were the same size except the black pair was a lot smaller and I can't wear them. I do not know what happened."
2.0,"The photo is misleading as you can barely see any purple color at all, I was disappointed"
2.0,Wore once and it came apart.
2.0,I ordered this to wear to a vow renewal and couldn’t wear it.  The sleeves were tight on my arms and it was see through. I had no use for a sheer dress.
2.0,Cute vest and I love the material but the edges roll up so it ends up being too small across the chest.
2.0,Material looked cheap.
2.0,It says they are expandable but they are NOT! Otherwise I like color and lightness but worry about a big trip with no extra space.
2.0,"We love keens but dislike these shoes very much. My daughter had an average foot, not skinny, not chubby, and wears a straight 11. The 11 was so large on her foot that it was laughable. I returned them and ordered a 10, a whole size TOO SMALL and they *sort of fit*. I ended up taking out the inserts that came with the shoe and using A combination of dr sholes inserts and craft foam instead. They are fitting OK now but we shall see as she walks around. Super bummed Bc these shoes really are the perfect shoe for her. No straps which she refuses to wear anymore. (Previously had worn the Monica for the past 3 summers). 2 stars Bc 1: cute 2: color. Otherwise. Meh. Bummed. Order multiple sizes and plan to modify the inserts."
2.0,The mask was a little small for an adult face
2.0,"My 12 year old daughter wore this dress ONE time to church for 2, maybe 3 hours. One patch became somewhat fuzzy and discolored another spot has a hole. Not sure if the hole was there upon delivery and I missed it or it happened during the wear. Either way, unacceptable. She was at church sitting, not engaging in heavy physical activity."
2.0,"The material is extremely thin, and almost see through. These will not keep a child warm. I returned."
2.0,It should be sturdier for the price!
2.0,Ita costume jewelry.  Big blingy and serves its purpose.
2.0,"size ordered is not fitting, correct size"
2.0,"I ordered black, yellow and green. The colors are vibrant and beautiful.  The material is thick and not see through. If you are short like myself (5'3, 157lbs), dress will be too big/long (I ordered a small). No way to make it fit, which is disappointing because I actually like the dress."
2.0,The briefer men's cotton boxer briefs are soft and durable 100% cotton.  This is one of the most comfortable boxer briefs that I have found and are spacious.  The draw back is they tend to run large to size and offer little to no support.  I would recommend trying a size smaller.
2.0,Need to order two size up if you want to buy it.
2.0,There where smudges all inside on the metallic parts inside.
2.0,I returned this dress because it was too small and had poor finishing.
2.0,"these are much smaller than pictured, also, the seam along the edge became uncomfortable after awhile."
2.0,"Very thin fabric, you can totally see anything you wear underneath (I bought the bright blue color). Stitching around waste elastic came undone after wearing for a few hours. Not worth the price. This is like dollar store quality. The only thing going for it is the style is very cute."
2.0,"Doesn't fit right, material is so light."
2.0,"Two stars because I found hair, tangled, in one of the hair bands. I will not use it and am very disappointed."
2.0,The earrings and necklace turned colors after 1 time wearing it.
2.0,Very misleading
2.0,"Runs very small, cute pattern but pretty thin and tight. Wasn't comfortable at all to work out in."
2.0,I have a xl to xxl head I can put it on but had take it apart to wear it.
2.0,Prongs that brace the stones are shoddy. Returned the first one bc it arrived with a stone missing. They did however replace it promptly. A definite costume jewelry piece.
2.0,Broken on first day
2.0,Cute but the edge ruffles were itchy
2.0,Very cute but a little small which made it hard to put on.
2.0,I ordered an XL. Not an XL in a kid's size.
2.0,Not for women with a big Bum like me. Wouldnt Zip.
2.0,"Neck band is too tight, and there isn't any type of extension. Was very disappointed that I just can't wear this item."
2.0,"3 time trying, orderd a med, large and now an extra large and no luck getting any of them over my mid thigh. I wear a size 10 that should not be more than an xlarge but apparently I would need a 3x in this item which they dont sell."
2.0,"This sweater is super cute however the quality is poor. After one wear, all of the silver rings that the lace is laced through, detached from the sweater. This left an unfinished edge to the sweater which is now unraveling. I don't think I'll be able to wear it again."
2.0,This material is really awful. It’s like the material biking clothes are made of. Some sort of spandex. Such a shame......very disappointing.
2.0,"The stick on‘s do not stick on. Especially on rounded surfaces. I do not have any glasses that have flat surfaces on them. Unless you do,do not waste your time or money."
2.0,"The design concept is cute and appropriate for human pup play. The fit however is too much like an actual muzzle.  It’s hard to speak/bark because the mouth is small, there’s an extra flap that sits on the bridge of the human nose that’s unnecessary.  A size chart might help customers decide if this is the right fit for them before purchase."
2.0,Comes very small. Not worth the money
2.0,"These are adorable but sadly, way too small. It seems this is a theme for Native shoes. I learned my lesson and didn’t buy in advance this time after getting stuck out of the return window when they wouldn’t fit on my son’s feet. I thought these may be better since they are fabric but there is zero stretch and I could not get them on, despite him still fitting in size 6 in most shoes."
2.0,I wish the sleeves were made wider at the top.
2.0,"Cheaply made, poorly sewn, cool design"
2.0,Looks cheap.  Poor quality
2.0,"I was sooo excited for this delivery. But completely not worth it. Bunny was broken, buttons loose AND the eye on the back of bunny was missing."
2.0,I ended up trading this Item.  I didn't trust the size chart. Too bad because they were very cute and soft
2.0,If you are looking for a black embossed bag please keep in mind the grey/silver spots you see in the picture.  They are very prominent on the bag itself.  It was more grey than black and this made it appear worn and not professional.<br />I returned it.
2.0,Cute but if your curvy like me it will probably make u look pregnant.
2.0,Looks great but not breathable and the head strap isn’t long at all. I have to add Velcro to extend it to allow my son to wear it this year. If not then I have to send it back and not be able to get him a replacement in time for Halloween. No idea why they have such a tiny strap for the head. I’m a very little woman and it barely fits me but my son is as big as a grown man. Disappointed because he was so excited to get it.<br />I have prime shipping so we got the mask the very next day after ordering it. Crazy fast
2.0,Size isn’t true! Order up like 2 sizes.
2.0,Fabric is very thin. Too short. Color is great<br />I have 2. Both came out of the first wash with holes in the pocket and one also in the back yolk of one. I’m repairing holes and keeping but will not order again
2.0,Color is too orangey.Wanted red. I was also hoping that the fit at the bottom of the pants would be tighter. Returning them.
2.0,eh.underwhlemed. not blush colored more like a coral
2.0,It's cute. But not real. It's appears to be a piece of glass colored green.
2.0,Did not fit around my glasses as advertised. Could not use them
2.0,Works on and off upon receipt.  Never been able to keep it working .
2.0,Was very wrinkled.
2.0,I just did not have a good experience with this.  It was too long for my torso and really didn't feel like I could ever wear it for longer than an hour.  This just was not a good brand for me.
2.0,These are cute but pinch my daughters ears too tightly and she won’t wear them
2.0,"Price is great. Fit is great. The smell of plastic is horrible. Bought about three weeks ago from their site. Thought the smell would go away after wearing and washing them, but currently they still stink."
2.0,"Cute outfit for sure! The Miss Sassy Pants shirt is adorable, but the pants are not. I received the outfit with the top in size 90 (12-18 mos) as ordered, but the pants were size 100 which is not what I ordered and are too large for my petite 14 mo child. I requested and quickly received a replacement 2 pc outfit — but again in conflicting sizes. Perhaps the seller purposely sells the outfit with the pants one size larger? Not worth the trouble to return and secure a refund plus the gift card that was used to partially pay for the outfit, so I’m keeping the outfit with little satisfaction."
2.0,The product that came was not the color shown in the description online
2.0,Super upset I’m 5’4 and these look like they will fit my 5 yr old they are cute but going back
2.0,Were nice at first but the balls fell off within a few hours of putting it in.
2.0,"I originally bought this thinking it was a great thing to make sure my kiddo kept his mask from falling to the ground.  I like it, but the device to shorten it came right off, so I had to make a knot where I want it so it’s not so long.  Still works just not as they had intended it."
2.0,much smaller than it should have been.
2.0,These shoes fit well and looked great but my son only had them for two weeks before they started to come apart.
2.0,"Material is cheap, but for that price it’s expected."
2.0,When putting on I noticed a tare at the seam was at bottom would’ve been covered up but definitely not happy about it
2.0,Too small...the size is not true.
2.0,"From the picture you'd assume this skirt drapes beautifully and has a fullness to it. You'd be wrong. The dress looks like a child's ballet tutu, but without the volume yet all of the awkward shape. Even though I ordered the floor-length version the hem barely skimmed the floor."
2.0,Cracked  after dropping only a couple times
2.0,It's a really nice piece. Very pretty. Sadly it hurts my wrist so I can't wear it on my wrist like I wanted to.
2.0,Nice material but makes me look bigger than I am and at the same time a little tight around the armpits.
2.0,"I wanted to like this skirt.  In the photos it looks so elegant and lovely.  The fit was fine.  I'm 5'1 and 135 lbs and the medium size was fine.  The midi length is on the longer side - it was definitely more high ankles than mid-calf, but that's not necessarily a negative.<br /><br />The gold and black stripes worked better in theory than in practice and the fabric itself was nice enough.  Two negatives are that the bottom isnt' hemmed, which gives me concerns about the longevity of this skirt and that the fabric combined with the elastic waistband made my partner ask me what had caused me to give up.  In theory, I love the stylish gold and black stripes and pleats.  Sadly it comes together more as comfortable for grandma rather than elegant and stylish."
2.0,They are very comfy warm gloves but they ripped on the second day of wearing them
2.0,"I purchased this for an office Christmas party. I was going for the casual/dressy feel; the material was cheap and noisy like a very cheap highway motel shower curtain. The skirt made me look bigger than I am. I am a curvy woman with a small waist, hips and ample behind. I looked boxy! On top of that the pattern was not even the same. I had this sent overnight therefore, I had to wear it. So I accompanied it with a jean jacket  to hide how wide I looked, a crisp white blouse just like the model with a gold necklace and large hoop earrings. I tried to &#34;Make It Work!&#34; as Tim Gunn says."
2.0,"I pretty much don't like anything about this. I don't think the fabric is soft as others have just arrived, I felt like it was cheap feeling. I'm a size small, so I guess I should've figured that this might be too big, but it's bigger then too big, it's incredibly sloppy and won't stay up on my shoulders based on the unstructured cut, so even if I wanted to wear it, I can't. For $30, I probably won't send it back, I'll just give it to to goodwill, but I should've known better. You get what you pay for. I genuinely don't understand how people gave it as many stars as they did. And I am not an incredibly picky person, I don't spend a lot of money on clothes."
2.0,"This mask fits well, but is so rough. I also bought a child one. That is very soft. I’m disappointed in the adult mask."
2.0,beads fall off easily but was great for the one outfit I needed it for for that day. One time use.
2.0,I did as state used a piece of paper and measured the piece of paper the rings I received are 2 sizes bigger. The ring set comes with sizer and I measured finger is actually a 10
2.0,"One pair broke right out of the box, very adorable sets of clip on earring but the quality is so cheap. My daughter complain it hurts her went wearing for a few minutes."
2.0,"The socks  are very well made,  non-binding and soft to my surprise. But I am returning  them, because they do have cooling and itchy feel."
2.0,SUPER THIN material!!!
2.0,I like the product but was too small.
2.0,"I normally wear xs, ordered M and it fits! However, the previous reviews are true - sleeves are way too short and it's too high waisted. Still a very lovely coat, just wish it fitted better"
2.0,"They are cheap glasses the screw popped out leaving them unusable. Didn't waste any money, but not buying again."
2.0,"Yet again, the clothes issue hits me on here: I order my size or a size larger, and the garment they send is way too small. I feel like a sausage in this thing, and I ordered a size larger this time. No luck. Unless you're a super-rail-thin little guy, this won't fit at its listed size. Trust me: Order two sizes larger and maybe it'll be comfortable. The only exception is muscle guys who want to have a skin-tight shirt. This will do the trick if that's your goal.<br /><br />Two stars. Sizing chart is absolutely wrong and material feels slick and weird."
2.0,"Cute bootie when new, my little sister loved them. However, the glitter immediately starts falling off and as creases form from walking in them, it peels and flakes off in chunks. The underlying material is very thin, the glitter is caked on to give a kind of shell to the bootie. I bought these 2.5 months ago and they look terrible now."
2.0,More like a shirt! Returned!
2.0,"The glasses themselves are sexy and pretty, the colors are nice. However, the glasses are heavy and hurt to wear. They gave me a headache, hurt my nose, and left red marks on either side of my nose as well. Cannot recommend."
2.0,I wish there was a better sizing chart. The pants were huge in 2x. The legs were extra big for no reason.
2.0,They work as gloves but the stiching is wonky and the fingers on one of the hands twists almost all the way around. Also looks like some of the stitching is wearing down after only 2 weeks of use. The velcro also comes undone relatively regularly.<br /><br />I will say they don't get very sweaty but I don't think they're gonna hold up very long. Spend the extra few dollars and get a pair that lasts.
2.0,I like to design cool mask this is really thin and they don't feel like they protect anything I had to wear another mask on the knee thick
2.0,Paid $20 for these and they came with a Marshall’s tag on them for $14.99. They also left marks on my sons feet and he acted as though they were very uncomfortable.
2.0,"Not good quality at all.  Cheaply made.  Great graphics though, fell apart after first wash.  Ron away from this."
2.0,Odd fit because of structured cups. Doesn't hold  at all when doing high intensity workouts. Cute though.
2.0,"I bought the card cubby for my wife, because she has a yellow one that is wore out.  She says it is not built the same as her old one.  when she puts her cards in the cover does not snap and it bends the indexing cards over.  The flap measurement are smaller than the old flap.  She was excited to receive it, but dissapointed as the quality of the product.  I am planning on returning it, but i have never had to return anything i have bought from amazon.  So I will figure out how to return the product and do not know if i will reorder one."
2.0,Day 1 and the blue bead has left blue coloring on my wrist. I expect better quality. Hasn't been wet so it shouldn't be bleeding color already.
2.0,It looks like a super cheap peace of fabric.
2.0,"Order medium, received something that was large to extra large in size. Really disappointed because the sweater felt really nice."
2.0,"Very poorly made jacket. I would have returned it, but grand child loved it."
2.0,"The strip of sparkly material around the side is not properly affixed to the sole, has glue visible at spots and doesn't quite reach all around. The slipper is nice, but that It looks bad due the visible glue and incomplete strip."
2.0,Dress is shorter than expected. Ordered one in Orange from the same page but with hot touch brand that was a better quality fabric and length. Didn't care for pastel brand. Somewhat see though.
2.0,The neckline is the dress is extremely high. Looks nothing like the photo. The material is heavy but very soft. Returned it cuz it had hair all over the dress! It was used before it got to me! Ew!
2.0,"Glad to hear from you! On the third or so wearing, the left stem snapped without any undue pressure of any kind!<br />Stems appear to be too thin and/or fragile.<br />Otherwise, I loved the case. :&#62;) :&#62;/<br />Will I get a replacement pair of 3.5 power?!<br />Really think I should!?<br /><br />Larry M-Mc"
2.0,Elastic stretches out easily and my girl dosent even have chunky legs
2.0,"Not my quality or style, so I returned it to the maker."
2.0,Runs very small. Flimsy support for large boobs
2.0,Shirt long enough but the sleeves are short and the shorts are so short they can be boxers.  B.s. definitely not worth the money!
2.0,They’re too big for snake eyes piercing! Disappointed  :/
2.0,"Very thin and see threw, but it looks like the pictures but see threw. Getting returned tho. Wasn't too short."
2.0,Arms don't fit correctly!!! Sucks.
2.0,The glasses are very good quality. BUT the glasses are made for young people whose vision is good  If you are 50 or over the glasses will<br />not work for you.  The bright head lights will be bright except they will be more yellow.  The advertisement said the yellow street dividers will  extra clear.  They are the same.  I think the glasses might work for for people who are young and don' need them. If you are over 40 don't waste your  money. I watched so many shows about glasses to help at night. These glasses are not the answer.
2.0,The color is really pretty but it comes out the packaging and instantly tangles.... everything you do causes it to tangle. It was good for the purpose of Halloween. If you’re looking for something that you’ll get multiple uses out of.... this isn’t it.
2.0,"Not that great belt as it leaves impression when tied and wore after sometime, may be a day."
2.0,No...just...no.
2.0,"Sending it back, it looks like a tent.  Reasonably nice quality for the price, but the shape is not flattering.  For reference I am a size 12, 5'7&#34; and average weight."
2.0,plastic the hold the light to the belt broke off. Now you can't wear it. It broke when I was taking the belt off.
2.0,It looks like your getting 3 of them looking at the advertisements but there is only one really small one!
2.0,Cute but fragile. The flower screwed off the first day. Just be careful w it.
2.0,The cute is weird. The neckline wasn't like a picture and the bottom was cut too far up the thigh. It didn't feel right walking up stairs or trying to dance
2.0,Marked M fits more like a XS
2.0,I Don't know if it was the way it was packed. The Sweater looks nothing like the picture very out of shape and big i really don't have the time to send it back just will donate and wont order from this company again. I Expected a lot more and better quality.
2.0,"It's a beautiful top but it was way too big on me. After reading the reviews of everyone saying that its true to size, i ordered a XL cause I wear XL. Tried it on and it swallowed me. Order a size down if you want it to look perfect on you. 2 stars cause it was a beautiful top. Will save it for a Xmas present to my sister."
2.0,Looked much better on the website than it does in person. I'm giving it to my girlfriend on Valentine's Day and apologizing for the way it looks at the same time. Two stars because the description was actually correct.
2.0,The fabric on the skirt (white with floral pattern) is see through. It had to be returned due to this. the dress quality otherwise seems good and I may try a different color in the future.
2.0,It doesn't lay flat when you wear it as seen in the picture. It also definitely feels cheap but I guess you get what you pay for.
2.0,"UPDATED REVIEW:<br /><br />Original: Quick shipping, safely packaged, includes a nice roomy case.<br /><br />Update: While the above is still true, unfortunately the glasses fell apart shortly after purchase. I used them very seldom as it's been a gray winter. When not on, they are always in the protective case. Yet the other day, one of the arms literally disconnected from the glasses while wearing them, shortly after putting them on. They must have come unscrewed at some point...in their protective case, untouched. Cheap product, but sort of expected, proving again that you get what you pay for."
2.0,My head is small and the hat wobbles on my head. The strap that it comes with is useless. Will never use it.
2.0,It's a nicly made shirt but the measurements are way off. We ordered the size by what the measurement chart suggested. Yeah it's not even close to what my son needs. This is definitely not an adult men's small t-shirt. Will definitely be returning. I gave it 2 stars because it is a nice shirt.
2.0,Material wise. Not what I expect
2.0,These are huge. But I guess that’s expected for being 0-6months. But they won’t work for my newborn so I will probably be returning them.
2.0,Beautiful but cannot put them em the needle part is too big .
2.0,I’m not sure what the utility belt thing was for but it did not help you look sexy. The dress was fine but the belt looked like a military utility belt<br />That was extremely confusing to figure out.<br />After washing it once I couldn’t figure the dress out as it got tangled. I got a<br />Medium that for more like a large and just hung off my body and was not flattering.
2.0,"Cheap, thin, and way too long. Very disappointing."
2.0,I thought these would be perfect for my five year old but they were huge! Not sure if I missed something in the description or what but they are giant.
2.0,Watch band pinches
2.0,"Item came broke, waiting on a replacement"
2.0,Wore these once. It was super annoying how the adhesive folds over and sticks to itself. Maybe my thighs are too thick for it. Not sure
2.0,not a very good buy. the tip of the belt has started to unravel after only wearing for less than a month.
2.0,"Love the vibrant color and the fit. However, I'm disappointed because after just a couple times of wear (about 4 times) I discovered that holes had formed in the fabric along the backside seam."
2.0,"I was a bit disappointed,  since I would have to have a giraffe neck for people to be able to see the design on them.  they look good in the ad but they're only good to take a picture of them on the bed."
2.0,"They are super comfy. I do wish the legs were a little shorter though. I am 5'7"" and the legs drag on the ground under my heels and get soaked if it's even just sprinkling out. But super awesome for lounging around the house. ;-)<br />They do not last very long. The seams tear open pretty quickly (second pair within a month). I love the fit though. I've bought two pairs but probably won't get these again as I'm wasting my money from them giving out so fast."
2.0,"Huge dangles hanging off the chain - my fault, I should have looked at the measurements before purchasing.  I thought they were smaller and more delicate.  It was awful."
2.0,The material felt like a costume not regular clothes
2.0,I bought one size larger and it was super tight/form fitting.
2.0,fit me small was upset. i have thick hips.
2.0,Yes it looks like the photos but the material feels TERRIBLE!
2.0,The dress didn’t really look like the picture. I’m returning it.
2.0,Real nice and pretty  I love butterfly my baby passed few yrs ago and everytime I think of her I always see just 1 yellow butterfly. So when I saw this I was excited to buy and put her name on it. But an hour after I put it on I had a allergic reaction to it 😔 not sure why and also a few days later it started changing color. Guess I'll keep looking.
2.0,"This isn’t maternity. I think they consider them maternity because you can undue the buttons in the side as you grow, which  is shown in the picture but you have no idea that’s what it’s implying especially if you’re not looking for it. They’re cute but not maternity and you can wear them after baby is born."
2.0,"Charm is paper thin & not smooth on back & not stamped 14k & even thou chain is stamped, I don’t think the charm is real. They put a card in with necklace that’s supposed to certify it’s really gold but I’m still skeptical. It’s going back. I will keep looking for a more solid piece."
2.0,"My kids love crock type shoes,  and having them light up is a huge win!  We ordered two pairs and one shoe came to small and didn't light up.  So we exchanged it for a bigger size.  Both shoes stopped lighting up within 2 weeks. I think due to walking through snow and slush? So avoid water with them and they might last longer!  The seam also keeps falling off on some of the shoes so we have to keep gluing them. The normal crock type shoes we buy are only $6 so we won't but these ones again."
2.0,Tela muy transparente
2.0,"I liked the fabric, however they did not fit correctly.  They were too short in length and somewhat long in the crotch."
2.0,"This may just be a personal preference, but they’re way to large for me. And they don’t turn sideways to sit naturally with your face. They face forward at all times and it looks so weird to me"
2.0,"The stitching is very noticeable and the fabric is &#34;clothy&#34; , not silky and smooth like the picture appears. It also looks extremely &#34;sailor&#34; like in person. Not for me."
2.0,Legit fit my neighbors 12yr old.  Very disappointed
2.0,Beautiful watch but not for daily wear. The shimmer of the band wears off very easily. I’m so disappointed.
2.0,Not warm and cozy as I was hoping. I have some wool socks that are so comfy I just wanted some longer versions. The search continues...
2.0,"Once I got the clasp off, I could never snap it back on.  Returned it."
2.0,Disappointed. Didn’t read the information. Tiny
2.0,Quality was good. But failed to mention it was a tab fit. Did not want that.
2.0,It is very pretty but I already had a stone fall off so I don't wear it anymore didnt get to enjoy
2.0,Nothing like I thought it would be
2.0,I didn't like that the mask was thin but had pocket for a filter to be put in. They do give you two filters but it just feels weird.
2.0,These sweat pants aren’t worth $22. Maybe $10… I regret not sending them back. The inseam on the right leg is off. The material is a bit scratchy. They remind me of the irregular things that you would get a discount on at outlet stores or even cheap items you would find at a flea market.
2.0,Received broken with no logo on it. 2 stars because easy to return and get money back. Bracelet is really ugly when I see how it is supposed to be worn.
2.0,"This band fit my Versa Fitbit watch however, the pins you use to attach to the watch do not stay intact with the band when you disconnect from the watch, they fall out.  On top of that problem, the lever on one of the pins broke off the first time I disconnected it with the watch.  I can find other pins to place in the band but too aggravating to deal with if they are going to fall out every time.  I find myself not using the band due to this inconvenience.  The only reason I rated any stars at all is because the band is very pretty and appears to be well made except for the pin issue."
2.0,Feels cheap and looks cheap. Neck is huge and shirt runs small.
2.0,Definitely runs large. And the fabric is not as the first few photos show… will be returning
2.0,They all have a bump if thread in the lining . I tried to change my label becaue I can’t get to a FEDEX to return but no one answers
2.0,Was disappointed.  Had to glue one of them back together. Glad I didn't pay much for them.
2.0,"Although cute and unique with the gold chain, this suit did not fit well whatsoever. The swim bottom barely covered my front or back. The top was literally two inches wide and barely covered my chest. Also it was a total pain to put on with all the ties. Ended up returning."
2.0,"The box is incredible, but de sunglasses are from the worst quality.<br />Too bad, didn't saw the other reviews which could help me avoiding this purchase.<br /><br />But the price is cheap."
2.0,broke after 2 wears
2.0,The band would have been great if they sent the actual color that it is being advertised as. In the their picture it looks more pink and purples but what I got is like brown and golden with barely any touches of pink let alone purple. Eh. It’s fine.
2.0,This was much smaller than the size guide indicated. Also did not look anything like the pic except it was black.
2.0,"Ring is pretty enough but my finger has turned green the third time I wear it, despite taking it off to wash my hands and being careful with creams and lotions."
2.0,I love the color and out fit but it’s to small around my hips. YALL have no othe size like this
2.0,"The shirt is really cute. Material see through but not too bad. Color was a pretty brigjt red. The disappointment was the sizing. I ordered size XL. I am a 10/12 at 5'8. I decided to go bigger XL over to have a more relaxed look. The material has no stretch at all, even getting it over my head was a chore. Once on the area in the waist fit but EVERY where else was tight, like don't sneeze or sigh tight. I returned the shirt without a problem."
2.0,"I bought these sunglasses, to wear over my regular glasses. They do not fit over my glasses. Disappointed..... upside, they are cute and they did come in an awesome fabric bag."
2.0,"These are great! It is the first time that I have tried this type of earring. I will say that they are very light and comfortable once they are in and my husband really liked the look of them. The only issue that I had was with some slipping but only on the right side. I pinched them and that seemed to work. Other than that they are beautiful!<br /><br />Edit 11/2/17<br />After approximately 3 wearings, both of the earrings literally snapped in half. I was so disappointed because they are beautiful."
2.0,The pins themselves are beautiful and a nice size. However I've had continued trouble with the tack break off or being finicky when I've tried to attach them to things.
2.0,Missing neck strap...
2.0,I wear my slippers inside. I live in Michigan and right now it's cold so my slips are always on while I'm at home. The lining on the inside is separating from the sides and loose thread are showing up a lot. Now I'm no slipper connoisseur but I'd have to say these were a disappointing product and I wouldn't recommend unless $5 or less. Save your money.
2.0,I could have bought better with another company. Hard to find a good quality tummy control panty that provides comfort and a contoured fit.
2.0,I order up a size based on chart and it was too big under arms for me.
2.0,Over all the product seems nice but in reality the umbrella is not very well made 2 of the umbrella arms broke and the rivits holding the umbrella snapped of and that was the end of the umbrella. Ive only had the umbrella for 2 months
2.0,"The quality is not that great, feels kind of cheap, but my mother-in-law loved it. She wants to add more charms to it and I'm not quite sure if that's  possibe so I'm thinking about buying a Pandora bracelet and somehow moving the boxer charm to the other bracelet. It also fit ridiculously huge and would slide up and down my whole forearm. Besides that, the style is cute. I could not find a better boxer charm anywhere."
2.0,"On the very first wash, the bandana had strings unraveling on all four sides. Hand wash only or they will start unraveling. Otherwise, they are larger and work better as a bandana if the smaller ones won't fit your head."
2.0,Shirt is cute but at least 2 sizes to small unfortunately.
2.0,Very disproportionate. Made for a Barbie doll and not a plus size gal.  Returned it.
2.0,"They did not fit properly, they showed and would not stay on the foot. Seller said they were going to send something and never did. They did not request the product be returned but I can't wear them."
2.0,Mine got broken and need to return back.
2.0,Most sashes have a triangular cut in the back of the neck to avoid it sliding off. This did not and I had to worry about it all graduation.
2.0,"Not a big fan. But, for the price I will probably just donate the item. Very thin material. Runs a little small"
2.0,"It runs small, but if you order a size up, it's a good basic t-shirt."
2.0,"Very pretty, but after wearing for a few hours my neck was cherry pink. Hard to get the color off. I will keep, but only wear with a layer of dark clothing underneath."
2.0,"After just a couple of washes, they are pulling already and not as warm as I expected for fleece lined leggins"
2.0,Was nearly paper thin. Wasn't really what I thought it would be. I ended up wearing it one time then threw it in to the goodwill pile. Didn't fit right either.
2.0,"I ordered the medium and it fits just a little big.  It's a great design, cheap fabric and poor quality sewing and pieces of yarn hanging out. Bottom of sweater has no seam (no hem). I would not buy from this company again."
2.0,"Good jacket, just too big for me and they have limited sizes, ie no medium"
2.0,This jacket was designed by someone who has never seen an adult female body. I'm 5'7 and 130. It made me look like a linebacker wearing a horrible belly shirt.
2.0,The shoes are super cute but not even close to being accurate in size. Bummed I didn't check them earlier as these were supposed to be a birthday gift.
2.0,One wash and the design got absolutely shredded. Didn’t think I had to do anything special besides flipping it inside out but now it’s an at home shirt cus I can’t wear it out this way
2.0,"It's cheaply made, and the pattern is not like the picture. Mine had too much yellow in it. I wanted mine to be oversized like the picture, but it runs pretty small. Mine also has developed a hole at the seam on the point of the V-neck after 2 wears."
2.0,"I normally wear a 36DD bra. I ordered a larger size than I thought that I needed (XL) because I wanted to have a comfortable fit, and it was so tight that I couldn't get it on over my head. I had to send it back."
2.0,Looks cheap ... but the dangle effect is nice.
2.0,"If you don’t want a bunch of silver/galena in your snuffer bottle, get ready to spend entirely too much time picking it out of your pan. Yes, there’s gold too, but there’s far less than the other junk…"
2.0,Ended up needing a grey dress and couldn't  find one local for a good price. You get what you pay for here: it looks nice but the fabric is incredibly cheap and stiff and scratchy.
2.0,Not fitted at all
2.0,Was to small for my daughter and she is very slender but it was to tight.
2.0,not at all like the pic. would not buy again
2.0,"These where 15 too small and missing buckles for my son that is nine years old, but the size 16 fit my 11years old just fine"
2.0,Strange material and the waist is really high.
2.0,Was a little small
2.0,"Cute, thoughit broke a few minutes after putting it on when my baby grabbed it. Chain is weak."
2.0,Way too short even though it was cute and well made. Had to return.
2.0,It's impossible to get this thing to stay on my ear! Though I guess you get what you pay for when it comes to this product.
2.0,"This scarf was not as large as expected and the fabric was very thin.  Unfortunately, I had to return it."
2.0,Returned because it was too rigid.  Because it is very thin that made it uncomfortable.  It is very pretty though.
2.0,"This suit does not look anything like the photo. I was hoping other reviews were off, but they are pretty darn accurate about mis-matched sizes. I wear a small-medium in most everything. I am a size 4. I accidentally ordered the size &#34;10&#34; and thought, uh oh, that will be too big. Wrong. The bottom was a bit large but would have worked. The top was tight and ill-fitting. It made me look like a stuffed sausage. I am fairly petite. The quality of the suit seemed fine. The fabric was thick and sewed correctly. But that top. Wrong on so many levels. The photo is very deceiving. But, I love the color. Very sad that I had to return it."
2.0,"No noticeable improvement in vision. Lighter at night, but not clearer"
2.0,"They were comfortable and not too hot, but these are the itchiest things I've ever put on my body."
2.0,"They. Were nice. Out of packaging,however the color turned after 2 weeks."
2.0,Great material but I’m 5’8” and it’s to short.
2.0,"Not comfortable. Too long and tight even though I ordered up a size. Felt very hot, not a breathable fabric. Would not buy again."
2.0,Top is longer in the front to accommodate a tummy.. This is more like a maternity top! The straps are very short causing it to come up to high in the armpit.  Would not recommend!
2.0,"This wasn't near as flattering in real life as it is on the model (and ain't that always the truth?)  But still, I'm 5'6, 130lbs usually wear a 4/6 in a dress - and this fit - sort of- but the sleeves and bust area were too tight under the armpits.  Sent it back."
2.0,"WAY too small! I ordered a medium, guess I should’ve got a large. I am 130 and 5’5"
2.0,Top is way to short and way to open in the back...couldn't figure out what to do with ties
2.0,"the finish is not shiny at all,it looks worn."
2.0,Bought these for granddaughter who didn’t want to pierce ears and they did not stay on even after holding for quite some time.
2.0,"I like the designs and colors.  They will not hold my glasses for more than 5-10 minutes (being generous), without sliding down my earpieces.  I actually had my glasses fall while I was standing."
2.0,"The strap fell off within two weeks of heavy use. I duct-taped it back, but I am not sure how long it will last. Too bad, it's a really nice messenger bag."
2.0,Beautiful design but very thick diameter for earlobe hole. Some stones have fallen not so long after purchase.
2.0,Fabric is pretty thin and dresses run small. I would size up or pick something else
2.0,"Bent too easily, comes easily too.  I like the size but the bending is a huge problem."
2.0,I actually liked how I looked on my ear the only problem was that my ear got really itchy and infected due to the earing which was a bummer because I wanted to keep it on I used it for about a week and then had to take it off and couldn't wear it since
2.0,"Was excited to try these because of frequent air trips to China.  The first two trips I found they worked great.  However, after the third washing, the material around the toes started loosening up and thinning.  Just not durable enough."
2.0,is not indicated
2.0,These are a stretchy slippery spandex polyester with no wool. I was really disappointed to receive what appear to be dollar store socks for $20.
2.0,i hsve to put it under the sewing machine again becsuse its not sturdy or even sewn at all really. good for a start tho
2.0,"Yuk.  Love the concept here, but the dress is kind of dumpy.  I'm 5'5&#34; and typically wear a small (medium in things where I want more room in the bodice), and this dress just looked weird.  The title calls it a drop waist, but the supposed waist was actually above my natural waist.  Despite the negatives, I would consider buying from this company again because the material felt really nice (thin without being cheap) and the stitching looked great."
2.0,"Nice simple necklace.<br /><br />UPDATE: Necklace BROKE after wearing it less than a month. The necklace would turn on my neck, exposing the clasp. So today, I go to turn it back around, and one of the links simply broke. I am saddened to have to write this review and return the necklace. I'd recommend wearing this only once in a while. This necklace is well made enough for every day wear."
2.0,Do not like that it rolls at top.
2.0,So cute but one broke the first time I tried wearing it. Super flimsy so be careful when you put them on or find something not so delicate.
2.0,"PROS:<br />It's beautiful to look at, intricate design. Size fits well.<br /><br />CONS:<br />The fabric will tear as soon as your kid moves. It's very cheap satin-like fabric that tears with the slightest tension. My niece tried it on, she was really happy, but then it tore on the inner thigh. We had it patched, and the next day it tore again on the inside of the other leg. She was really embarrassed at her birthday party, but a quick change of clothes later and she had forgotten about it.<br /><br />Wouldn't recommend for a kid's party, or dance routine, or anything that requires movement."
2.0,"Fit in shoulders, bust and length-  waist was made for a 200 lb. person!  Did not have time to alter-  will give it away.  Hate Weird sizing!"
2.0,Bought it in a larger size then I usually wear and it's a little snug
2.0,"it's not awful but it is pretty see-through and the arm holes are a bit tight for the x-large.  (I am 5'6&#34; and 135 lbs)  Definitly not as long on me as the model, hits just below waistband"
2.0,"Do not order your size. Size down due to after you hook up and pull your tabs to tighten the cincher will gather. I have had almost every waist cincher on the market and this is NOT one of my favorites. Ive worn it twice. It does not generate enough heat to make me sweat. I have to put on a cream and a saran wrap underneath. It stretched out after the 1st use, so i'd advise anyone to size down for a tighter fit. The hooks are awful. I like a quicker release but I like to give everyone I try. I do like the 3 Velcro straps for a custom pull around the waist. It does cover my whole torso which is a plus. Would I buy it again..NO!"
2.0,"Super disappointed in these gauges, I had bought the same ones about a year ago and lost one. I re-ordered a pair, thinking that they were going to be the same as they once were or as depicted in the photo, but they are not. The stones and gauges overall have gotten much smaller. 😔 Super bummed as the old ones were my favorite."
2.0,Shoe is very cheap priced and cheaply made. Wore shoe twice and the back part were your heel sits in the shoe started to fall. Shoe sole is so flat that the bottom of the shoe now has a hole in it. Not recommended for anything. Do not purchase.
2.0,This product is clearly NOT for people with skinny/small noses because they are HUGE. They do not look real at all. They say no pain but it is painful WHEN YOU HAVE TO STICK IT ALL THE WAY UP UR NOSE TO MAKE IT LOOK SOMEWHAT REALISTIC!! I would NOT recommend buying this product unless you have a wider nose.
2.0,"Fire Force Tactical Gear stated that this is a Buy 1 and get 1 free product but I only received 1 vest - so 2 stars.<br />The vest is brand new though.<br /><br />Their description is below at the time of purchase:<br />Buy 1 and get 1 FREE and FREE shipping<br />Condition: Very Used with some BLOOD stains, will wash off after 15-20 washes<br />Fully adjustable belt, easy opening waist/side panels<br />Drag Strap/Grab handle on Back<br />Made in USA"
2.0,"The bra is super cute and fits good. But the clips never stay closed. Once I put it on within an hour I'm finding that it is coming undone and if I don't keep an eye on it throughout the day it will come completely undone. It's so hard to find a good bra. I really was hoping that this one was going to be it, but it's not."
2.0,The backpack is breaking up! I do not know how this is possible. The sewing of the backpack is opening with 04 days of use.
2.0,"I ordered three pairs of these leggings and unfortunately I will be returning all 3 of them tomorrow. The material is too thin and you can literally see the outline of the labia. To be fair, they are very comfortable so if you wear them strictly around your home, you might enjoy the leggings."
2.0,The button fell off on the first day. Probably they are ok with flat road without any slope.
2.0,It works but there in no way anyone can see with this on. The eyes are cover by the light that makes it look cool. good luck with this purchase
2.0,"Beautiful design, that said, it’s cheap, plastic, the internal displays are literally stickers, the watch randomly starts and stops at will. Nice as an accessory but horrible if you actually need a working watch."
2.0,They don't stay on your face very well.  It doesn't have anything to keep it up on your nose and it just seems that it doesn't want  to stay up and the material seems a bit stretched on the opening to make it so it doesn't stay.
2.0,Ok product.  Quality of the best part not the best.  Looks like pressed cardboard. But if you use it as decorative detail only ultimately won’t need to worry about it ripping or stretching
2.0,These glasses are huge.
2.0,"They're comfy and they work, its just they're completely see through which is annoying"
2.0,"This band was stiff, hard and not easy to put on apple watch..  It was not worth the money"
2.0,lock broke only within a week use
2.0,Will not hold hair because it is flat when sitting on shoulders. Hair will fall out. Cheap garbage
2.0,Does not hold my hair back.
2.0,The dress was cute and the material was alright but when I tried it on you could see a little to much in the open area. So I returned it
2.0,Zipper broke right away. Other then that the purse was very nice good material and looks just like the pictures. Unfortunately I can not use a bag with broken zipper! As shown in pictures it only partially zips then spreads apart I have tried multiple times to fix it.
2.0,The dress was cute. But runs very small.
2.0,Too big and not the right one I ordered
2.0,Very feeble
2.0,Smaller than I expected. Wanted to carry iPad but fits it with little room for anything else. Disappointed. Wish there was a photo with model to shoe scale.
2.0,"I was disappointed in the material. It is a polyester blend- no cotton, and appears  shiny. Fits true to size."
2.0,I like the style of the shirt and the fit but it is too slick of material. I would prefer something with a little cotton for a better feel.<br />I wouldn’t buy it again.
2.0,The fit was too narrow and too small. NO memory foam as advertised. Came in a plastic bag. Not worth the price paid. Wish Amazon would get the sizing down. I have been a 9 forever. These were an uncomfortable 8
2.0,"This was a gift.  One of the hats was missing the ""ski mask"" detachable piece that covers the face.  Other than that they fit as expected."
2.0,the middle stone was broken.
2.0,Ordered 2XL and the cup size was entirely too small. Disappointed in fit. I was unable to wear the bridesmaid dress at the wedding. Color and style are true to pictures on Amazon.
2.0,Way too big for my 5 year old. But nice colors .
2.0,I don't like the cheap feel of the fabric and it is see through. It is a cute summer dress and would have been ok with the fabric as long as it was not see through..
2.0,"Very tiny clasp, hard to get on and off. Cheap- looking, disappointing."
2.0,The length and thickness is good but the color is lighter than I spect. I bough it to use with my LV graceful. It looks ok. The only thing I didn’t like is that the edgers are red and is a really bright red.
2.0,Belt is fine. Buckle does not work well. Does not flatten when closed.
2.0,I didn't get the cute bow with mine
2.0,"Very pretty bracelet, but chips fell out from the very first day.  Such a pity. I got the necklace as well and the same thing happened."
2.0,This dress came it was larger than I expected .....not at all for woman that are that heavy ....I bought it for a trip but I had to return and go for plan B
2.0,The watch was nice but the band is very small!  I do not have large wrist but when I tried on I had put on very last notch and wasn't very comfortable!
2.0,"had to return, I couldn't have worn it as a sleeve much less as a dress or tunic"
2.0,I thought it would have been way cuter. Sent it back due to quality of the skirt.
2.0,I wasn't expecting much - just a cheap pair of rubber shoes for the pool - but these were very hard and the top band fit weirdly.  The strap was loose around my toes but then tight around the section of my foot where the big toe joint is.
2.0,"I have a Tan and a Grey pair of these same pants. All are the same size. The tan and grey pair fit great. The camo ones show up, and they are too small despite being the same size. The material is also not as stretchy as the grey or tan pants despite being the same brand and style.  Overall..... not happy with them."
2.0,"The sizes are off. It fit my husband like leggings but fits me perfectly! His lost, my gain."
2.0,The one I received sizes out to about 7 1/4. The height is short. Fits like a beanie. Great for a child.
2.0,"This is going back, it was wayyy too sheer first off. Poorly made and seems like an odd shape if you don’t have a very large chest and a tiny waist."
2.0,These are soon small I needed a magnifying glass to see them. Very  disappointed.
2.0,Look very cheap and smaller than photo.
2.0,These are cute but they aren’t like most squishees.  They don’t hold the squeeze at all.  And don’t smell nice like I expected.  Wouldn’t recommend
2.0,"I really wanted to like these. They’re very cute and comfortable, but they are not very well-made. They do not stay up! And trust me, it’s not because they were too big or bought the incorrect size. They slip right down. It was as if there was no elasticity in the waste whatsoever. Sadly, I spent more time at the gym pulling them up then working out. Such a bummer. They are so cute!"
2.0,These are a complete rip off of Goodr sunglasses and they’re not even cheaper. Just buy the real thing Goodrs are fantastic. These are cheap.
2.0,Ordered small and these gloves fit my husband. Sizing is WAY off.  Size 7 ring size and what I would consider “normal” woman hands.
2.0,NO LIKE
2.0,"It's pretty thin, but worked to cover well as expected. The downside was when I wore the black over a white shell, it bled and stained the shell permanently. Be careful."
2.0,The dress is very pretty!!!! I ordered a xlarge tried it on wouldn’t go over my head looked inside the dress I was sent a large. Very upset had plans on wearing to church.
2.0,Dress fit really well I ordered a size small but the top bodice was see through and not gathered as it appears online. I’m 5’3 115 lbs I returned it.
2.0,The top was okay but the pants were waaaayy tooo big
2.0,"Snaps in front bent, no response from seller"
2.0,"I love the look, butvthe first day I wore it, today, my arm turned green."
2.0,the head  was sized too small
2.0,I had hoped the country names would show better but they tend to blend in with the background too much.  Bought it as a gift and just gave it anyway realizing it's the thought that counts. Wish the country name etching would've either had a darker background or been etched in an ink of a darker color or something that allows the names to stand out at a glance.
2.0,Much smaller than described. Inscription is already faded.
2.0,My dislike size to small gave them to my god baby. Nice colors
2.0,"Yes they are bold and yes they are oversized BUT they look like something a cartoon character would wear or something a clown would wear. They are not for me and they are not quite the look I was going for. To add to that, they are cheap-looking. I don't have a issue with purchasing cheap sunglasses. I do it all the time but the goal is for the product to NOT look cheap. These are more of a costume sunglasses and fail at being something for fashion."
2.0,"Although it is lightweight,  it's lighter in color than what is pictured and much shorter on length."
2.0,"Ordered the army green, in the picture looks very green.. it is not.. it's very much a taupe with no shade of green. Very thin material and couldn't possibly drape the body as shown in the picture. I ordered it for my petite daughter.. it doesn't flare like the picture either"
2.0,too big comparing to traditional Santa's glasses
2.0,"Earrings are beautiful, however, the description was very misleading about the size. 1st time I have ever been disappointed with an Amazon item."
2.0,If you have narrow skinny feet go with your normal size.<br />If not don't bother. And it's very difficult finding these in a wide.
2.0,"The bust area is big and baggy and the hip area is tight. I’ll have to lose weight so the hips want be so tight. The dress is beautiful, but it does feel like it was made with tough plastic."
2.0,Not what was in the picture or description. Nice wieght & size. Returns are hard for me bc of where i live so stuck with it.
2.0,I went in a creek wearing shoes and these socks and due to the way they are sewn there was a ton of sand and rocks that filled the part around the ankle and the achilles tab. So I wouldn't buy these again unless I were only walking around town in them.
2.0,"Cheap, and fine if you're just hanging out or wearing these over a speedo at swim practice. But for anything gym-related, they're unsuitable. The seams are rather weak, and the sizes are a bit small, so I'm likely to bust a seam if I bend my knees too far, much less do a squat. For reference, I'm about 6'1 and 170lbs, and I bought a medium (I normally wear waist size 32). If I were buying again, I'd get a large — and that's a big if, because I can't think of a time I'd want these over a sturdier pair of Nikes."
2.0,I like the feel and fit of them but I look down the next day and saw a little hole in the bck so not sure hw tht happen but o well. Other than tht I like the material.
2.0,It was too stretchy
2.0,Tight fit and did not come to bottom of ankle bone. Gave them to my grand daughter.
2.0,"This dress was so close to being adorable. I am 5'6"" and about 175 pounds. The dress (XL) fit perfectly everywhere except in the chest area. I do not have an overly large chest (I am a C cup), and the top of this dress was SO incredibly tight. There is absolutely no way I can wear it. Too bad because otherwise it is cute. Only order if you have a very small chest."
2.0,"I bought a size medium based on the size chart, I don’t know if I should have sizes down or not as I have to constantly pull the leggings up. I am 5’3” and about 135lbs. I’m scared if I sized down they would be somewhat see-through but the size medium is a little loose in the waist. I suggest either sizing down or just not getting these."
2.0,"I ordered a 2x , fits small . The sheer legs are also a little tight . But the low waist is the problem for me. Seems to be shaped differently than normal , disproportionate."
2.0,"I have two big problems with this product. First, it looks cheap and operates the same. It doesn't slide well at all. I find myself lifting the whole strap up due to it not sliding. Second, I can never get it on without a back strap being twisted...its awful."
2.0,"Looks adorable, but the fabric is thin and scratchy. Ripped in the crotch seam the first time she wore it, and also made my daughter’s skin break out in hives. The material is rough and basically this was a waste of money because my daughter doesn’t want to wear it."
2.0,Overpriced and pretty low quality material. It was stringy and thin
2.0,It was satin in my security field I need it to be a different kind of material like polyester.
2.0,Very cheaply made. Batteries dont last that long.  Wouldnt trust putting this in the washing machine
2.0,Ordered usual size 2xl and it was short and snug. Style of shirt is desirable but sizing was off.
2.0,Looks great but worked for 3 months and then the right side broke. Now trying to contact the manufacture but no luck.
2.0,"small, think and flimsy"
2.0,I had to tighten it to keep it from leaking. any type of squinting will make it leak. I bought something higher rated.
2.0,I purchased these Fondgem Black Genuine Leather Cord Chain Necklace - 2.0 mm Natural Leather Cord Chains for my Granddaughter to use as a Choker necklaces. The necklaces have a weird smell. I am not sure if the smell will go away. I am keeping them due to the price but not sure if they are safe.
2.0,There is no indication or nor a test that is convincing that this product is magnetic. It does not have any magnets that appear as others of this type do . It neither has any magnetic qualities.
2.0,"I have had this watch for 10 days and it has stopped working.  It could be just a battery, but this is terrible service for the cost of it."
2.0,"Seam in back started falling apart the first time I wore it, I went ahead and stitched it up because it was perfect - until it shrunk 8&quot; in cold wash with line dry :/"
2.0,"Looks nice with my work outfits, but tangled so easily. I bought it 2 months ago, and now I can’t use anymore. Can’t get it untangled :("
2.0,Not sure if it is my kid not taking good care or just the extremities not sturdy enough and breaking apart.
2.0,The leather of watch is not soft. That is look like the face leather.
2.0,it hurts my nose so bad like extremely bad so im gonna get a real nose piercing
2.0,I returned.  Didn't like style.
2.0,The  shirt is  big the arms are tiny and tight it's not  worth what I paid for it
2.0,"I'm a gymnast so I was looking for something to keep my hair back while tumbling. So many of the reviews said &#34;no-slip&#34; and &#34;stays put&#34; so I thought I'd give it a shot. It slips off constantly when I'm flipping or tumbling or any time I'm upside-down. If you tip your head back at all and it slides right off. Maybe it's fine for something like running or weight-lifting, but even in something as low-impact as my yoga class, the head band slipped off uselessly. I generally like the colors, and maybe it would be fine as a fashion accessory, but if your sporty and you need something to keep the hair or sweet out of your eyes, these are not for you."
2.0,Good for help blocking out dust but are too thin to use as a face mask.
2.0,I typed 3&#34; heel in the search bar of Amazon and these shoes came up. They are WAY taller than that at least 4 1/2 inch heel. There was no heel height in the description which would have been nice. The issue I have with these shoes is that they smelled. Like REALLY smelly as soon as I opened the package they stunk and they are a velvety material which was a little shocking. I had to send them back because my even was the next day and they didn't air out and still smelled so I returned them.
2.0,"Not like photo, super thin and stones are cheap cheap looking."
2.0,The skirt is too short
2.0,"not red, more orang colored.  tried to return them but it cost more than it was worth = ("
2.0,"Incorrect labeling, packaging, and incorrect product description. These are more like for 32"" waist. This review is for KNOCKER Men Boxer Briefs. Size Medium 34-36 was purchased and the waist is too small."
2.0,"When the product arrived, the lettering on the shirt was worn and cracked. I was a little disappointed being that I needed the shirt for Pi Day and didn't have time to order a new one. The shirt material was soft."
2.0,"Seller was fine, fast shipping, no hassle on the return.  Boots are junk.  Flimsy material and not at all appropriate to wear in the snow... or a light drizzle.  Tongue has virtually no overlap to keep out water.  Color is way off as well.  Terrible boots.  Returned."
2.0,The bottom was small and the strap on the top was big. I am a 32DDD and the top was big.
2.0,Really not comfortable especially after surgery. Zipper not easy to close.
2.0,Doesn't feel like real leather and the clasp on the long shoulder strap broke first time I snapped it in the purse.
2.0,Fabric stretches out really quickly. It's not even that comfortable even for a sleeping bra. Don't recommend.
2.0,"Poor quality, not worth $30. Picture shows “Minecraft” printed on front,back and hood. It’s only printed on the front and back. Material very thin, and not much stretch to it. Will be returning."
2.0,buckle to narrow for belt. pinched belt
2.0,This dress is ill fitting.  There is no room for breasts!  I wear a size 10 and I ordered the size they recommended but the breast part is much too small.  The dress does not look like the picture.  If you have breasts....don't buy this dress!
2.0,Purchased 4 months ago and already falling apart. There is only 9 cards in sleeve and so far I lost two hex screws and three additional screws are now loose. I save them by tightening them. Lock tight should have been employed to hold screws in place
2.0,Thin material and not very practical.
2.0,TOO AWARE OF PLUGS IN MY EARS.  NO MORE EFFECTIVE THAN THE LITTLE FOAM ONE'S.
2.0,"The straps are very uncomfortable. They are set too wide in the back and cross in a weird way over your shoulder blades. It also offers little support. Might be ok for yoga or something very low impact but no good for circuit training. The pads in it are odd looking and you can see the edges of them. That said, it was not expensive and came quickly."
2.0,"pros: Looks good, motor is quiet.<br /><br />Cons: power adapter doesn't work. batteries are Dead in 2-3 days. Watches fill loosely, and wobble around inside, scratching the clear plastic as they rotate."
2.0,Not impressed  at all. AWFUL MATERIAL
2.0,Very cute and fits well but the gems came off very easily. Lost 4 the first time she wore them.
2.0,I was very excited about these but the pictures is what I received. I’m still going to wear them but I’ll have to figure out how to brush them without losing so much fluff.
2.0,I wore there for not even a week<br />And the are stretched so out of shape they no longer fit
2.0,I had bought the olive one for 4th of July.  It was pretty good quality and looked like the picture. So I decided to get the American Flag one instead.  The fabric is very thin and see through and doesn’t fit the same.  The flag is printed on front and back but is lighter in color than shown and not the same pattern.<br />I’m returning it and wearing the olive instead.<br />They all fit small. I’m a size 12 and needed the XXL.
2.0,"I guess these hats are not what they used to be. I bought 3 different Polo hats from 3 different vendors and they were all the same. They arrived quickly but some of the sowing was off and the material seems cheap. Admittedly, I am not a connoisseur of fine Polo hats. Maybe that's how they have always been but I will not be buying them again."
2.0,"The blade looks great but the handle is very cheap plastic and the screws came loose in a few days, tightened them a few times then they wouldn't tighten at all."
2.0,"It was a bright highlighter pink and not coral like it shows in the picture. The seams were loose near the bust area. It's cute, but it seemed not well put together."
2.0,Horrible quality. Will return.
2.0,Too small and not well-made or attractive
2.0,"This dress is really cute on, but poorly made.  Don't buy it unless you are handy with a needle and thread.  Both straps snapped and came unsewn within an hour of putting it on and I had to scramble to find safety pins.  They were simple to sew back on afterward, but it could have been really embarrassing if I hadn't been wearing a bathing suit underneath."
2.0,"It feels extremely cheap. and is much bigger than I expected. It looks large even on my boyfriend - and he isn't a small person by any means. It made a nice sentimental gift, but he won't ever wear it."
2.0,"I really wanted padding for the crotch(sorry) and seat area, but these did not have nearly enough and I will be returning them. Might work for 2 miles around town, but not for a 10-20 mile ride."
2.0,"These shirts are listed as linen in heading, but in fact are 85%cotton, 15% linen.  If you like linen shirts you wont like these."
2.0,"It Is Very Cute But Soon As I Went To Zip It Up , It Broke 😒 . Luckily My Mommy Got Me A Michael Kors Clutch ❤️ ."
2.0,Not what I expected not good quailty
2.0,Not true to size. Ordered 2 sizes bigger and it still didn't fit
2.0,"I don't think the belt is leather. If it is, I still don't like it."
2.0,"This jumper is super classy, and very cute. However, the material which feels like a Halloween costume polyester is not giving at all and fits super small. Size up at least one."
2.0,"This is so much smaller than the size it’s supposed to be in the sizing chart. I only use it as an undershirt for work, other wise I’d never be able to wear it alone. Is way to tight."
2.0,"The size chart says S = Size 4.  The cup on the top barely covers me and my bust is falling out.  I am a D cup.  This bikini will only fit someone who is an A. In a world where ""all sizes"" are supposed to be accepted this is frustrating to happen twice with the same company.  It is a bikini made for a very petite woman, with very petite features.  Although a D cup, I am still a size 2.  Both times the bottoms fit fine, but the top is ONLY MADE FOR SMALL BREASTED WOMEN."
2.0,"These shoes are too narrow for wide feet. I thought they would stretch some, but they are still bothering me."
2.0,"Wasn’t what I expected. I was expecting the same feel as my other hobo wallet that I had. For 140 dollars, it wasn’t worth it. Had to return the item."
2.0,Strap broke during first use. Ordered a size up and was still snug. Cute and comfy fabric.
2.0,"It is not as its picture, the top is not shifted at one of the shoulder as expected and as they are showing it on the picture, iam disappointed and I want to return it"
2.0,"Big black mark right in the center of the yellow, product flaw. Fit is ok, a little small."
2.0,It was very pretty till the chance n broke  was very disappointed.
2.0,I love Yosi Samra and this show was sooooooo disappointing! I ordered a 4Y for me and my feet were so hot and sweaty. No where near as comfortable as my &#34;women's size 6&#34;
2.0,NOT what pictured at all. It was cheap and weird.
2.0,"The hoodie was in good shape but the description gives the impression this item would fit anyone, male, female, adult, teen and also indicated XXL.  This item is not for an XXL Adult Male.  It was a gift so I was disappointed that I had to return.  Accurate sizing is important!"
2.0,Fell apart after just three wears. Had to take them in to shoe repair to have bottom rubber sole replaced as the metal tab holing the toe grab in came through the bottom.
2.0,"I bought these for my daughter for a Christmas gift. They run small, but I read the reviews before purchasing them and bought a whole size up from what she normally wears. The size up fit her perfectly. She loved them. The heel fell off of one of them after only wearing them for a couple of months."
2.0,The costume looked great BUT I ordered an adult xl and I think I got a kid xl.
2.0,really a rip off.
2.0,No pockets like described not to heavy duty and the ties broke pretty easy  :(
2.0,"Awful.  The cut and fit are ok, but the fabric is cheap and shiny, like material you would use for a Halloween Costume."
2.0,kinda cheapish looking fabric. It had a whole in the pocket when arrived.
2.0,"Dress is so short, I can only use as a shirt appropriately"
2.0,This runs WAY small!
2.0,"I tried on 28 different pairs of swim leggings from Amazon, and this was one of them.<br /><br />These are more relaxed fitting than the many other pair of swim leggings I tried on. They do not cling to the skin when dry. The length of the skirt was just below my knees (I'm 4'10&#34;), whereas all the other skirted swim bottoms I tried came to just above my knee or higher. I do not think these looked good on me, because they were matronly.<br />Quality is just average, especially considering you can buy Coolibar brand swim bottoms for nearly the same price, and the quality of Coolibar is much better. Unless you are specifically looking for modesty (not flattery), these are not worth the price.<br /><br />Ranking of Swim Legging Brands, from Best to Worst<br />1. Private Island<br />2.

2.0,"i suggest going a size up.<br />i am 5'2&#34; and 145 lbs. size b cup, i ordered a medium and it fits like 1 inch below my bottom. it is very short and do not put it in the dryer, i have a long tank top now."
2.0,"Here's why it's going back...<br />I like the idea of this device.<br />I may have received a bad one, but it was factory-sealed.<br />This tool is basically a dial gauge lodged in a weighted base, then twist-locked into an (ABS?) base.  The base is there to give you consistent spacing from the lugs when moving it around.<br />It's not a tuner.  Don't mistake it for one.<br />It is used to measure the tension of the head at various places (at the lugs) on the head.<br />Why am I returning it?<br /><br />Mine is &#34;sticky&#34; as hell.  It jumps all over, very erratically, when I pick it up and set it down.  I can get a reading of 68, do nothing, lift and replace and get 80, do nothing, lift and replace and get 74.  Crazy.  And when actuating by finger, I see it jump as well.<br />I've used a ton of cheap-o MIC dial indicators, and it's been AGES since I've seen a bad one.  Ugh.<br />So, this is just not reliable without me having to lift and set it down like 5 times to get &#34;best 3 out of 5&#34;.<br /><br />One other HUGE thing...<br /><br />They changed this TW200 (from the TW100) to lie flat.  I far prefer it like the TW100m but here's the bad part, and it's REALLY bad.<br /><br />The face has extremely tiny writing on a BLACK face with some sort of CHECKERED backgound.  The background is not solid black with white writing as shown on the box itself - see attached pics.  This makes it impossible to read even in a well-lit room.  Don't even think about it for a gig.<br /><br />I added a couple pics.  Believe me, the picture is way easier to see than what it looks like in use.  But you can see this weird race-car-style checkered flag pattern.  Why in the world would they do that??<br /><br />So it's going back."
2.0,Ordered child size.  Big enough for adult.  To big for child.
2.0,Very flimsy. Runs big. I will be returning it. Cheap material. I'm very disappointed in this piece. Not cute at all like the picture.
2.0,It's very cheap made
2.0,Sizing is WAY off.
2.0,The paint job was not completely dry before handling. Sending pendant back.
2.0,Two stars not for quality but because of my lack of knowledge on size.  I was looking for something bigger.
2.0,"I swear, this was made for a twelve year old...It didn't fit at all. :( Beautiful quality, but I didn't like it because I couldn't put the damn thing on."
2.0,"This dress fit in the arms and waist, but not in the bust at all. It really accentuated all of the bigger parts of me. The length was about 2 inches above my knees."
2.0,"So disappointing in size. If you are larger chested, get a larger size than you normally would. Such a cute jacket though."
2.0,Feel old church grandma 😩
2.0,Hat brim came disfigured
2.0,"This dress is so cute and nicely made, but it is sized SO SMALL. Like, comically small. I had to return it."
2.0,This dress was ok but short and tight around the breast area.
2.0,Fit is perfect. Band however gets dirty quickly and is impossible to clean. It looked nice for less than a week. I went back to the supplied black band.
2.0,Bag arrived with mark on it and contents were crushed.  Very disappointed that I have to waste time to return it and I needed the bag.
2.0,"Unless you're looking for really thin slinky pj type pants, don't get these. Really thin stretchy material, loose, and comfortable. But, they really have that Zsa Zsa Gabor fancy PJ look and feel to them."
2.0,came dirty.
2.0,"The square pieces can break very easily if you bite down on them accidentally, and it feels uncomfortable in your mouth :/"
2.0,Pants are more like a 1X
2.0,"If you bought the boots to fold it over so the flannel shows (like the original picture of the boots), then be ready to be let down. The size of the boot is printed on the part you will fold down! So everyone can see what size boot you wear. If you try to rib it off, it will rip off the fake leather and leave holes. Dumbest designer ever."
2.0,I bought this for my husband for Christmas and the watch stopping keeping time in March (so only 3 months).  OG customer service not very helpful and making it difficult to issue a warranty replacement.
2.0,Seems very thin ...
2.0,"Looks cute, til it has been washed few times.."
2.0,The fabric is too heavy and is not double sided.  The mask does not stay up.
2.0,I am a small. This product is thick and does not give. I I ordered 2 other pair made of the same 90% polyester . They are thinner and feel great. I guess I deserve a refund since I cannot wear these pants to teach a group exercise class. False advertising.
2.0,I give these 2 stars and the reason I give these 2 stars is because the light stopped working on one shoe after 2 wears. The appearance is nice but what's the use if the light stopped working?  My granddaughter was very disappointed.
2.0,"Fell apart so easy with little wear. Definitely did not hold up like previous pairs we've had, and definitely not worth the price we paid"
2.0,This will be Christmas gift but seems to be too small and it has a hole.
2.0,"It feels like a clown dress. Nice color and fabric, but awkwardly styled/sized. Not sure what I'll do with it yet."
2.0,"Love them, I just wish the sides would fit over my ears. They are way too long.  They go past my ears so the metal rubs against the top crease on my ear."
2.0,"The fabric was more of a woolen fabric and fits on the small side. The picture makes it look long, loose and baggy. In reality, it is form fitting and tight. I am 5ft7in and it's length on me comes to the top of my thigh, just below the bend of my leg and over my butt. I do wear this sweater with skinny jeans and boots and have gotten many compliments, but as it wasn't really what I was expecting, I am only giving it 2.5 stars."
2.0,"Cheap quality. But I guess that's all I can expect, with the cheap price I paid for them. They worked well as St. Paddy's Day accessories which is what I intended them for, but they're not much use beyond that."
2.0,"Received helmet in a short time, however, several issues were immediately visible. The inner helm does not line up well with the face portion, so part of the right visor was blocked. Also, the screws in the sides do not hold the face in place, and often it lifts. Best of all, the steel that was welded together may be shiny on the inside, but spray painted silver on the inside. Why? Not simply for ascetics, but to hide the rust corroding the integrity of the helmet. Also, even if you care for it, the rust will makes it's way onto that shiny finish the helmet has.<br /><br />If you're looking for a helmet, this one probably isn't the one you want. If more care was placed into materials used and proper construction, it would actually be a good, inexpensive helmet... unfortunately, that's not the case here."
2.0,"It is too small on the ear, was waiting for something bigger .<br /><br />but same on picture ..<br /><br />wish this is helpful"
2.0,-30° my ass.... It's currently 26° and I can feel the cold through the gloves.
2.0,"I normally wear an 8.5 or a eu 39 and I ordered and received this size. these shoes ran very small, did not fit at all. super uncomfortable(likely due to not fitting) and also the quality of the shoes wasn't very good. The platform is a light foam that seems like it will come apart from the shoe quickly with any use. The design is very cute and they look decent, I would probably use these shoes for a costume if they had fit me, but definitely not everyday sort of wear!"
2.0,"I love everything about this watch but its size. Even with paying close attention to the measurements given, I still found it way too bulky when placed upon my woman average size wrist. It's really a shame."
2.0,very expensive for what it is plus cheap material
2.0,"I was so looking forward to receiving this unique-looking sandal and indeed it was a really nice sandal.  The fit is true to size and width.  But alas, both shoes were damaged and marked enough that the blemishes instantly take away from the look of the shoe.  I was so disappointed because my size 4 isn't easy to find.  Oh well, back to my search."
2.0,"White it fit will in the middle, the top and bottom flared out so much they were visible under my shirt. The back top stuck out almost 3 inches, and the bottom was like a little 'skirt' around my hips. Maybe it's just my body type, but this did not work for me."
2.0,"The clasp broke within an hour of wearing it, it doesn't lay on the wrist like it does in the picture."
2.0,"material is not that good, the size is too big"
2.0,Due to the tightness of the dress it was inappropriate for the event I had purchased it for.<br />Would like to return and contacted the seller.
2.0,"You get what you paid for. I decided to try these based on so many good reviews, but was leery about how great they could be for such a low price for a 2 pack. I should have put the $11 toward a higher end pair. I bought 1.25 and everything at my computer felt just a little out of focus. I have Foster Grant's of the same strength, not computer tinted, but the comparison in clarity is dramatic. I ended up ordering a higher end pair of Prospek glasses, which are arriving today. Hoping those will work out better."
2.0,Se le cayo la piedra la segunda vez que me la puse De la nada sin ningun golpe ni nada
2.0,The earrings were just a tad too large for my lobes.  Not what I was expecting.
2.0,Not accurate description
2.0,Runs really small and the material is really slick and doesn’t give at all.
2.0,Very sheer fabric. Way too big. Had to return.
2.0,Way small and short in length and definitely not a sweater looks much longer in the picture and is a weird nylon like fabric not sweater material at all it’s the third thing I have ordered on line with fabric like that and I don’t like it bummer
2.0,This dress is definitely cut smaller then normal. The material is very thin too. Comes very wrinkled. Needs to be steamed or ironed.
2.0,"I would suggest not ordering the blue, it's so drab, it's almost like a light grayish blue.  It's a very ugly color, I took the tags off otherwise I would return it."
2.0,"Very dainty and pretty costume jewelry. It tarnished very quickly, less than a year."
2.0,"nunca recibí el artículo, tuve que cancelar el pedido."
2.0,"Very small fit ,larger the size, the material for the main part Terrible."
2.0,"I ordered a 3-4 of this dress & it was huge! Then, I ordered a 2-3 & it was about the same size. My child wears this size and it was WAY too big. :/"
2.0,Insoles were way too wide and too short for my shoes so I had to return.
2.0,I liked the color but not the material/fabric used to make the pants.  There is NO elasticity in these pants and I need my pants stretchy just a little bit. I will be returning them.
2.0,My legs are too short to wear the stockings and straps on thigh. Overall. I shouldnt have purchased this one as I knew there would be something wrong with it. It needs underwire for large breasts over C cup. Since I purchased this I have not worn it but one time to try it on. I am not happy about this purchase and could not return in time to get money back
2.0,"While this is pretty and a nice size, it is next to impossible to get a picture in it. There isn't a piece that comes out, like a frame, to insert the picture. Sadly we had no option but to give it to the recipient and hope for the best. So disappointed."
2.0,The magnification is only clear in the center of the lens...blurry around the edges.  Also I received 2 of the same color...not 3 as shown in the picture.
2.0,"It looks just like the picture, but the size chart seems to run large. So it just hung on me and made me feel like I was trying on a bag. It was nice otherwise. Ended up being more yellow ( it's Highlighter yellow) then the bride wanted so I simply returned it. Very easy to return."
2.0,"Liked the full length compression pants so i thought i'd give these a try. These are way too long, they stuck out under normal length shorts. Had to return."
2.0,The seam is coming out
2.0,I did not like that the zipper got stuck. my husband had to unzip them for me. I haven't worn them since that time.
2.0,It was bigger than the sizing chart made it seem and the material was very cheap
2.0,"There is one size print, so on the 2x I bought for my husband the print is wayyy too small on the back."
2.0,"Not the right color, way to dark, missing the strap can't contact customer service, I ordered a small and this bag is way to huge! but its cute"
2.0,very hard to get on waay to small than described go up 2 sizes
2.0,I ordered a medium and it was extremely tight on the chest area. Re-ordered in a size large and still had the same issue.
2.0,"Color is really pretty, but the dress has no shape and looks like a moo moo. The ruffles we're seen on backwards. Not as flattering as I anticipated"
2.0,Cute and comfortable but the thigh part is way too big falls down so annoying I had to sew it and it still doesn't stay.
2.0,"The small number is oversized. The small fits ""women size 8"". Mareial is a okay... its not as nice as the picture."
2.0,"I have this in the apricot in an XL.  The apricot is a light khaki color without any peach or pink to it.  I'm a size 12 and 5'3"".  This set is super unflattering on me, especially the pants.  They are too fitted through the waist, hips, and thighs and show ever bump and lump.  The top is too large and droopy at the neck and arm length. The pants are too slim but also short. The top is just too big.  I think this would fit someone who is slim and straight best.  The fabric is a fine sweater knit and comfortable.  The pants are held up by a thin tie and they are pretty heavy.  I think the band would get uncomfortable after a lot of wear."
2.0,[[VIDEOID:2771fa57dc413b52dea47d2c16be4df4]] This is a really cute dress and it fits very nicely.. but the strap by the neck does not stay as intended over the shoulder. The strap is constantly sliding up around the neck area or causes a droop in the top when you pull it down. This is a great concept and I love the look of the dress if you don't move after you've positioned it correctly. But it just doesn't work as you're moving around. The fabric is great the feel is great I like the thickness of the fabric and that it hides your natural skin bumps. But design This top strap better so that it works.
2.0,"I ordered the items due to the picture shown for advertisement. Show what you really have, stop catfishing products.  GARBAGE!"
2.0,While the quality of the belt was okay the sizeing was not. I ordered a 44 and itmore like. 42/43
2.0,"**Edit** I dont wear this shirt all the time, just every so often, and my knot at the bottom came undone like the stitching came apart or something. Im going to try to sew it... Dissapointed.<br /><br />I wear XL and bought XL. It is amazing. It doesnt feel cheap as you can imagine some no-branded clothes might feel. Its got a classy feel to it, and hangs really well. Makes me feel very pretty. Its nice that you can dress it up or down and it will always look good.<br />The colors are fabulous!"
2.0,"HUGE - Swimmingly, Tentedly HUGE"
2.0,"The bottom was too small, but the top was too big. Oh and the underwire started poking out during the first try."
2.0,Looks better online. Too big. Order 2 sizes smaller if interested in purchasing this dress.
2.0,Haven't worn it yet. The thing is a tent and I followed the size chart. So much for that.
2.0,"The bras fit OK and the colors are great. I didn't need the pads so I wear the bra without them. My problem is the seams on top show through my shirts - especially T-shirts.<br /><br />Also, the bras offer very minimal support.  I personally don't like the ""jiggly"" feeling."
2.0,Tangle mess
2.0,Like why are these almost touching my eyes. They’re so long.
2.0,"Way too small. My 11 yr old normally wears a 12/14 in PJ bottoms. These fleece pants are so short that the size 16/18 is even too short on him...did I mention hes only 11, and hes average size."
2.0,"Wasn’t as what I expected, had little freys in it like they were used."
2.0,"the dress is cute, basic. the neckline is higher than pictured.<br /><br />the thing that bothers me about this dress is it's ribbed. no where in the drescription does it mention the dress is ribbed. i wanted a plain, SMOOTH dress. but it's not. it's ribbed.<br /><br />i'm gonna keep it, because even though it wasn't advertised accurately, it was inexpensive and at least it is black."
2.0,"It was a comfortable hat, but the lettering is poor quality, and I expect won't last a year.  I certainly won't try to wash it. It seems that will guarantee that the custom lettering will fall off.  The design is on an angle, and the hat is not symetrical."
2.0,"This is definitely not what I meant to order. I cannot complain too much, since the product itself is not bad.<br />What is with all of the extra/additional embossed words? It would look much nicer if it was just simple and without all of this excess.<br />I wanted something that was small and compact, but this is a full-size luggage tag."
2.0,"it looks great, BUT it is way too large and so, it won't stay on"
2.0,"The size fits the way I felt it would, but one of the strings broke as I tried to put it on. It's fixable, but the sewing was a flimsy."
2.0,"The ""cubic zirconia"" are cast plastic. And I doubt anyone would use 18K gold with plastic. The only thing accurately described is the glass ball, which is made of clear glass making it heavy and uncomfortable to wear."
2.0,Rrturned
2.0,"Cheaply made, immediately creased and fur inside has a foam backing that hangs out of the top."
2.0,I’m a size 8.5 and these were too small. After wearing them around my house for a day I noticed some of the rubber on the bottom was already coming off.
2.0,Too big. Not as delicate I thought it would be... :(
2.0,Just didnt fit right
2.0,I purchased the blue maxi dress and the color and style is beautiful but I gave it 2 stars because it is see-through!!  I would not consider this a dress but more of a beach/swim cover up due to the sheerness so I've returned it.
2.0,Meh... It's not the waffle-knit henley I expected. My first thought was it's a fabric pattern my mother would wear & she's 75. It's really thin. A second layer would be a necessity. Returning it without trying it on so can't comment on the fit.
2.0,"I added this charm to my Pandora bracelet and it was a LOT larger than the other charms.  Also, it's not shiny.  Overall it was just too off-looking to keep on my bracelet.  I had to take it off but I didn't return it in hopes that eventually I'll find something to add it to."
2.0,It was cute...but it broke the same day i wore it. It looked like it was capable of breaking that easily too.  I would not purchase again.
2.0,"Product fits way too small. I got an XL which usually fits me perfect, if not, too big sometimes. The “high waisted” bottoms were like regular bottoms, they landed far below my belly button. The top even looked small. It was more like a S or M."
2.0,They run REALLY small for one and for two they are SUPER short. I don't even like wearing them around the house bc I feel like my booty is sticking out! I would go elsewhere to get sleep shorts!
2.0,"I wanted to love this dress. It was so cute on me, but the quality is terrible. I actually ordered it twice. The first time, the bottom was snagged and the back seam ripped open. The second time, the bodice was all snagged and the coloring off (white marks through the blue lines). Not worth the obviously poor quality."
2.0,"Ordered these in December for a trip in February. Just opened them and there are 4 beautiful and sturdy leather tags, but only 2 of the steel attachment rings. I’m past my return date so I guess I paid for 4 but only get to use 2. I’ll try to attach the other 2 some other way but they won’t be nearly as secure. Disappointed."
2.0,These glasses are very thin the pic makes them look thick but not good quality
2.0,"Terrible fit. I ordered a size XL and for reference I'm 5'5&#34; and 140 pounds. I can't lift up my arms at all or it will ride up my crotch. Perhaps if you have a smaller torso it will fit. The material was fine, it wasn't too thin. Would have been perfect for a summer outfit, but I have to return it."
2.0,"I'm 5'10 190 pounds, order L as I used to. sleeves are  too long but tight . Chest fits ok a little bit tigth. the material is not what I expected. Did not like it."
2.0,"I bought a small and a medium, I'm usually a size 2 - The elastic waistbands on the skirt and the top were so tight, they left marks and I couldn't breathe. Even the medium was so tight and the skirt and top were too baggy. Would be super cute except for the elastic"
2.0,Top portion of dress was too tight!  Used the recommended dress size. Was sorely disappointed.
2.0,They fit well but the elastic cut into my hips.
2.0,"Its cute but DEFINITELY NOT A DRESS.  I'm a size 2 so if I can't wear it as a dress,  I don't know who can. I'm not returning it because I can wear it w/leggings.  It is boxy so it needs belting.<br />So if u want an OVER SIZED SWEATER this is it. NOT a dress"
2.0,Found the material to be rough and scratchy. Returned this shirt.
2.0,"Love the color. I'm 61"" 235lbs. Usually order 4 or 5x because this stuff runs super small. This was actually too big every where. The legs were huge and baggy at the bottom.  You could lose a small child in the pocket! LOL fabric was very heavy. Like my winter weight leggings"
2.0,HUGE- so big I had to return
2.0,"This dress is a great color but definitely way too small.  Based upon other reviews, I ordered the large for my 5'2&#34; and 160 lb self.  The waist was so small I couldn't even get the dress on."
2.0,"Was so excited to get this, it fit as expected, but after the third day of wearing it, the chain just snapped right in the middle. The broken ends looked brittle, not like silver should look. I didn't wear it with socks or anything that could have snagged or pulled at it, so not sure why it just broke unless there was a weak or substandard construction. Waste of money."
2.0,"It isn't well made.  I put my hands inside the pockets and one got stuck on fabric threads.  I have to wear it with a long sleeved shirt and a sweater when it's below 30 degrees or very windy.  I wore it to the hospital to see my husband, and I fell in the crosswalk and had to wash it.  Otherwise, I would have sent it back."
2.0,"Tiny, hollow back. Be fine for a 9 year old. Going shopping for an adult charm bracelet."
2.0,"I use a full length, plush body pillow every night for sleep. I sleep on my side and like to use the body pillow between my legs to support my knees and also spoon the top of the pillow with my chest pressing into it and arms draped over. A normal body pillow provides my body with spine alignment and upper body pressure relief and support.<br /><br />This is what I was looking for in an inflatable travel pillow so I can get that same support traveling and camping.<br /><br /> I was excited about this pillow, however, it did not deliver due to it's shape. Being a flat rectangle, it could give me support between my knees with a few inches of ushion between my legs.  However, this came at the cost of only having 3 inches near my chest to rest my arm on. This did not give me the upper body and arm support I wanted.  Conversely, if I turned the pillow so it was narrow and tall, I could get some chest/arm support, but it it was too tall to comfortably fit between my knees.<br /><br />I would reccomend the makers of this product to design a conical body pillow that allows for a smaller diameter near the legs and larger one near the top for upper body spooning.<br /><br />The inflation valve was easy to use and I could blow it up in 15 deep breaths. Not bad! I did have some issues with accidentally knocking the valve and having it rapidly deflate. SAD.<br /><br />The texture was comfortable and it didn't smell like a lot of other plastic inflatables.<br /><br />Overall the product didn't fit my needs of a body pillow even though some other aspects about the pillow were nice."
2.0,Más chico de lo esperado y mala calidad
2.0,"I own several authentic Inter Miami Jerseys, this one is not genuine. FAKE jersey."
2.0,I was hoping it would have been a little better.
2.0,It’s not as long as it’s advertised to be
2.0,"It’s actually falls off my face , I guess you will have to order by size."
2.0,"Seller description listed as 95% cotton 5% elastane- fact is, shirt is 100% synthetic. Feels like a dollar store night gown. Shirt is super cute & fits just right- it is just cheap fabric. I was expecting the purple to be more like 'Barney' & less berry, but it is the chinsy material that is responsible for this fail."
2.0,"These pants are super low quality. Not only are they completely see-through (that white underneath is my white biker-short type underwear), but just the way they fall on my body in the legs is pretty cheap and tacky looking. I used the sizing given, and as you can see, they are way too tight around my hips and can we say camel toe ?!?! I do not recommend."
2.0,"Some lights were dim or did now work, but a good extra for the pinata.  Would not buy again though."
2.0,Funny fit. Had to return. It was too short and too wide for my girl and she is average in weight and height.
2.0,"Cute set , but very poor workmanship. One sleeve was long than the other . Stitches were off which caused a pulling. However the bottoms were a great fit"
2.0,While the watch itself looks even better than it does in the picture I had two separate issues when I received it. The first issue was that when I received the watch a pin had already fallen out leaving the wristband broken. I was able to easily re-insert the pin however the wrist band felt like it was sized for a child. I am a larger man but have smaller wrists and was surprised when the clasp wouldn't close. Unfortunately I had to return it.
2.0,"Very pretty color and style but, waaay to short. Too small over all. Would've probably needed to get 2 sizes bigger for it to fit properly."
2.0,"These pants were too big and very unflattering, not what I expected as they looked really nice."
2.0,Plan on replacing the hanging hardware on these. The stones are gorgeous but the silver loop is a complete joke. The stone is way too heavy for the flimsy hardware they put on.
2.0,Within minutes of my daughter wearing these they cut into her ankle bone. The design is cute but I don’t ever foresee those areas will stop cutting/rubbing.
2.0,"I bought this for my daughter.  I got it for her to use while exercising.  She says it doesn't stay put for someone with short, thick hair.  She ended up getting rid of it."
2.0,Its not real gold for sure. The latches are weird too. They are difficult to close and i dont like the flat side of the post. The shape of the post and weight of the earring makes it kind of uncomfortable. They are cute though
2.0,"With my feet, I shouldn't be wearing flip flops. Let's just get that out of the way. I have a stressed flexor that acts up if I wear soft-soled shoes. But sometimes cheap flip flops like these are stiff enough to get me through a day. Sadly, these are made sloppily, and the strap angles your foot off to one side.<br />Gave two stars because the surface actually feels pretty comfortable, and would be nice if my for stayed on that surface.<br />You'll never catch a podiatrist dead in flip flops, but I wouldn't be surprised if they had these manufactured just to drum up business."
2.0,"This product was a terrible buy. I bought it with the size that was recommended in the sizing chart. When I received the product, it came in a large, zip-loc type bag and the bra itself was only covered by some oddly shaped plastic covering that you peel off. I tried on the bra and not even up to two minutes of having it &#34;on&#34; (it never truly fit me properly) the sides began peeling off the I have to re-stick them. This kept on happening and then it just got to the point that the sides refused to stick at all, rendering the whole bra useless.<br /><br />The moral of this review is that you should just save your money and go buy a more expensive/better bra, instead of wasting your money on this. Or, you can just free the girls instead and wear your outfit in peace."
2.0,the material is not cotton
2.0,Unfortunately it was not for me but the idea is great just need be the real size. It’s a little small and doesn’t fit. I hope the company fix and bring the solution.
2.0,It looks ok but design is not crisp. The bracelet is very hollow feeling and flimsy not sure about durability yet.
2.0,"I AM SO DISAPPOINTED.... THE ACTUAL ITEM IS NOTHING LIKE THE PICTURE. IT IS VERYYYY THIN, AND SHORT... ALMOST LIKE A REGULAR CARDIGAN."
2.0,"Beautiful earrings, this is my second time purchasing them. The clasps dont last long and they arent secured to your ears. Loose them easily or the secure locks break and they end up useless"
2.0,"It's super cute, but is really small an the necklace is very tiny."
2.0,watch band too shinny which in my opinion makes it look cheap and it's not.
2.0,Thought I would recive something simalr to what was pictured but I got something different. It's a bikini with 2 small baby triangles for the top and a long (but covers nothing) bottoms! I'm a size d and I am a bit more thicker than the model but I though based on what was shown I could work with it because I could tie to my needs.....clearly not. I feel like a really really petite girl or a small child could only wear this.
2.0,"I purchased these socks because my daughter was complaining about cold feet. I thought that these would keep her feet a bit warmer than her seasonless cotton socks, but she has reported that they are not. The construction of these socks is more tubular than shaped, and they molt a bit when being washed. My full impression: Meh."
2.0,"I wanted an inexpensive pair of oversized sunglasses and I loved the look of these. However, within a week, the lens popped out. Just at the top edge which made it extremely difficult to fix without damaging the frame or snapping it in half. Otherwise, I would have kept these for a while."
2.0,"I got this in size 6-12 months. My daughter is 11 months, and just about average size. This outfit is adorable. But, it is far too big. There is no way it would fit an average baby in this size range. Unfortunately, I’ll have to return it as it won’t fit her anytime soon."
2.0,"Well, my husband laughed out loud not once, but twice when I tried this jumper on. First, he said I came out of the bedroom looking like a little boy as I picked at the crotch cleavage! Second, he thought it looked like something out of the 70s. I admit, it was kind of funny, haha! Anyway, the fabric is comfortable and lightweight. However, I found the top to be too big and obviously the inseam too short. My torso is average so I don't know what the deal was with the front edgie. I'm slightly under 5'4&#34; and the length of the jumper was perfect with (or without) a heeled sandal."
2.0,The belt was supposed to be a 36inch it was a 28.
2.0,hip area is cut way too wide for petite girls
2.0,The clasp is  not so sturdy is too big to fit through certain pendants which was unfortunate because it didn’t fit through the pendants that I got.
2.0,"The design was alright, was really hesitant to copping these but decided just to see if it was better in person. I didn't like that it was really big around the ankle area unlike most skinny jeans. Which sucked cause I was looking for a skinny pair just for this reason, I like jeans that compliment shoes when worn. Look's way better in the pic, and just had to return these cause I really couldn't rock these."
2.0,They weren't the right size for my watch so I had to return them.
2.0,Too long and get's tangled easily. I am 5'6&#34; and it was too big and long. Would not recommend for petite women.
2.0,No trae el vidrio
2.0,Didn’t feel the dress looked quite right. Was very long compared to what I expected
2.0,"Everything fit fine through the bodice, but the straps are way too long.  For a little girl, the top portion comes down much too low.  :(  We will need to tack the straps in the back to guarantee modesty.  Knowing how many other options there are out there, I would not purchase again."
2.0,Pretty shoe. Seems well made but has absolutely no padding or support on the inside. They are very stiff and uncomfortable. I will be returning.
2.0,"Really cute, but it was made really poor!"
2.0,Size is way off.. The boot itself is not very sturdy by the looks either.. If you do purchase order at a minimum a size larger
2.0,Arrived very cute. Definitely wider then it should be but I expected that from the other reviews. Unfortunately I washed this one time on delicate in cold water and the glitter disintegrated all over the shirt. Definitely bummed
2.0,My son loved it but after 1 wash it has holes throughout the shirt. Haven't owned these pajamas a week yet and they didn't make it through a single wash. Buyer-Beware!
2.0,I feel the hammer and sickle are way too large.  You can't see the whole thing while wearing the mask.
2.0,"They're ok. Look decent in photos, larger than. Expected. Easily chipped coating with regular use and case after one werk"
2.0,"Runs small. Should have listed to reviewers and ordered a size up. Am 5'4 and about 140 and was to too small, could barely move my arms and it was pretty uncomfortable... sequins were pokey!"
2.0,"Cute dress, bought the red sunflower dress however it is very snug. I usually fit in a 4 or 6 but neither fit. I tried an 8 as well as a 10 and the 10 had a better fit (little big though)-using as a bathing suit cover up."
2.0,"Okay these are not good for running. True they are not see through, but when I ran they went from my waist to my hips. I had to tug them up as I ran. Totally ruined my workout."
2.0,Was super excited about a sexy olive bathing suit to hide my momma warrior scars but this didn’t meet my expectations. Ordered a Medium. I am 5’9 145 and it was too big. Plus the white lining can be seen through the mesh part which was disappointing but the cut was probably my least favorite part. The cut around the but was very vintage. Not flattering on me. Will return.
2.0,"Poor quality and looks cheap, like a toy. One lens popped out of the frame the very 1st day after a 1ft fall on hard-wood floor. Not worth the price. I would not buy again."
2.0,"Well, I am a bit disappointed.  The pro's are obvious and the con's are not.  Here is my impression:<br />Pros:<br />- obviously delineates sections by 8 1/2 minute increments, colors are helpful.<br /><br />Cons:<br />-  This watch is tiny; the face of the watch is a little bigger than a quarter which means it is hard to actually see where you are at.<br />-  For those that like to set the watch on a table so it stands up, you can hardly make it do so because the wrist band is outwardly rounded...  therefore it won't sit flat - it is always tilled and is prone to falling over if you erase something or someone bumps a table, etc.<br />-  The ability to reset this watch is a bit ridiculous; the knob is TINY and difficult to pull out.  I find this design error humorous given this watch is suppose to be designed by a (or a couple of) Harvard and Stanford graduates....  anyone could have figured this out...  you need a knob you can pull out easily and quickly... you only have 15 seconds and you don't want to spend it fighting your watch in an already stressful situation.<br />-  The second hand isn't adjustable.  You only have two options, neither are good.  1) you just have to remember how many seconds it was past zero when you reset the watch (which is impractical and highly unlikely), or 2) you are just unsure of how many seconds you have left and you deal with it.  In sum, the second hand offers little benefit to the user of the watch on test day (or practicing for that matter).<br /><br />  I suppose I had too high of expectations, however, some of the flaws with this watch could have been addressed with some common sense.  It didn't help that the pictures showing this watch, don't give it context as to it's size.  Had I know it was so small I would have also known the knob would be a major issue.  My preference to stand the watch up on a table also makes this watch a bad fit.  The watch can get the job done, it is better than having a standard watch.  However, if you are going for ideal and specialized for the delightful occasion of taking the LSAT, I am not so sure this is what you want to use.  For an extra $30, you can get a Mastermind, which is what I will be getting after I return this one."
2.0,Not comfortable at all I don’t have a very wide foot and it squeezed my foot and they just aren’t comfortable wouldn’t recommend
2.0,Only for adults with big faces. This thing is huge. It was a waste of money for me.
2.0,need a little bigger in sleeve
2.0,No support. I bought this thinking there would be something to hold the girls up but there wasn't.
2.0,"Material is not what it looks like, super thin, elastic"
2.0,Ordered a small first. Too small around chest. Ordered a medium. Too long to be untucked. Disappointing
2.0,"Nice, but even with the largest size it was way too small for my 6'3&#34; and 250 lb husband."
2.0,"Update: after a few days of using it, the string got bigger and I couldn't adjust it to my wrist. I had to buy an elastic string thread every bead into the string to keep wearing them.<br />Still love it, but i needed to adjust it to my wrist<br /><br />Absolutely stunning. Love the lava stones, and the fact you can add any oil or perfume (i rather anything water based, so im able to change the scents as i want to) and be able to smell it through the day! I absolutely love the white lava stones!"
2.0,"These shirts aren't bad. They fit fine but constantly rise up when I'm working out, which gets really old fast!"
2.0,The purse is beautiful but the seller I would rate a 0. This is a 3rd party seller. They bought it and it shipped directly from American West. Purchased it on 12/13 with a promised delivery a few days before Christmas. It arrived 12/26.
2.0,Not very high quality and runs very small.
2.0,Way to big. I should have known better to not get a size bigger. The color was also not what I expected it to be. Instead of a blush color it was more like a coral.
2.0,no roman numerals as shown in the picture just full diamond face
2.0,Cheap & thin feeling.  Not thick flannel like you would find at Target or JCP
2.0,Very poorly constructed has separation at some of the seams
2.0,"Way too loose, I missed the return window so now I use it as a night gown"
2.0,"The dresses looks good, but it’s too short."
2.0,These sandals are cute but they are clunky and heavy.
2.0,"Poorly made and the enamel was so thick, it obscured the features of the cat."
2.0,Definitely better on the model than in person. The pattern on the sleeves is really strange and it just looks like two broken sweaters stitched into one. Not crazy about it and had to return.
2.0,I wish I had bought one with a buckle.  It is very plain looking and little tight.  I have a 31&#34; waist.
2.0,"I like the material and it is a very cute leotard. However, the sides under the arms are ridiculously large! I was going to return it, but I think I'm going to keep it and just take it in at the seams.  If you are not one to sew, then my advice is to forget about purchasing this because it really is way too big on the sides and your child's chest will be exposed."
2.0,Looks and feels great but runs very small. Not for long torsos
2.0,"Way too big, looks really odd when you put it on."
2.0,It looks very pretty but I need a functional  notification. I am dead in a few months and don't want to live in pain as a vegetable. The dog tag is OK. Not even the Catholic Church requires that a prolong life.
2.0,The pearl fell off the earrings couple day after I wear it
2.0,A mí hijo le gustaron mucho sus camisas pero me enviaron una talla equivocada ya que yo pedí 2 camisas talla 14-16 y 1 era talla 10-12 demasiado pequeña para el que mal ya que le gustaron mucho y 1 no la puede usar por lo pequeña
2.0,"This is not a jersey T-Shirt material, it is very clingy.  I ordered up a size and it was still too small through the bust and shoulders.  I ordered the purple and the color was very pretty and it is a nice length.  Other than that it didn't work for me.  I returned it this morning."
2.0,"These are super cute, but broke at the nose piece after almost two months worth of use. So I guess fragile kids glasses."
2.0,doesn't fit like the pictures shows at all... I got a medium and it back of it is like mid way at my back.
2.0,The leather is too stiff and the clasp is one that easily comes apart.
2.0,Didn’t really make a difference 😒
2.0,"Maybe it is just how I am shaped but I ended up looking like I was wearing a very pretty potato sack. It didn't fall off the shoulder like the one in the picture and it poked out on one side, looking almost like an inside out pocket. In theory this dress is amazing and may very well work for a smaller person, it did not however look flattering on me. At all. My husband, who usually has nothing to say about what I wear, just looked at it and said no. lol"
2.0,Runs VERY small!  They did allow me to return with no problem.
2.0,I thought I was ordering the 100% cotton t-shirt. The description shows that it comes in 100% cotton or the cotton + stretch version. It's not soft. It's itchy. The fabric is stiff and uncomfortable. I do like the cut.. because I have an hourglass shape. But will not wear it. Sad.
2.0,"I absolutely love these sunglasses they are well crafted but you guys have ruined it by making the front of the frame glossy by spraying some sorta shiny varnish stuff which is used on furniture. Why would you do that? They look like some fake crappy plastic now with all that gloss, you should have just left the raw wood effect that's the whole point of these sunglasses like how u have just left the arms alone without any polish. An absolutely perfect shades ruined because of this. I don't know about the rest of your clients but i don't like them polished and shiny or may be they have not noticed. The reason i bought them is because of the raw wood effect like the watch i have from another seller as you can see its not polished, just left alone in its own woody way or whatever you call it. I am leaving on vacation this weekend and was very much looking forward in taking these with me and now i have to get something regular locally. I am sorry but i am returning them."
2.0,"Great ring and it fit, but its fake material that turns your finger green."
2.0,Shirt is soft and the color matches picture<br />  however it is too big and the neckline is floppy and does not look good  :(
2.0,This top is the reason I am hesistant to buy clothing online. What I got was s top that was more pink mauve color and the style was not the same. It was more old fashion style and not even close to being off the shoulder and was fitted at the waist. Total rip
2.0,sad to sad false advertisement of my size and it didn't fit
2.0,Zipper broke within the first week of using. The rest of the purse seems to be good quality.
2.0,"Build quality is disappointing. The sewing at best average, especially considering it’s only sewed at points of stress. By far the best part of these are the locking clasps. I suppose for occasional use on dress clothes they might be sufficient but I were these daily as a detective and they are wearing out exponentially quicker than a competitors brand that I own for use with my patrol uniform. Unfortunate really because I love the clasp."
2.0,"Maybe this just doesn't work well for smaller gauges, but I have no ides how I'm going to get these in my ears. The flare is big, the plug length is short and they are super soft. It just bunches up when I try to put it in. FOr reference, I only have 8g openings. If they actually went in, I'm sure they would be a great product."
2.0,"After only wearing three times the earrings have started to turn!!  Seems to me they are plated, no where in the description does it say anything about these earrings being plated.  The two smaller pair which have not been worn at all are not pictured and the one earring in the upper right hand corner of the picture has not been worn either."
2.0,"Looks great but Does not hang well on a necklace. So, it is not really usable.<br />."
2.0,See through and way too small. I think the size are measured in Asian size. Beside wrong sizing and see through the dress does look like the picture.
2.0,It's very itchy. Have to wear something under it. This makes it lose its appeal
2.0,Cheap...plastic
2.0,"The dress was beautiful, but it had discoloration on the back and front. It almost looked like bleach or something got on it. I wanted to wear it for engagement photos, but the spot was too big to ignore"
2.0,Wanted to love these but they just didn’t look good on me.
2.0,I bought the large and an 11 year old undeveloped girl might have been able to wear them.  They were so cute though. I wish they had fit. Sad face….
2.0,I could hardly breathe in this mask
2.0,I purchased these in the hopes of getting some relief from the discomfort of plantar fasciitis! These are no different then another one of my other pairs of socks. They look the same and feel the same as my regular socks and there isn't even any compression and I can't even determine if there is any copper! Very Very disappointed!
2.0,"Nice material, but run very small."
2.0,Way to big.....continuously falls down.
2.0,Very small compared to picture --- Returned
2.0,cheap and made the skinniest girl look round.
2.0,"All rings same size so they only fit one, maybe 2 fingers. WTF? Also, they fall off. The X rings only fit over 1st knuckle and go flying off the instant my fingers were straightened. Can't wear. Can only wear the spiral ones and the bands."
2.0,I bought this watch as a gift for my husband. I ended up returning it. It looks cheap and for just under $200 it should look a little better.
2.0,It was a little too over the top with big stones. Also very tight. Would fit a child or small wrist better
2.0,The cream itself is very good to use.  The pumping mechanism made it completely useless after the first 3x using it.  I've had to unscrew the lid and scoop it out - so I only use it for personal use now.
2.0,"You get what you pay for. I thought I’d really love them when I first held them in my hand, they had a bit of heft like my old ray ban aviators did back in the 90’s.  The clarity of the lenses seems fine. Nothing special, but nothing to complain about. (Day #2) The honeymoon is OVER. One of the nosepieces just randomly fell off, there was no great jolt, nope just me removing the sunglasses from my head, The glasses came off the nosepiece stayed on my face and then fell to the ground. Fortunately(or unfortunately) I looked down and found it and attempted to some how get it back on, that’s when I noticed the poor construction, it looked it was attached by a cheap little jewelry clasp, should’ve sent them back then and there. However, I was headed to the beach for a couple of weeks with my family so rather than go through the hassle, I just kept them and kept putting the nosepiece back on when it would fall off. Of course you can imagine that wouldn’t last forever, eventually it was going to fall off and escape so that I couldn’t return it to its rightful, albeit crappy, place. The other problem I’m having, and maybe it’s just me but they are impossible to keep clean. I’ve owned and kept clean all sorts of sunglasses in my life and these seem to resist all efforts. I’m not going list the litany of cloth types and aqueous solutions I’ve tried, the seem to be perpetually smudged. In conclusion, maybe I got a bad pair, when they were in mint condition on day one my wife did tell me they looked good. It’s just that every day after that, they’ve been disappointing."
2.0,I wasn’t too impressed with the fit but it was very comfortable. Unfortunately it had a small tear on the sleeve that was very obvious so I had to return.
2.0,"Ordered a 2 XL, smaller than expected"
2.0,Plasticky and cheap looking
2.0,"The description of this item says ""genuine Lapis Lazuli"" but it feels and looks more like a genuine plastic knock off.<br />It looks pretty cheap and probably because it is.<br /><br />I ended up getting rid of this one and buying this Lapis piece instead: [[ASIN:B00D0X7160 Edgy Soul 'Protection and Enlightenment' Hematite and Denim Lapis Positive Energy Bracelet with Om Charm]]<br /><br />All this being said, if you like cheap, this is your bracelet! :)"
2.0,something I not buy again is all I say
2.0,Good price hats don't fit well
2.0,"It runs small , they are very narrow , the material does not strech!!"
2.0,I knew it was inexpensive but based on a previous Shagwear purchase I did not expect it to be so cheap. The &#34;agates&#34; are plastic and are placed poorly. Even after aging the metal with guilder's paste it wasn't fit to be the birthday gift I had intended. I quickly purchased a different item as the gift and used this purse as the package.
2.0,It has the worst seem that scratches you.
2.0,All the stones fell out within the first week
2.0,I ordered this for my 3 yr old dtrs halloween costume. I expected better quality for the price- ($11.99) But it was very flimsy and cheap. I probably could have found the same quality at the dollar store for WAY less. on the plus side- it came pretty fast. But probably will shop around next time.
2.0,Came with a missing stone. Fit well.
2.0,"They fit well, and are very soft. However, they are incredibly sheer, thin and is already coming apart."
2.0,"I read some reviews saying medium was plenty big for DD chest, um that’s a BIG NO!!! I got a medium. 36DD."
2.0,Can see everything plain as day
2.0,The stripes on the front of the shirt do not line up with stripes on back.
2.0,The sizing is all over the place with these. I ordered a 6 since my son currently measures at a 5.5. They arrived and were so large that they flopped around and just looked huge on him. Returned them for a smaller size and that size wouldn’t even go on his foot. Returned those and chose to buy locally and pay more for a different brand that are size 6 and fit perfectly.
2.0,The sandal looked great but was too small in the straps. My husband couldn't get his foot all the way in and he has two other pairs of Reefs that fit fine.
2.0,This shirt was cute online but not as cute when it arrived. The picture had a strange placement and didn’t look great.
2.0,"The material was see through and thin.  I ordered 7 of them and received 6 of one and 1 of a different dress.  The material was not acceptable.  They were to be a performance dress.  Even without stage lights, they were not acceptable."
2.0,Was very disappointed in the quality and did not think the actual pendant was as beautiful as the picture. Sent it back for a refund immediately. This would have been a gift for my daughter in law but just wasn't appropriate.
2.0,"They look great and feel greet but I'm an average size woman, avg. Built-I think. BUT these socks wouldn't even go up the legs of my 7yr old daughter! Maybe if you have EXTRA skinny bird legs these socks world be perfect!"
2.0,"No es verdad que parezca de cuero, por eso la ordene por que según era imitación de cuero"
2.0,They broke second time wearing them
2.0,Wore for a short time until the drawstring broke.
2.0,"plastic and cheap, do not buy"
2.0,"If only it was too small and fabric wasn't so thin. Not worth returning, so they're going into my fabric stash to be turned into something else."
2.0,these rosary beads are beautiful everything about them are beautiful except the fact that they turn after a few wears. my rosary beads got a little wet and started to rust very very quick
2.0,Very flimsy. Returned them
2.0,"I would have given 4 stars for size variety and a nice fit, but every single pair arrived with spots where the black paint is chipping off exposing the silver underneath."
2.0,"Very small sizing. Ordered Med which should be my size, couldn't even get my hand into them. Gave them to my wife who has tiny hands. Perfect fit."
2.0,"I really wanted to like these, given all the rave reviews here on Amazon and elsewhere. But they're see-through. And after only a couple wears they got a small but noticeable hole in the gusset (aka crotch). They also don't breathe particularly well, so they get pretty uncomfortable if you're doing anything intense. All in all, these are not pants I would buy again."
2.0,"I really love the look of this bracelet, but it broke less than a week and I am unable to wear this now."
2.0,The product looked cute and I was excited when it arrived. I immediately put it on my SUV and was excited to drive to work the next day. About 3 miles into my drive I heard a sharp pop and was hoping it wasn’t the antler. When I arrived at work the first thing I did was to check and I was so disappointed to see that one of the antlers was gone.
2.0,"I was really looking forward to this product because I gave my grandson the fleece cape that I usually throw around my shoulders when sitting up. I was very disappointed because this product is very thin, short and skimpy. I wear a 1X and this item is just too small. It would be more suited for a woman who wears a size small/medium. If you want to keep warm, don’t order this item."
2.0,Two of the four did not light. Very disappointing.
2.0,This is a beach wrap but I most probably will wear it to a pool.  It says no bleach but I’m thinking the chlorine may ruin this dress.
2.0,Broke too soon
2.0,The printing was fine but the fabric is not very soft
2.0,They look okay and fit nice but the hole for the button wasn't cut. It was closed and...the button fell off!
2.0,"I had the watch for a week and it fell apart on me.  I was walking/shopping, and I felt the strap loosen...  I looked down, and one side was coming off.  I slowly took the watch off, and a small screw or piece fell out... and we weren't able to find that piece on the ground.  Looking closer at the band... it actually broke off.  I'm not hard on my bands... so it literally fell apart."
2.0,"Don't bother. I ordered a large, just to be sure (I am so not a large). The waist is way too small. No button holes! I asked them (PIPA) about this issue and was told that I have to make my own holes! Really?? The zipper is way too short for the item, so the skirt hardly opens and would have to be put on and taken off over your head unless you have absolutely no shape at all. The fabric is nice and the stitching is nice, but the skirt just isn't made correctly."
2.0,"It's a nice lanyard. Only problem is the velcro has lost its ability to stay connected. Now my badge and lanyard keeps falling off. Very disappointing if this is supposed to be a official navy product. You would think it would be built to last. (It's not like I'm in the war zone, the thing wore out just holding my cac card)"
2.0,Small and Cheap fabric.
2.0,A nice glasses but can’t be use for prescription.
2.0,"Man I wish they didn’t send me someone else’s return. Kind of annoying to try and peel this stuff off. Other then that, the jersey is nice. Just playing it through my head how this occurred. Just sloppiness and carelessness of workers nowadays most likely."
2.0,"The Asian to US sizes noted are misleading.  The chest size was about right, but the length was waaaay shorter than traditional US sizes.  It barely reached my navel."
2.0,Not cotton a spandex material
2.0,"Sizes across the brand are inconsistent. I ordered a maxi dress and this one in the same size, one was too big and one was too small."
2.0,"Not a fan, way better shoes on the market."
2.0,Arrived crumpled and flattened
2.0,The bracelets fall apart easily. The knots and beads fell apart after 24 hours. I even tried to re-knot them but that only lasted another day. It’s a really cute idea but just not great quality in my opinion.
2.0,"I really wanted to love this dress, but the neckline is a bit odd. It has a small snap to provide a more modest neckline, but it falls way too high and creates a gap under the snap. Think of a tight button-down, that kind of gap. Without using the snap, it’s a bit too much cleavage, and the snap itself shows if not used. You would need to break the stitching holding the little snap to the dress for it to look polished if you weren’t using the snap closure. Overall I was disappointed. The fabric is nice, but the neckline ruins the whole dress."
2.0,"""Sparkles"" not real glittery as pictured."
2.0,Loses stick after several wears even if you wash it to get the &#34;sticky&#34; back.... never fits the way it did after the first 2-3 times
2.0,Feathers shed all over my home.  Didn't even start to wear the boa and feathers were falling off.  I would not buy again.
2.0,"Although the fabric of this skirt is high quality cotton, the stitching is not good quality. The bow and a button came detached when I tried it on for five minutes! Disappointed."
2.0,"Too small, material is not look nice as on the picture."
2.0,The hat is not Distressed or Vintage as described. It is brand new with Velcro not snap size adjustments
2.0,I was very disappointed with this product.  The fit was very strange because of the bra cup inserts - I ended up not wearing them.
2.0,"I knew this was small...but, sheesh!<br /><br />Worth maybe 5 bucks at best, and the chain might as well be a couple of strands of hair.<br /><br />Not recommended."
2.0,This anklet broke after 1 week. It was good while it lasted.
2.0,Only received 5 keychains. The other keychains were what I expected. Nice quality for price.
2.0,The pj’s are so cute and comfy. I thought a five until I washed them. I hung them dry as directed.  But the hearts on the pants stuck together. When I pulled them apart the vinyl ripped. So I’m very disappointed. I’m wearing them now for only the second time and they look terrible.
2.0,material very cheap. Nylon mix feels cheap
2.0,Nice looking reading glasses that you can throw into your pocket but they pinch my pretty average sized nose and my wife's (much more petite nose) WAY too much.  Very uncomfortable to wear.  Not made for most American faces.<br /><br />I also have a pair of Thinoptics which are incredibly comfortable and do not pinch at all.  Too bad - this is a nice design and good build quality.
2.0,The shoe was nice but the insole made it too tight and hurt it was not comfortable at all.  I bought new insole so I could wear them.  But why should I hand to buy new insole for new shoes?
2.0,Material is ok. The fit is nothing like the picture. Huge and sleeves are not proportional.
2.0,"The label show : Shell 100% polyester, Lining 100% polyester, Filling 100% polyester. Made in China. It is quite bulky and tough, not very flattering. Usage is limited."
2.0,Runs small. Order size up.<br />Cheap material. Cute to wear one time
2.0,Lasted about 2 months and then broke.
2.0,It’s not that it didn’t fit but it had a tighter fit around the middle it was strange
2.0,The bracelets were to small.... super tight on a average mans wrist.
2.0,I did not like the orange straps....keep it neutral bkack
2.0,"These are cute but mine came with stitching little torn for all of them. Being in my third trimester and total bed rest, I have no time to fix these. Don't know if I should be contacting the seller or not. Thinking either to get a refund or replacement may be. Because I need newborn hats when the baby comes. Also, the bow is smaller than what's been described by the seller. Very sad because the stitches are torned!"
2.0,"Very disappointed in this band.  I had bought the black band, which is elegant and comfortable to wear.  This brown band is stiff, difficult to buckle, and showed wear almost from the time I began wearing it.  The leather is stiffer than the black band, and it seems shorter.  I buckle the black band in the 8th hole from the end; I buckle the brown in the 5th hole from the end.  I would much prefer to have the exact same leather and look of the black band in a brown band.  Just saying."
2.0,I loved this ring for about three weeks until the finish (rose gold plating?) started chipping. This makes me sad because it was so beautiful when I got it. I got so many complements too. But now it’s chipping and turning my finger green. Maybe if you don’t get it wet it might last longer? Still. Disappointing.  😕
2.0,"I'm 5""2"". I put this on, and it almost split me up the middle. I do not have a long torso. I have a regular proportional torso, so I was amazed that it was trying to crawl up labia and make friends with my insides. It will most certainly be a thong unless it is altered.  I made the mistake of ordering it too close to the event that I had to wear it to (group thing) so I cut the crotch and added *FIVE AND HALF INCHES* of 2"" black elastic band and attached it with eye hooks. This ended up being a brilliant save because I had not realized trying it on (as I was distracted by the intense splitting on my neither region) that there is no way to use the bathroom in this unless you disrobe completely! It was not an easy costume to get completely on, and if you wear all the straps to look cool (and I recommend that) it would take some time. Because I had made the alteration, I was able to easily unhook and use the bathroom- though I assume pulling it to the far right to go pee might work in a pinch.  The other thing that happened was that the skull ""melted"" off. I ran in it, and the heat and moisture caused the plastic skull to peel up and off from the underside.<br />Because i was forced to alter it to make it wearable, and because the design patch lasted only 1 outing, I'm giving this 2 stars. But I will say, the straps look great, and the material is very durable, so it has that going for it."
2.0,I like how sturdy it is but I do not like that there are two shades of blue that do not match.  The eyes are one shade and then the body is another shade of blue.  The picture doesn’t really capture it to much because of the lighting but it was the first thing I noticed when I opened the package.  I wish I would’ve known this before buying.
2.0,Now I am pretty cheap when it comes to sunglasses... like $5 Walmart cheap. These almost feel cheaper than Walmart. The whole thing feels like plastic. I don't think these are worth $15. The design is cute but way to cheap feeling. Also the lenses are a little to small. I like mine to be a little bit bigger.
2.0,"On my opinion they look cheap, and I mean they were cheap but still, they don’t look as advertised. I was disappointed ☹️"
2.0,2 of the 6 were broken/defective.
2.0,Terrible quality. I bought this watch as a gift for my husband and it lasted for about 7 months before it started beeping and there was no way to turn the beeping off. It had to be locked in the car so the battery could die. It was used according to instructions. We have send the watch back to Nixon for repair but after few months the same problem reoccurred. Nixon does not offer refunds so we had to accept an exchange product. We will sell it online. No more Nixon.
2.0,Way too big for a woman. Bought for costume and did not end up using.
2.0,Broke the second time wearing it Sorry I purchased two and it happened to the other one also
2.0,These feel ok but both my husband and I still get light coming in through the bottom. We don't use them. It was a waste of money for us.
2.0,This product was provided at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review.<br /><br />I was not fan of this dress. It runs at least 2 sizes too big. It looked like a garbage bag on me. I would not purchase it again.<br /><br />I take leaving reviews seriously. I read customer reviews to help me decide what purchases to make. I only leave positive reviews for good products. If you find this review helpful please let me know by selecting “YES” where asked below “Was this review helpful to you?”
2.0,The color of it was great.  I would have liked it if it had some fit to it.  Just way to big  I finally got it returned
2.0,Looks nice but it is too big for my wrist.  There is no adjustment to make it fit tighter on my wrist. It will be returned.
2.0,"I knew from the description, how big(read:small) they were going to be, but nothing like seeing them for real to realize just how small they really are and, since they're 100% cotton, they probably shrank in the dryer.  Also, they're so thin, you could probably read through them.  I wish I'd paid a little more for a larger size and better quality.  The only positive things I have to say are that they arrived quickly, they were cheap, and the colors are bright and vibrant."
2.0,Disappointed! This would have perfect without the hole. Shirt came with a hole in the neck line.
2.0,"This was a disappointment. Although it fit the way it was supposed to, it didn’t WEAR the way it was supposed to. The seam, which was not a true empire waist, kept popping up over my boobs and resting on TOP of my chest instead of under them. Awkward and uncomfortable fit. I returned it."
2.0,This dress is huge. Size down at least twice. It was also  also very long on my 5’1” frame.
2.0,So like I though it was a like a beach tote bag ... Its cute but small. Also be cautious of the material ... very cheap
2.0,Just hung like a huge sack. Very unflattering. Good color though.
2.0,"Super sad. My daughters BFF bought the same item from WISH so my daughter wanted one.  Bought it on Amazon so we wouldn’t have to wait weeks to get it, but this item faded after the first wash and the material just doesn’t hold up. On the other hand the same item from WISH still looks brand new after multiple washes"
2.0,It runs really small & the material is itchy!
2.0,The color did not look same as the picture.
2.0,The dress is so short it looks more like a mini-mini dress. I will send it back<br />The color are not as pretty and rich as in the picture
2.0,"Felt they were cheaply made so I guess I got what I paid for. Also, the padding around the edges was coming away and / or twisted away from the sunglasses."
2.0,Thought it’d be tan but it’s more like orange creamsicle. Completely see through tho! So can only wear around the house. It is comfy tho ;)
2.0,"I ordered a 10 in this shoe because I like extra room in my slides/sandals. I hate for my toes or my heel to hang off the front or back. To my surprise a 10 was too small. What!? Ok no problem, I returned the 10 and ordered a size 11 and it fit the same way 😫. I have never worn a shoe in a size 11 smh and the fact that it fit the same way the 10 did was alarming. I returned the 11 too"
2.0,color change within a week of wear...it's beautiful but.............
2.0,I am a 34 top and this item was way too large. It also had a hole in the sleeve.
2.0,Order them for our twin grandboys. We received them on 9 July 2021. They only wear them on their weekends visit.
2.0,Very large especially around the waist.
2.0,"Much too short, unfortunately. They are lightweight and feel nice, but the very bottom of the cuffs hit the top of my ankle, and that was with NO additional fabric from the pantleg blousing over the cuff - just straight taut fabric from hip/crotch area to the cuff  :(<br />I am 5'6&#34; tall with a 31&#34; inseam. I bought an XL. According to the size chart provided by the seller in their written description of this product (NOT the cookie-cutter &#34;Amazon Size Chart&#34;), Size XL fits:  Waist: 26&#34; - 32&#34;. Length: 41.5&#34; Their 41.5&#34; measurement is obviously meant to be from the top of the waist to the bottom of the cuff (not inseam), but even then it's a couple inches shy, and certainly doesn't allow extra fabric to blouse over the cuff, the way harem pants are intended to fit."
2.0,Picture not true to color it has a white band

But this is important information to the storyline, so it is important to pay attention to it. I didn't and had to re watch that section to answer some questions. This drama revolves around a woman, Eun Jae, who was taken advantage of while drunk and it resulted in her pregnancy and marriage to him. She unfortunately lost the baby when she was pushed around by her mother in laws brother and fell down the stairs. His mother treats her no better than a servant and is abusive to her. She puts up with everything as she now loves her husband. She is from a poor family and that is part of the reason she's so mean to her. The couple have been married 7 years and don't have children. The cheating husband sleeps around with a lot of women. He slept with the wife's best friend Ari immediately after coming back from their honeymoon. He says that he lost his feelings of love for his wife the instant he saw Ari's butt. Apparently that happened three times total. She has left for 5 years and is back to make the husband hers. She immediately seduces the husband again, maybe hours after coming back. Ari has a son that she claims is his. She forces the issue to get him divorced, even though the current wife is pregnant. Because his father will only recognize the wife's baby as an heir. These two women were raised as sisters and Ari was engaged to the brother of the family. The husband has decided that he no longer wants his wife or baby and tried to force her to abort the baby. But instead he ends up trying to kill her. The husband then believes that he was successful. But unfortunately for him she survives and comes back for vengeance. The husband and Ari are now a couple and get married. They become a family with their son and live with his family. They get divorced later on in the show too. They better watch out now, she's back for revenge. She is rescued by a man who's sister supposedly committed killed herself in the same place. He thought it was his adopted sister at first, who tried to kill herself because she is obsessively in love with him. He only sees her as a sister. He now helps the woman he rescued but she runs away and takes his dead sisters name. The Eun Jae can't get over the death of her unborn baby. But don't expect this to be a very interesting type of revenge. And now she has teemed up with someone else who wants to destroy the father. His father stole her fathers land, money and her baby that she refers to as Star. This is her new mother, who helps her.  The man who rescued her is this persons adopted son. They manage to destroy the family and get revenge by making them loose everything. The ex husband sill goes back and forth between the two women. The adopted son and Eun Jae fall in love but the obsessive adopted sister comes back. She still loves the brother and is supposedly so crazy that the mom has them marry. They are unhappy as he loves the woman he rescued. The original sister is evil and so is Ari. Even toward the end I could care less about them and Ari having a fatal illness. Or what happened to the husband and Ari in their final moments of life in the show. Sorry, if I spoiled something for you. The only good moments are with the Aunt who seems to have a disability that makes her childlike. She thought that she got pregnant because she slept on a bed holding hands with the brother of the first wife, Eun Jae. They are really cute together. But you have to wait until season two to see much though. She is in love with him but can it amount to anything? What happens when these two want to get married? If I could edit this myself, it would only be a story of them. This is the worst plot line ever. I almost fell asleep countless times while watching it. Because I bought it, I had to watch it to the end. I'm considering giving it to my friend, but I like her more than that. Maybe it will just stay in my drama cabinet.<br /><br />This drama is best to watch in small amounts of episodes at a time. I write reviews for dramas and CDs from Korea,Taiwan,China,and Japan. THERE'S A DRAMA FOR THAT"
2.0,"Beware of the sizing. I wear a 12 and this was HUGE. It was going to cost me $9 in postage to send it back (item was $11) so I altered it myself.  If you don't sew, go for a size to two smaller than you wear. It also came with a black smudge on the front, but I was able to get it clean in the wash."
2.0,Not a real sweatshirt. Made out of nylon or something.
2.0,"The tops are to small / tight. Shorts are bigger n fit but like they dont go with shirt size? Same size , 6x . Thought it was good deal but if I dry them probably wont fit her at all."
2.0,Product fits fine but is very uncomfortable. There’s part of the shoe that runs hard against my ankle bone making it impossible to wear for any length of time. Better off spending more money for a quality shoe.
2.0,The product was too large and I ordered my normal size. It's also long. Fell right at the knees
2.0,"It's so hard to find simple outfits for kids these days.  They all have characters or logos and such on them.  I saw this and really liked it.  I still do like it, but the pants are bigger than I would expect based on how clothes normally fit my son.  I bought  3T as my son is fluffy round the mid-section and normally buying 1 size up will let clothes fit more comfortably and last longer.  These pants keep sliding down when he's running around.  It's not a BAD thing, just odd in how off the sizing is.  The shirt fits well and overall I'm happy with the purchase.  Maybe it's the elastic on the waistband vs. the sizing, but it's odd.  ** Update, after washing, the neck hole is now so small it hurts my son to put the shirt on.  We won't be buying this brand again."
2.0,Hat itself comfortable. Team logo just an iron on. Disappointed.
2.0,Two of the 6 pair of underwear shrunk after washing. The two pairs are so small there is no way they will ever be useful. Can I possibly get those two pairs replaced? The two that shrunk are the dark gray and the turquoise blue.
2.0,slip off the heel
2.0,After owning a KidKraft Kitchen (my Jack Russell ruined with tinkle) I purchased this because I didn't want to spend a lot of $ for I have only one grandchild left (at present) that is young enough.  It arrived in a real FLIMSY box and parts were broken but I got some wood glue and a clamp and got through it.  The directions STINK!  Was really difficult but once complete it was cute but not as tall or as well made as the KidKraft I had owned before.  I would NOT recommend this product to anyone. Waste of $ & Time!
2.0,It’s pretty. Broke after 1 day I wore it. Cheaply made.
2.0,Deceiving pictures compared to actual product
2.0,"I bought the first one and the keychain was for a mother which worked for my mom, the 2nd one I ordered had a description of a keychain but it isn't a keychain it is a metal credit card. I love the inspirational message but definitely remove the keychain title."
2.0,"It fits well, it's comfortable--but it doesn't look anything like the picture.  And none of the other colors being offered look anything like it either.  The color I picked had broad teal and light blue stripes with a gray background.  This has mostly tiny stripes (which is fine) but it's a white background and it has pink? It's bizarre.  I don't dislike it enough to return it and I need some lightweight long sleeved shirts (and I got a really good deal on prime day) but I probably would have picked a different color if I had realized it would look like this."
2.0,"I wore them twice, and the whole pin came out of one of the earrings when I removed them. Sad…I really loved them."
2.0,It has poor quality with the sewing .
2.0,Smaller than initially expected. 2 were usable.
2.0,"The piece is not the size, gauge or length, included in the product description. I plan to return to Amazon and to avoid this supplier."
2.0,Like 2 sizes too small
2.0,Poor quality<br />Strangely long and tight
2.0,I didn’t like how small it was a 3xl was the size of an xl
2.0,"Good quality, but not true to size. Runs large."
2.0,This is much smaller than it looks online.
2.0,Too big for my 8 yr old sons head.  Slips constantly. More adult sized
2.0,These broke after 2 months
2.0,"The material of the hat was everything I expected and exactly what I paid for, but the size! There's no stretch or give to it AT ALL and there is no way my 7 month old was getting his head in this hat! It's really small, may be good for a newborn or an infant, but not much bigger at all."
2.0,"cheap, tangles easily"
2.0,"Ok, earring larger then I thought"
2.0,Super cute dress but definitely not an XL. I bought another dress in the same size and it fit. An XL probably fits a person who usually wears M or maybe an L.
2.0,"I wasn't very satisfied with these earrings. They are so cute but when I took them out of the package, they were way more flimsy than I was expecting. These were some of the more expensive ones I found on amazon so I thought they would hold up. The packaging was very cute."
2.0,Very lovely but doesn’t fit my wrist.  Very small
2.0,Retuned too small
2.0,There is no ponytail hole. The picture and description both indicated there would be one.
2.0,"Really thick and un omfotable for my sensory kid.  NOT returnable, contrary to ad."
2.0,The leopard print has grey or silver it isn't the way the picture looks.
2.0,"They were soft, and a nice width, but they aren't very stretchy at all and came right off within minutes... over and over. I chose these specifically because they claimed that is what these are good at - staying on. Uh... not so much! (Not a big fan of the color choices either, but... I knew that before I hit ""buy"".)"
2.0,"Ugly shirt, boxy, no shape."
2.0,The shoe is very cute but stretched our very quickly.  One shoe is falling apart and it hasn't even been worn a dozen times yet.  I wouldn't buy this shoe again.
2.0,I ordered red and the color I received looks orange. I haven't tried it but it looks like it's true to size. The fabric might be see through... I'm really disappointed because of the color but if I keep it I'll use it to do yoga or chores at home.
2.0,cute for like a week then the zipper snapped off. it would've been my favorite skirt had that not happened.
2.0,"The ball feels good, nice touch and control however does not hold up to our street games. Nice try nike, improve and build a better ball for STREET."
2.0,This is sold as a one size.  I am normally a large and there was no way I could get this on.  The coloring in the picture is also much brighter then what it actually is.
2.0,Stones are dull - not a vibrant blue like a kyanite should be. No chateuency at all.
2.0,Setting pon comes out too easily with just the slightest touch causing constant inaccurate time
2.0,Jacket needed hook and eye or something to lay right
2.0,"The color and fit were beautiful. Unfortunately,  the way it was sewn, the pockets flaired out and made my hips look extra large. Sent it back."
2.0,Nice looking but band is hard and inflexible  very little stretching to give a level of comfort
2.0,The “bow” is actually a strip of fabric that you have to tie but the disappointing thing is that it’s not long enough to make a bow... the hat is ok and the shorts are the star of the show. The onesie felt super cheap and the neck was all stretched out. She ended up wearing it for one pic and I changed her.
2.0,Cheap (obviously).  I have what most consider to be small ears and this still didn't fit me.  The material is a decent quality for something so inexpensive and the dragon's head was nicely detailed.  Maybe this earring is better intended for a child's ear.
2.0,"Most of the reviews say this item runs big, but I still ordered the size my 2 year old usually wears. It did not fit him right and I had to return it. The arms were to long and yet the legs were much to short. The body of the outfit was also very baggy and wide, but to short/tight in the length (shoulders to butt)"
2.0,Pretty but they are not glued that good to the foundation plug that goes inside the shoe.
2.0,the balls unscrew themselves. they both fell off
2.0,"Adorable swimsuit, totally wonky construction. The breast padding is perfectly circular, which might work for someone less than an A cup, maybe a small B, but otherwise the padding is set too high so you end up with the dreaded &#34;double bubble&#34; that makes you look like you have four boobs. If you have a bigger chest (C or bigger), you will need to remove the circular shaped padding and replace it with something more natural or else there won't be any support. The padding is in between two layers of fabric, rather than a built-in shelf bra, so without that padding there is zero support. And because the padded cups are set so high, there is zero support. Between the upper bra part and the boy shorts, it is connected by very stretchy fabric that doesn't have any spandex in it at all. The top of the suit does, the boy shorts do as well, but nothing in the middle. And when you squeeze the top and the bottom, and not the middle, guess where it all gets pushed out? The shoulder straps and the back top of the suit were great, and I like the little bit of fabric that covers where the cleavage plunge would be, and the material itself (the suit, not the middle section that holds the top and bottom together) is comfortable, but the proportions are just so bizarre. The overlay skirt is the same as well. The picture shows it looking like it comes down free flowing from right underneath the breast, but it actually doesn't go out until it hits your waist about halfway down. It's not a true empire waist, more like a super short mermaid style where it's close fitting at the top and then it widens at the bottom. The way the attached boy shorts fit is off. There is too much fabric in the crotch area - compared to other suits I have that space is three times the size it should be, like someone had a thigh gap of four inches or so. If it weren't that wide that much fabric, it would fit better. Overall, the suit fit small. I ordered my normal size plus one a few sizes up just in case. The one in my size didn't fit well at as the padded chest area was even higher than the oversized one, smaller padded circle cups, but the boy shorts were still wide in the crotch area. Actually, the only difference between the two sizes I could tell is the top. The larger size had more room for the chest and slightly bigger padding circles, but that's it. The rest of the suit fit the same, was cut the same, same material, etc.<br /><br />I am truly disappointed this suit didn't work out for me. If you have a big chest, an apple or pear shaped body, or just a larger tummy, this looks like it will be a flattering suit, but the way the middle fits it unfortunately isn't. If you carry your weight equally over your body and have smaller chest, then give this a try."
2.0,"I washed it thinking it would get rid of the plastic chemical smell.  I was wrong. My son won't wear it, so it was a waste of money."
2.0,Frayed almost immediately at end and holes. Will not last.
2.0,"These leggings are super soft and the colors are great but soon as I got them in, I washed them like I do all orders and the seam has holes already just from washing. The material is super soft but very thin. Won’t purchase again."
2.0,for women with no bust are very small
2.0,"I really liked the look of this shoe, seems to be decent quality.  I ordered my regular size 10.  Unfortunately, the toe area is too narrow and short.  I don't have a wide foot.  The heel fit fine.  It doesn't come in a 10.5, if it did, I would have exchanged it.  I think 11 would have been too big."
2.0,This is not warm! I am curvy and although the sizing is good it fits wanky!!!! Not flattering at all
2.0,"I should have expected this because of what I paid for it, but this is and looks like a cheaply made necklace"
2.0,"VERY DISSAPOINTING. IT IS OF VERY POOR QUALITY. THE STRAPS ARE TOO SHORT AND EVENTHOUGH THE DESIGN IS CUTE, THE BAG IS GROSSLY OVERPRICED."
2.0,wore it a few times and had noticed the time was wrong almost every time i put it on. i went to wear it today and it had stopped working completely. ive only had it a few weeks and was severely disappointed.<br /><br />pros:<br />looks sleek<br /><br />cons:<br />doesnt keep time well<br />product material picks up a lot of dust<br />stopped working soon after purchase
2.0,Okay for price. Not wellput together. Disproportionate arms for the robe. They are extremely wide and very short. Not overly impressed and wouldn't purchase again.
2.0,"Can't read names are so tiny, it also looks cheap. I would not recommend it. If I would had seen it personally I would not pay more than $5.00 for it. very disappointed"
2.0,the screw fell out after 3 weeks of having the damn earrings was very upset and dissapointed because i felt like i was really ripped off
2.0,Poor quality. Crystal fell out as soon as I opened.
2.0,The rings themselves look really nice and fit well. My only issue is that they are two pieces and my husband has lost the patterned part on all three rings now in about a month because they come apart. And they look ridiculous without the design part so they’re now useless and I have to buy him a new one. I won’t be buying these again!
2.0,I wasn't expecting the back to be so much longer than the front. Also the holes in the front show a lot of cleavage.
2.0,"I didn't anticipate the fleece lining sticking to my clothes and riding up. I ended up giving this coat away. That said, it was warm."
2.0,I was hoping for something better since so many of the reviews were pretty good.  The color of the tutu didn’t match the leotard.  Perhaps this is just the case with the ballet pink?  The tutu doesn’t seem to be sewn on securely enough for an actual toddler to wear regularly to dance class.  This would likely be better for a Halloween costume with less use.  This is a very cheap outfit so for the price I believe you get what you pay for.
2.0,"Don't know if I just got a bad dress compared to other reviewers or what, but it is definitely not a swing dress. The waist is tight, and I had to put it over my head carefully to prevent any possible tear. It fits more like an A-line dress than a shift/swing dress. I bought a L based on the chest sizes given, and there is so much space above my chest. The skirt is also VERY uneven, as pictured. The right side was much higher than the left. I did buy this hoping it would be a cute maternity dress, but you can see in my side photo that it's more comfortable with the waist band sitting on top of my belly. The band looks like it's supposed to have an elastic band behind it for stretch too but it does NOT. Like I said, the dress definitely has potential, but it needs work. I will be returning this item. Might buy one of the thin strap ones to try in the future and review as well."
2.0,"Top creates a uniboob, the shorts while snug arent too tight but the seam literally seriously goes right in the middle of where it shouldn't be--- major camel toe, ive never had this issue woth leggings or bathing suits, but with these shorts it's like im advertising- the design however is adorable the print is great-"
2.0,"I really like the look of this swimsuit but it really is for a taller woman. As a shorter woman 5’3 120lbs there is extra material and husband said it looks funny/ baggy on me. I based the size I got based on what the size chart said, but I guess I should have gone smaller."
2.0,I usually wear a medium...but this coat runs very small!<br />I liked the coat itself but it was way to tight in the shoulders...no way I could have worn it.
2.0,"Cheaply made, but it will do the job I guess."
2.0,"I purchased this as a ""travel"" eyeglass case for my son who loves cars.  The red and black cases were nestled together pretty tightly.  I can see how some people might mistaken that they only got 1 case vice 2.  The first thing I noticed is that both cases have a strong chemical smell, and I didn't want to put my son's glasses all cooped up in a chemical smelling case.  I let it air out for 2 weeks and the smell didn't get any weaker.  I tried spraying it down with rubbing alcohol, lightly rinsing it with soap and water, and the smell would not get weaker!  Finally, I sprayed it with one of my perfumes, and I don't know if it masks the chemical smell or the material absorbed that instead, but I finally didn't smell the chemical smell.  My 2 star review is based on the chemical smell that just wouldn't go away.  It is a pretty roomy case that any normal glasses would rattle around in.  There's no sharp edges, so don't think it would damage the glasses, but we put his glasses in a eyeglass bag and then put the bag into the case.  I like how it can clip onto a bag.  The outside is not a hard shell case that would protect the glasses from being broken if smashed, but it's a structured case that has some give.  It provides a little more protection than leaving it on the ground.  I like it because you can attach it to a bag and not worry about it being accidentally flung off a table or stepped on or forgotten.  If it didn't have that chemical smell that was so hard to get rid of, I would have given it more stars."
2.0,"Do not buy these bibs.  Cheaply made - small hole appeared after worn once.  Zippers at the leg bottoms do not stay in place and ride up exposing ankle.  Fit as expected, and fleece interior is warm."
2.0,"Lights worked for a few days, and the the left stopped working."
2.0,Comfortable but does not block sound well
2.0,The &#34;XL&#34; slippers were much too small for my size 12 feet but Amazon provided an effortless means for returning them with no cost to me. Excellent system for achieving  customer satisfaction.
2.0,I love the coat it's awesome! I just wish the piece of fur that goes on the hood would have came with the jacket.
2.0,"I have two other dresses from ROMWE.  Was disappointed at the fabric here (which looked swingy and fun) being stiff, stretchy, stuff.  Probably on me for not reading clearly but still a bummer based on this pic."
2.0,The earrings are pretty heavy and more of a solid blue color unlike the ones pictured.
2.0,Definitely looks better in pics.  The chain snapped off literally the first time I removed the pin end.
2.0,Not soft. Too thick. Too small.
2.0,"For the price of these glasses I expected more than the glasses I have bought for $15.00. However, I did not see any major difference with the glass lenses.<br />With a few weeks of wearing them the left hinge broke, and has made the glasses uncomfortable to wear."
2.0,"Good idea in theory... I guess if you don't have a tight fitting or sheath dress/shirt, this might be a good product. The strap needs to be tight enough to hold everything in place. Even if you're relatively thin, this will cause your skin to bulge on either side of the strap. I knew this would happen when I bought it, but I didn't realize just how noticeable it would be."
2.0,Its a vneck  and skin tight
2.0,"For sure, a product like this is something you get to use once or twice before it falls apart - so no expectation of super comfort or durability. I bought it for a Christmas-themed event at my son's summer camp. It arrived with defunct lights, but there was no time to arrange a replacement. He wore it without the lights working and got some laughs. Put it in the trash when he got home."
2.0,Sizes run small but a size or 2! Kiddo is a size 8. Ordered a 10 to have some growing room and they were to tight and small. Size 12 is a perfect fix with no room to grow. Definitely order a size or two larger.
2.0,"Haven't even had a chance to use it yet.  It's been &#34;airing out&#34; for 20 days as the bag reeks of off-gassing from the materials.  Seems like decent material except that the inside of the bag scratches very easily and leaves white streaks, can be done with your fingernail with hardly any pressure.  Not a deal breaker, as its the inside.  But this bag stinks to high heaven.  Will update once I get to actually use it."
2.0,"T-shirt is low quality and runs a bit small. Love the logo, just was hoping for better quality."
2.0,"After only a few months’ use last winter and the warmer seasons in storage (hung in a coat closet), it no longer stays on. It doesn’t work anymore."
2.0,Came without the bow thing. Another shirt I bought from this company had make up stains on it. Another came without a tag. Would not recommend.
2.0,Every thing fine. But I need bra pad support
2.0,I ordered the XXLarge expecting much more material. I am normally a 1x with room. This did not even close in the front.
2.0,I really liked it but the size 5 fit more like a 6. I didn't return cause I liked so give to someone.
2.0,"Replacement fits like a glove, very comfortable but it's difficult to clean. Do not get sea/lake water on it or sweat. It will always have an odor to it after that happens. Even if you clean it daily or immediately after the activity it still happens."
2.0,Nice but where is the watch?
2.0,A little cheap looking...low quality
2.0,It looks great on photo but in reality very poorly made face mask with low quality materials. The color is very faded version of the photo.<br />Not worth what it is selling for.
2.0,Please be careful many of these items are magnet!!!
2.0,"I'm 175 5'4"" bust size 36DD and material was too silk like, didn't flatter my curves"
2.0,tiniest charm u ever saw...total rip off
2.0,Very tight and nice in legs but hangs horribly in seat and crouch area. Will be returning these
2.0,Probably won't wear it as the material is way too thin
2.0,The dress was too small and I ordered one size larger per the reviews and recommendations. Not sure what size I received because the size was no where on the dress or the tags.
2.0,my normal size didn't fit so if you're buying any of these products and you are a little bigger gal be careful sizing is way off. and is very tight in places uncomfortable to sleep in.I liked the feel of the gown and it does look cute for summer just wish it fit better and was true to size fits like a large if that. in cold wash the  colors ran be sure to wash alone if possible
2.0,I drop tested it with something of similar weight to my camera and snapped right off and since I’m clumsy I need these thing to work work 🤣😂
2.0,Ordered a large didn't fit right
2.0,"Nice and soft on the outside, but NOT plush (like they said) on the inside - really rough texture. Not comfortable at all."
2.0,Item beautiful when arrived but very quickly started to stretch and unravel.  Now unattractive and unbearable.
2.0,Pretty but runs large in armpit area
2.0,I got this delivered in a ring box which made the chain tangled! Took my step dad 2 days to try and get it untangle! Delivery took almost over a month! I won’t buy it! Cheap looking too
2.0,"The Velcro won't stick after about 2 weeks. The zipper broke, I had to end up using the cut off part of the zipper to zip of the waist trainer plus I had to  cut the Velcro part off and just use the belt part the tore up zipper is on."
2.0,Can find better value in local sales.
2.0,I would not recommend this piece of jewelry. It’s just a really long piece of elastic string that is already tearing.
2.0,It was a bit tight around the croch area. Very snug fit and uncomfortable if you do a lot of running workouts. I generally wear L from other brands and this one is definitely tighter. My waist is 34.
2.0,"The one side looks great, but the other side is totally different. It's alright for the price."
2.0,My son loved them when he got them. They gave him the look of plugs. But maybe a month after getting them one of the black piece with the dragon on it fell off of the metal. Not happy!
2.0,"The collar was wider than I thought it would be, so personally didn't like it but it fit fine."
2.0,"While the dress looks very pretty, the material is thin and cheap.  If you're purchasing, I would size up as it is not uniform throughout if you are larger in certain areas.  I am a true medium and this fit skin tight across the chest."
2.0,Normally wear 2xl and its slightly baggy on me<br />This was super tight and form fitting and thin material so you could see the black bra band through the fabric<br />Def glad i tried it on before taking it to an anime convention i was going to wear it at
2.0,The bands look great and feel very comfortable against the skin. My problem with these is their durability. These bands rip at the pins fairly easy compared to other brands. The band in this picture ripped after 2 months of use. Going to have to start buying from somewhere else until they make these stronger.
2.0,Cheap one use and one wash and they have wholes
2.0,"I'm typically a 4 and I ordered a 4, but it's just too small. I wanted to wear it to a friend's wedding, but it looked more like a cheap club dress. Had to return."
2.0,"I spent more on shipping for these cheap quality shoes than what they are worth.  Not happy, don't waste your time and money!"
2.0,Very very tiny doesn't cover boobs! And I bought a large and my boobs are medium size.
2.0,Very Small and the fabric was more like a man's cotton tank top not very stretchy  Not what I expected.
2.0,Too tight/small for my two year old. Couldn’t get his normal chubby toddler size hands in them. A shame b/c looks like good quality. No one has patience for that when dealing with little ones!! Nor did he!
2.0,Shirt does NOT come loosely fit like the pic. It's cute but it fits VERY SMALL!
2.0,"The box I received had an ostrich picture, upon opening the box, to my disappointment it was not an ostrich costume. It was a dinosaur costume. Regardless, I still very much enjoyed the costume even though it was not what I wanted."
2.0,"the bigger ball is odious, very unattractive in my ear. the only way i would wear these is just with the smaller balls.... both just looks like they threw the rhinestones on!"
2.0,The openings are too tight.
2.0,The material is not the material in the photo. Disappointed.
2.0,Doesn't stay onnn
2.0,"Umbrella great. But, no tie when down. Stand; cheap. Metal NOT strong enough to withstand coastal FL breezes. Light weight only. Shame."
2.0,The material is very thin and wrinkles!
2.0,Like but too small
2.0,The shirt is definitely not as long as it shows in the picture. Its actually pretty short. Not what I was looking for!
2.0,TWO SMALL N THEY DONT ACCEPT RETURNS
2.0,Way too small. Not true to size
2.0,"These tanks are cute, but waaaay too small.  I wear a D bra, and the XL was skin tight on me.  It looks like it was junior sizing.  Too bad I had to return, because the colors and material are very cute."
2.0,"Body fits good and slim, however if you work out the arms are wayyyyy toooo tight."
2.0,Not what I expected. The bag was a little smashed and wrinkled when I received it and it looks cheaply made. :/
2.0,"Unfortunately, I thought this jacket ran very small and the material wasn't as strong as I would have thought."
2.0,Very cheaply made. A lot more boxy in shape than the picture.
2.0,"I originally loved this band, it was comfortable and exactly what I wanted. I purchased on September 9, 2021 and by November 9, 2021 the pin that holds the band on the watch broke and I did not receive replacements when I ordered the band. The color is also coming off the band. I wanted so much to love this band and it to last for more than 2 months."
2.0,"The fit in between the toes is uncomfortable, like the toes are cut short and makes them too tight. I am a shoe size 8 or 8 1/2 depending on the brand of shoe."
2.0,"The ear piece broke off after 4 months, nit worth the price."
2.0,"Material is very stiff and hard, feels cheap and might irritate a child"
2.0,So cute but when it gets wet it’s completely see through - we can only use this at home unfortunately!!  Wish they’d add lining !
2.0,"My wrists aren't huge, and this band just barely fits. The most annoying part of this problem is that the buckle sits almost all the way on the side of my wrist, rather than on the bottom of my wrist, like every other watch band in history. The stitching on the inside had some very rough edges. I was able to smooth that out with some quick passes over a flame and then using a steel down to smooth out the warmed nylon threads. It does breath well, which was my main reason for buying a nylon band. I ordered the khaki color, but I'm not super excited about the shade. It is darker than in the pictures, more like a faded green. I was hoping for something closer to tan. In the end, it does work, and it was cheap, so i'm using it until I stumble onto something better."
2.0,The band colors that I brought were fine. The wristband was kind of large I think that they should have a way to make different size wristbands for people who have smaller wrists
2.0,"I was hoping they would be just right, but the top is so tight it leaves an indentation on my leg.  I am a 102 lb. woman so were not talking about some one with heavy legs.  I will be sending them back."
2.0,"Really short waisted.  It hits right under the breasts.  I wanted to like this dress, but I really don't.  The material is good.  I'm going to give it to a friend of mine that is expecting."
2.0,Love the pants BUT will have to return. When you click on the size chart it shows kids sizes so I thought I was getting  an XL boys (18-20) but it is an adult! Very frustrating.
2.0,not for tall girl
2.0,One of the rings turned my toe green within a day or two.
2.0,We tested costume when arrived and it seemed to work.  Day of trick or treat..group of friends purchased different colors and went together.  The battery pack came out of shallow pocket while walking and was bumped by knee.  The wires disconnected right at battery pack base…no more glow!  Only 10 minutes into trick or treat.  There is no fixing because wiring is sooo fine and thin.  Super disappointed ☹️
2.0,"This bracelet is already tarnishing and i purchased it on July 9, 2015. For the cost of $24.99 one would think it would hold up at least for a year. HIGHLY disappointed. I really love the look, but wish it lasted. Do not waste your money!"
2.0,I thought this was an earring cuff for the middle of the ear...good quality and fast delivery.
2.0,"Wasn’t fond of the material. It was a shiny material almost like a spandex and the cut of the dress was unflattering as well as uncomfortable. The actual print of the material is cute, though."
2.0,"I bought these for my son as a gift. He loves the way they fit; however, after only one use, playing basketball, the knee ripped. I am very disappointed in this product!"
2.0,This was extremely huge (for a bigger mans face) the ties are held on by glue. Not very sturdy for all night wear. Mine broke within 2 hours. Not really worth buying.
2.0,I didn't like the material but because it was so big even the style looked nothing like the picture.  I was disappointed.
2.0,It doesn’t keep the shirt down.
2.0,Very see through! Weird yoga band with extra material.
2.0,My daughter has worn these shoes twice for water play at school (approx 30 minutes at a time) and all ready she has worn the toes out of the one shoe. Terrible quality.
2.0,Item is larger than it appears
2.0,"I loved it but a piece all of the sudden fell/disappeared and it was impossible to take it off.  After using it a few months, today I had to tear it off. :("
2.0,"I got them to wear with compression stockings, which are slip-prone on smooth surfaces.  .These items, when on carpet,  catch and roll under--helpful on wood and tile .It just depends on your floor type.."
2.0,i don't have time to wrap that super long thing!
2.0,"If your phone has a case on it, it doesn't snap shut. Constantly flies open"
2.0,Too  quiet.
2.0,"Didn't like the fit of these, they were too long and too tight for my likes."
2.0,"Coming apart, less than three months old. Major disappointment. Do not buy."
2.0,"We didn't receive all the masks that are advertised in this listing: no tongue or grimace versions. Buyer beware, as you may not get the mask you wanted."
2.0,"The neck warmer is a nice fleece item. So you know, it is made of an entirely different material than the hat. The pictures of the hat are deceptive. Most show the wearer, whether Caucasian or Asian, with the hat fitting snugly and smoothly. I have a pumpkin head (7-⅞). the top of the hat is far too long . If I were to pull it down so that the crown fits as in the pictures, the bill would be over my mouth. Quack."
2.0,The top is large and not fitted.  The lining for breast coverage was loosely sewn in and moves around alot. The waste line/belt area is the only part of the dress that does not stretch. Poor zipper. Cute dress though.
2.0,The watches are great but there' re fix because there aren't have battery.  I had to buy a new battery for everyone of them. Why I want to use a watch without battery?. You have to be careful with that.
2.0,Runs really small. I wear a 7.5 so I ordered a 8 and it fits like 6.5.
2.0,"Very much like that they are compact, but the glass isn't really too clear"
2.0,"The fit was good. True to size and goo quality material.However,the picture of the design of the matrial was not the same as the one I received. I was disappointed to say the least. It is only reason why I bought the dress in the first place."
2.0,The bodice insert did not fit as appears in the picture.  Was too stiff and straight across the top.
2.0,"This pullover was great; comfortable, soft, and received compliments from classmates. However, after the first wash, the seams came undone. Guess you get what you pay for."
2.0,Super cute but very stiff. The size was perfect expect for the sleeves there is no way I can get my arms in. The whole thing is very scratchy.
2.0,Just got this leather watch and right outta the box the leather was damaged. You think someone selling Michael Kors would pay attention to the details of the watch and not sell a damaged watch. Sigh idk why everything I get that is meant to be nice from amazon comes slightly damaged. Why can’t I have anything that’s worth value to be nice?! WHY WHY WHY?!
2.0,Poor quality. looks really cheap. have to return it
2.0,"Love the product, but it fell apart on first use. It literally fell apart at the seams. Sorry, the product would have been wonderful if it would have help up after one use."
2.0,"This is an awful suit. I typically wear a size small (4), but after reading all of the reviews, I decided to size up to a large since I want to be comfortable and if the top was loose I could still nurse in it without issue. Well even after sizing up TWO sizes, it barely fits. It is extremely tight on the bottoms and the top fits just snugly as well. I like the cut of the top and I was excited to try this suit because it looks vintage and classy. I have kids so I dont want to look inappropriate or trashy. Unfortunately, I am so uncomfortable in this because it just doesnt fit right. If you're going to take a chance on this suit, then please please please size up a couple - especially if you have a big butt or full chest. The seams around the legs cut into me a little - I dont have a big butt or big legs, but I sure felt like it in these bottoms. I woudnt purchase!<br /><br />I received this item for free in exchange for my honest and unbiased review."
2.0,"I'm 6'1 and thin.  Pattyboutik items in medium or large usually fit well and the extra long sleeves are perfect for me. This sweater arrived with a small pull in the neckline and was way, way too tight.  Had to return.  Great color combo though and nice fabric."
2.0,Too stiff . Couldn’t put them on.
2.0,The pants did not fit me well at all. I'm usually a regular small but these pants sit way too high on my ankles and every time I bent I felt as if I was ripping them. They were pretty thin for pajamas
2.0,"Leaks thru the seam in the front! Doesn't do me any good if my shirt still ends up wet! Works fine for very lite leaks, but nothing more than a few drops"
2.0,Very cheap material. Not at all what I was expecting.
2.0,"Allergic reaction to the watch material.<br />The watch band is fragile, and not a sturdy band."
2.0,The liner for the internal pockets tare very easily.  I had to repair them after only a week.
2.0,"Very cute swimsuit. Took a little while to arrive, but that was okay. A little snug but still wearable, and very pretty summer pattern. I did take a couple stars because as cute as the corset-style back is, it's very annoying that I have to take it out every time I put this on or take it off. Also, the bra-like front seems a little small, I kind of have to squish and smash everything to fit in there and as soon as I move, it's all out again. I will probably end up using a different swim suit, especially because my summer plans have changed and I will be swimming for exercise more than leisure. This would be excellent for a smaller woman (I'm 5'10&#34;, about 170 pounds), and someone who doesn't mind sacrifice the extra 5-10 minutes to lace it up/down every time you need to put it on or remove it. However, I have three kids and need those precious minutes to get ready! I did receive this at a discount in exchange for an honest, unbiased review."
2.0,one of the balls came off the post while my daughter was cleaning them.
2.0,This became loose and basically unusable after about a month.
2.0,This runs very very small. I ordered up 2 sizes based on my measurements and everything and it was still really small. It's more of a juniors shirt. It would be fine for someone really thin. The matireal is paper thin and see through. It looks like an iron on transfer not a vinyl applique
2.0,Glitter comes off while wearing...what have I ingested? UGH!
2.0,Received 2 of the greens and 1 more that didn't work. *sigh* no more please
2.0,I wish the legs were wider and the material was a better quality.
2.0,The back pockets hung really low on my tiny butt. I ripped the pockets off and they looked better.
2.0,im worried about wearing it because i feel like the stitching will split
2.0,States its 100% cotton but it is not. The fabric isn't as soft as I thought it'd be.  The color is as pictured and its cute i was just expecting a different fabric.
2.0,"Very thick material and very small for size expected in men's sizes.. long and lean fit. Not for the ""dad bod"""
2.0,Its super cute! More oval then round but easy to put on and def worth the money and they sent me a free septum ring too<br /><br />Edit: this turned green inside my nose so don't buy this
2.0,"Love the lounge set, however, material pilled on first wearing. Washed by package directions, pilled more. Not happy with that."
2.0,"This sweater is cheap and it is not cut right. It hangs funny. I washed it hoping it would shrink but no such luck. It's not only way to large and has no shape whatsoever, but it's also super stretchy and has zero form. It is one of the most unflattering shirts (I would hardly call this piece a sweater) a woman can wear."
2.0,these socks became thread bare with in one usage. We bought 5 pair and they all did the same thing. They are garbage.
2.0,Small. I don't know why they are so short either. I would probably return them but it's just too much work so I'll just wear them under other shirts probably
2.0,"I was not thrilled. It is a very light material. For the price, compared to other NF beenies, it should have been better"
2.0,"I had a hard time getting my hands into these and I'm under 6 ft tall.  Giant?  Not even.  I'd return them, but I don't have enough time."
2.0,This was very small for an adult size. It is tight and uncomfortable.
2.0,"I would not recommend this item.  I bought it for my son and when we received, it was very weak in construction.  He would have worn it on a necklace and I don't believe it would have held up.  It also was cheap looking. I wouldn't recommend this item."
2.0,I just got some old shoes I wanted to clean I used this cleaner never cleaned shoes really ever in my life it cleaned them up but as for like major stains or anything siting for a long time this cleaner will NOT get it out I’ve been scrubbing and nothing it keep yours shoes clean enough but if u actully want to clean them I think I need a stronger brush or a better cleaner
2.0,"These are good quality stitching and from the thighs down are great but the waist is giant. My kid wanted to keep them (and he is a thin kid) but I literally took 6 inches in on the waist. They are still loose on him, but wearable. If your kid is on the husky side I would think the waist would be fine, but since they are cut slim in the leg I would imagine they would not fit from knee to ankle. I'm not quite sure what proportions these were cut to fit!"
2.0,"Curvy girls beware, this is not the sweater for you.  This sweater is of decent quality but its not really a ""loose"" fit.  Its made very straight up n' down and will probably fit ok on someone who was built like a young teenage boy.  For those of us built like real women, we might as well buy a men's-cut shirt as this sweater is tight in the bust, baggy around the waist, tight around the hips.  Not flattering.  Its going back..."
2.0,"I love the way this band fit and felt. However, only 2 months in, and the bar holding the latch to the leather band will not stay on. every other day my watch will fall off my wrist and i will need to screw the latch back in, it never really becoming tight again. this was a waste of money and i am now in the market for a new watch band..."
2.0,"These solve the problem I had with my bike seat being too uncomfortable but at the expense of other things. These are not at all flattering when worn - looks like a giant teal diaper where all the crevices you don’t want to emphasize, emphasized. Also when biking, I had big issues with the legs rolling up on me. By the time I was done with my workout, I might as well been wearing a diaper because they certainly didn’t look like shorts anymore."
2.0,The fabric is very soft but the overall appearance is cheaply made. The pants are long and high waisted. The elastic is way too tight  The satin trim is not smoothly sewn and the color is odd.
2.0,Thought it would be bigger
2.0,Very very disappointing.  Much too small. Gave it to my daughter who wear small. I love the dress but too sort n too tight n it was 3x I think. I normally wear size 14 /xl/ or large depending on the make.
2.0,This dress is very heavy. They built in bra is a very hard plastic and was centered unrealisticly high. It is still a beautiful dress but I ended up returning it and wearing something else.
2.0,"Heavy, Cut but not really what I wanted."
2.0,"The shark is cool, but likely to come off with some use. I literally made better fastener with part of a paperclip and pliers."
2.0,"Not a fan, felt table cloth"
2.0,"I purchased this and had to return it within a couple of days.  The leather band separated from the plastic piece that attaches to the fitbit.  I used the replacement for about a month.  The leather started peeling back mid-month and I fixed using some super-glue.  By the end of the month, it too had broken free.  It looks good and is comfortable, but is not durable."
2.0,Way too large for a small child/infants head even on the tightest setting! Returned this item right away.
2.0,I thought that maybe this piece was going to look wearable<br /> But it's just so cheap looking and fake. I wasn't as satisfied as I thought I would be
2.0,"They’re using poor language calling this a sweatshirt. It’s thinner and nowhere near sweatshirt material. It’s not warm. Sizing is off. Find another jacket, this ain’t it."
2.0,For outings was sexy
2.0,Too small sizes don’t match
2.0,want to change
2.0,I am consistently the same size in Freya and this was too small in the cup.
2.0,Runs small and awkward with how it sits on shoulders
2.0,"This item was supposed to get to me between Dec 23 and Jan 4. It showed up on Jan. 8. The size runs small and it was a Christmas gift for my son. It does not fit, nowhere did it say the company was from China so you don’t know till you pay, which I wouldn’t have had an issue with if I could just return it like most Amazon returns but the store won’t take it back , the company did allow me to return this item but shipping is about $2 less than the friggin item . They don’t pay it. It cost me $27.95 if I want to return a $30 item. It was cute and looked exactly like the photo, I would have loved it if it wasn’t just an ornament now"
2.0,I really wanted to like these but I bought them and couldn’t even get these on my sons feet.
2.0,"Not what expected. Not sweater material at all, it’s a funky material that doesn’t breath. The cut was also strange. Big in some spots and snug in others.  Ended up returning."
2.0,"I'll start by saying that the laces themselves seem like they're high quality.  I've only had them a couple days, so I can't comment on the longevity.  The problem lies in the length and the adjustable aglets.  I first ordered a pair of 44&#34; laces, which ended up being a little over 50&#34;.  I thought &#34;Ok no problem, I'll just cut them shorter and install the little metal aglets.&#34;  But the metal aglets are too thick to fit through the lace holes, meaning you have to lace your shoes/boots, THEN install the aglets.  Additionally, the laces can't be removed unless you want to deal with removing the aglet, then trying to thread the lace back into the small aglet opening without the aid of the preinstalled plastic aglet.  Annoyed, I ordered 40&#34; laces since the 44&#34; pair I ordered first ended up being over 50&#34;.  They arrived, and they're not 40&#34;, they're more like 47&#34;.  They're still a little too long, but I guess I'll just deal with it, because I'm not ordering a third pair.  Overall a pretty frustrating experience."
2.0,"I didn’t like that it was a lot smaller than a large you purchase at the store. After my sister opens it for Christmas, I may have to return for an exchange if they still have it in stock."
2.0,"I'm an in-between person; not super thin but not super large (size 6/8 for reference). This dress fell off me (ordered a medium) and made me feel like a giant tent. If you're fuller-figured and tall (I'm 5'7 so I mean actually tall), this might work great for you. It didn't for me, unfortunately."
2.0,"I could not sleep with this on my head. I tried 3 nights in a row to no avail. I even tried wearing it for an hour before bed, but it was very noticeable when I was actually in bed. On the fourth night, I did manage to fall asleep with it on, but I woke up a couple of hours later and with a slight headache. I also found that I had been drooling profusely, which I never do when I sleep.<br />The velcro straps rustled against my pillow in a bothersome way. I might also mention that I have a large beard and the chin portion slides across my chin unless I have the straps very tight. I believe this may have contributed to the discomfort, but if you are a sensitive sleeper, this might not work for you."
2.0,Quick delivery<br />Quality of the product  was not that great.<br />Bead color was poor and bleed through
2.0,"I ordered grey capris. I got leggings, in the most awful greenish color, like nothing I would ever consider.  They fit well, feel good, but I won't wear them in public..."
2.0,Although clear glass I still feel a pull when wearing. I love the frames.
2.0,it's not a soft feel - poly/lycra or something stretchy.  Probably would have loved it if it had been cotton
2.0,"Meh.  I live the short sleeved looser shirts by the same brand.  These just fit weird...  Too short.  Fits tight on chest, but it’s not fitted all over. Tight in the wrong places.  Kind of thin fabric...I don’t know exactly what I’m saying, or how to describe it, but I put it on and changed after an hour because I didn’t like how it felt or looked.  Maybe this would be good for wearing under sweaters?"
2.0,"Really like the look of these, they are a thicker synthetic. I would have given 4 stars on arrival BUT after one wash and wear a belt loop is coming off and there are multiple areas with fuzzy piling and pulled strings. These are pretty useless as not comfy enough for lounging around and lots of damage. 2 stars if you want to wear once. There are plenty of comfy paper bag pants available on Amazon that are cheap but hold up great, skip these and go with them. 5'1"" 8/10 and the medium was good in length and torso length, I would have preferred a looser waist but they weren't too tight."
2.0,"Barbs are WAY to short, almost looks like it was made for a child’s belly button, luckily the balls are removable so I was able to put them on an old barb I had that’s longer."
2.0,One wash and hung to dry but it still shrunk to half it’s size.
2.0,This shirt was very tight across the chest and pulled into the armpit area.  I am large breasted and ordered a size larger and it was still tight.
2.0,"Read the reviews and got a size up, even I barely squeezed into them and they were too uncomfortable to actually wear for any extended period of time. Unfortunately will be returning."
2.0,Not a fan of how the zipper is placed had a hard time getting my cards in and out
2.0,I don't know any normal woman who could wear this. It is SO tiny. It's nice but useless and not worth the trouble to return. It also took way to long to get it. Very unhappy.
2.0,do not fit anything like the picture
2.0,"not the best, not the worst. wouldn't pay full price, would not buy again. they protect my eyes. but they are small."
2.0,It’s smaller than what a large would typically fit. Fits more like a medium. I do not dry any workout clothes so it’s not that it shrunk in the dryer but just run small in general.
2.0,"Is to small, not the size that I asked. I’m size 10 and that is not even size 6. So disappointed"
2.0,"These look so cute online, but they are made of a bulky knit that feels dry and uncomfortable on my legs.  Kind of scratchy.  The fabric even feels dry to my hands.  They are also too tight - they don't have the give of other compression socks I have.  I never wear them."
2.0,Cute but way smaller than expected.
2.0,I was unaware it only comes with one earring so I was a bit sad that I have to find something to match for the other ear....
2.0,Terrible quality. Material is very thin. Think “Wish”.
2.0,Material is not soft at all.
2.0,turned colors
2.0,I got this because i love swuare necklines and loose shirts but it is fall off the shoulder big in the neck area.<br />otherwise the product itself is a fabulous color in the tan however I would say size down if yall want this to fit like the model!
2.0,"Disliked the fit. Top was unflattering, boxy and loose, but bottom fit snug. Material caused dress to ride up above the knee and I was looking for a below the knee dress specifically. Returning dress because I dont want to pull on it all night."
2.0,"Great oil. It is probably the best fingerboard oil I’ve used for my acoustic guitars to date. I purchased this oil to use on a Larrivee OM-40R that had been sitting at a guitar shop for a few years. The oil immediately soaked into the wood and rehydrated the ebony. The ebony now looks fantastic and has a nice, “soft”luster that gives it a great look. It feels dry to the touch and doesn’t have an oily feel like some lemon oils can leave on your fretboard. It really is a step up from other standard oils and is worth the premium cost.<br /><br />The only reason I rated this as low as I did is because the seller shipped the bottle in a plastic bag. When I received the package, 1/2 of the oil had spilled out inside the bag. I literally tried to pour the spilled oil bag into the bottle, but it didn’t work. Hopefully the seller will remedy this issue so people can actually get their moneys worth of the product."
2.0,not my style ok for the price
2.0,"Fits good. The inside string lasted one wash.. had to pull it all the way through and make a triple knot so it wouldn't do it again, also fit a ittle tight around calves."
2.0,The  magnet is to weak to hold the gem in place.
2.0,Have to return. I ordered the L because everyone said it fits smaller. I'm normally a women's medium. Well this fit way to big. The chest fit fine (I could even snap it shut if I wanted) but the rest was so big it wasn't flattering at all. Returning. I know if I ordered the medium though then the chest area would be to small for me.
2.0,"Nothing plus sized about them - I'm an 18, and they were very tight with a tight waistband, so I'm not sure how a 22/24 could wear them!"
2.0,The design of the bag itself  is great. But the buckle simply does not work. Pull on it in any direction that you please and it will not respond. It just stays locked no matter what I do
2.0,This dress is just okay. It is completely different fabric than the pictures they provide. In the pictures it looks like it is a ribbed cotton but it isn't it is  spandex/polyester. It is a cheap stretchy type of material that shows everything underneath. I am not sure what kind of underwear would be invisible under this because the material is thin and the dress fits tight. I am not sure if this is the case with the other colors but I ordered Army Green. It isn't the worst thing I have ever tried on but it is definitely not great.<br /><br />Disclosure: I received this product for a discounted price for my honest and unbiased review.
2.0,"I bought this dress with high hopes, and it's a no go. I am 5 ft 10in, and the front of the dress is about 4 inches from my lady parts being exposed."
2.0,The earrings were smaller than the picture and the stones had no luster.
2.0,I’ve only had this for 6 months and it’s already falling apart. Very disappointed
2.0,very very thin. Not as pictured at all. Sent back immediately. Color isn't even accurate.
2.0,Not great quality. Too stiff and ribbon doesn’t hold.  Not worth the money. I threw it away and make one on my own.
2.0,"Though cute and inexpensive, took weeks to arrive n tarnished discolored after couple of wears"
2.0,"I guess you get what you pay for, I got this on clearance. It doesn’t hold its shape and it smells a little funky but it is cute and I’ll carry it for awhile"
2.0,This was a nice bag to have for my international trip. Unfortunately the zipper stopped working mid-trip. Totally sucked..
2.0,I love Apple Watch bands but this was disappointed me. The design is so slight and faded you can't see it. The band is hard and digs into my arm while working. Wish I had a better review but I am being honest.
2.0,Very tight... I sized up and still
2.0,"Not as bright as it looks, the color is more pastel."
2.0,Extremely thin material.  Runs small usually a medium is a little to big and its a little to tight. Very pretty otherwise.  Wore it with a black tank top and got many compliments.
2.0,I'm 5ft 8 185 pounds athletic built i wear large got a large but this is very snug and short so unless your slim probably should order a size up or 2.
2.0,Its really tight...it looks the same as the pic just small
2.0,It was not fit for Oakley X Squared sunglasses properly as described. the Temple shocks was a lot more thicker also the Ear socks was longer than the original one.
2.0,Very cheaply made. Several were broken upon delivery.
2.0,"The words at the bottom of the shirt were cut off “Girls, Girls. Girls”. I am waiting for a response from the seller."
2.0,Too wide not long enough
2.0,"Going to return as the size is way off, they claim to be 10-11 but are more like 8-9. The heal of my foot is just hanging of the end. Build seems ok, in particular I like the thin sole compares to so many other that have a very high soul. As this is for indoor use, thinner is better. Time spent dealing wit the return is worth more than the product."
2.0,May corto y El fondo no cubre El tracero
2.0,It's huge! I ordered 1 to 2 years and the tag says 4y to 5y. My 1 yr old will fit it eventually but as for now she still needs a winter coat.
2.0,"I bought these about a year ago but they were getting old and the side was breaking so I thought I’d get a new pair... completely different glasses. Well they’re still heart shaped but they were not as wide, the lenses weren’t the same shade and the sides were different. Don’t like this new pair at all. Returning."
2.0,looks different once received picture looks better than the item
2.0,xl was small
2.0,"The sizes are off, definitely wouldn’t purchase it again."
2.0,the flower is stiff and uncomfortable
2.0,"bigger than expected, boxy"
2.0,"Too tight. My daughter wears a size 1-2 and she couldn't even get her feet into her shoes with these on. Also, they are very difficult for kids to close themselves."
2.0,Great product but I received the wrong size(large). I originally order a small. I gave the bathing suit to my Mom. My Mom loves it.
2.0,Just wasn’t my style . Really nothing wrong with it. Material was soft and fit well and I’m sure it’s cute and other people would like it just not for me.
2.0,Pretty dress but I got a L and it fit like S. The quality is great though.
2.0,Weird fit and seal
2.0,This item doesn't fit for a woman's wrist... went to a jeweler to have it sized and despite remove as many links as possible it was still to large for my wrist.
2.0,"Beautiful color, soft fabric, great price...BUT the shirt and pants are sized REALLY weird!!!  Shirt was somewhat billowy, but pants were super small (way too tight and short.  Like, oddly small.)  The bottoms were actually cut in an irregular fashion, which is exactly what I thought I'd received- irregulars.  Wish they'd worked out, but alas, they were promptly returned.  Oh!  Had an issue with return, too.  Ordered two different colors of this set, and they arrived in the same box.  Set up the same return for both pairs, and sent them back in the box they arrived in, both return slips in the box with them.  Of course, I could only use one of the outside shipping labels.  Come to find out, they don't open the boxes to receive each item.  They simply scan the outer label and put the unopened returned package aside.  Refunded me for only one pair and it took some back and forth on my part to get the refund for the other pair, as they had to locate the box in the warehouse and verify the other pair was returned.  It was refunded, but it was a pain."
2.0,I want for my 8 year boy a chain but he's young so i get this and is to thin the pic. fool you .
2.0,I'd give it more stars but the package said rose red but the item was the orange. Had me looking like inwas ready for halloween
2.0,cheaply plastic made.
2.0,"This is a gift for my future god-daughter, which I am taking to out-of-state in a couple of months; the product/ shoe seemed wide-sized, which I was not expect!"
2.0,More like a flowy shirt than a dress
2.0,Color is way off what the picture shows
2.0,"Low quality. The silver ones came broke, so I can’t even use them."
2.0,"The shirt has some unfinished edges. Due to the fabric type, it may not fray but one sleeve has an uneven cut hanging off the edge. The real problem I have is with the necklace. Due to the price, I was not expecting quality, but this plastic necklace is very chipped and looks used."
2.0,Came with incomplete stitching so the side of the shoe has a hole. Pretty disappointing. Cute from afar but if you get close you can tell these are cheap. The are also pretty narrow. If I wouldn’t have sized up I wouldn’t have been able to get them on.
2.0,All i can say is: looks A LOT better on the picture than when u see it in person :)
2.0,"These are very pretty, and would be great for over a bathing suit, but that's not what I was looking for."
2.0,"The quality of this beret is not what I expected. It is full of bald spots, the thread is sticking out in several places and the stitching is visible on the top. Overall it looks and feels very cheap."
2.0,The quality of the dress is not very good.
2.0,Quality control leaves much to be desired. I put in on my head and it looked crooked. I tried to fix it but i couldnt. Upon inspecting it i noticed the inside padding was bonded to the shell crooked. You would think they would have better quality control for somwthing that its supposed to protect your head.
2.0,"impossible to open, but if you can fight it on it looks nice"
2.0,This is a $20 wedding dress for sure! Don't expect too much. Go 2 sizes up. No good.
2.0,"I got the size my daughter usually wears, and although it fit her, it was a very strange fit. The crotch was too short, has very short legs, and the thighs were tight yet the mid- and upper-section were large. Not flattering in the least!! The material was very strange, like Halloween costume material almost. Definitely not what I expected to get. It does have side pockets and a pocket in the front, and the shoulder straps button in the back, which I found a little strange. It has odd cuffs at the bottom of the legs. This was just a huge no."
2.0,Cute shoe.
2.0,"I am 5’9” and 130. Sized up one size to make sure it was long enough. See my picture...sleeves are WAY too short and balloon out. The shirt is also nowhere near close to as long as the pictured item. Also, awkward fit, tight in armpits, flairs at bottom, hits at the wrong spot. Maybe I got a fluke item, but I am returning and not planning to purchase from this company again."
2.0,"My feet and legs swell in the heat, and I've had a difficult time finding compression socks that (1) fit and (2) are comfortable and not painful.  These socks are still not what I had hoped. Wearing them in hot weather is impossible because of the thickness.  Also, I have large calves, smaller ankles, so I purchase a larger size to fit.  My feet swim in the foot portion with no compression at the ankles.  They are a bad fit for me."
2.0,This mask is was to big to even be able to do what the advertisement shows. Waste of money. Maybe if I use a helmet it would work
2.0,"I ordered a pair of these about 4 years ago and loved them. Ordered another two pair a year later, loved those. And then another two pair this month (01/2021) but the ones I received this time, although still labeled ""Medium"", were baggy and long and seemed to be fluffy in the butt and crotch with extra fabric. Waist fit normally, though.<br /><br />They look stupid and aren't running shorts anymore. Sad to see they've either let Quality Control go, or they've changed the style/cut to be something other than the original running short. Bummer."
2.0,"Poor quality, poor fit. Looks good in picture but not in person."
2.0,"Insanely thin, almost useless. Maybe the filter will provide some worth. My 7 year old daughter was able to blow out a lighter very easily in front of her which is a good test as to how well this will stop anything."
2.0,"Purchased for my daughter's Christmas program.  The fit was fine.  But after 2 hours of standing, she complained her feet hurt and could barely walk.  Returned."
2.0,Cheaply made.  Am returning them.  The seller has been cooperative with that.
2.0,It was tiny! I ordered a L but really it was an USA xtra small
2.0,The price was good but the quality of the hat was poor. The words were uneven and the letter were falling off already.
2.0,"Too tight, had to send back.."
2.0,Got a large because I knew a medium would be small. Even the large is too small for my boobs. I fear the XL won't fit so just returning. Reference im a 38c
2.0,Cute but very stiff. Returned
2.0,"Not sterling silver!!! Amazon needs to remedy this. I can only wear silver or my skin itches and gets a rash. Within minutes of wearing these I started itching. Also, the packaging was horrendous and one of the backs was broken. Do not buy!!'"
2.0,"Nice, but if you have a child like mine that grows like a wild fire then this hat will not be big enough"
2.0,Bought 2 sets one came broken and had to be fixed for wedding.  Runs small bought for skinny 6 and 8 year old and both were almost too small.
2.0,The first time I washed the shirt the Silhouette design started coming off! :(<br />I hope i can exchange it for a new one.
2.0,All four buttons were off when I opened the package. It made me wonder what else might fall apart. Goes over the head. No way to adjust the part that goes behind the head.  I returned it.
2.0,"I got these earrings online, and I was disappointed in them--they were so small, you can hardly see that they're infinity earrings."
2.0,Very poorly made. Returning.
2.0,I loved this necklace. I wore it everyday for about a month and then it broke. I always took it off before bed and never got it wet. The only thing I did that could be remotely harsh was that I put the pearl through the loop twice because it was a little two big. I am very disappointed in this necklace. Throughout the month though I would say it was the best pearl choker I’ve come across.
2.0,Comfortable but seriously only a house dress.  The pockets pucker and are placed on the thighs and the whole dress expands out right there.  Make your hips bigger and the pockets dont lay flat...I just dont like.  Wouldnt even wear to go to the mini mart.
2.0,LEDs could and should have been seated more structurally. Open spaces that affect the visual show
2.0,I got these to help with night driving and they didn’t help at all… pretty disappointing
2.0,not impress as I am with the other skirts
2.0,"The light does NOT backlight the entire screen so you can read the damn thing in the dark.  (which is the whole point of a light up watch).  On this model, the light button is on the top left and there must be a tiny bulb, also only on the top left, so when it is dark, and you press the button, you can ONLY see the first digit of the time.  USELESS."
2.0,"They look great in your hair, you can wear them as regular headbands. However, they barely make a dent in actually sucking up any sweat so they don't really function well for that purpose. They are easy to clean though, you can safely just throw them in the washing machine."
2.0,"I returned, the colors were not like the picture. The shirt was just kind of blah."
2.0,The dress is cute but the fit is weird. I ordered size medium but it was way too big for me. Size down a size or two.
2.0,"Besides taking a really long time to arrive, the masks were somewhat narrow (from top to bottom) and we had difficulty fitting them over the full face of the men for whom I purchased them.  A good novelty item, but without a nose wire and only made from a single layer of thin polyester, the masks were not constructed as well as some others that I've purchased elsewhere."
2.0,"I received this purse yesterday. I was ecstatic! It is bigger than the picture makes it seem which I loved! The color is absolutely perfect red. Everyone at work, my husband, and my children all complemented the bag. I love love love it!!!<br />Ok so update a few weeks later. The seam that holds the zipper to the purse came undone. The zipper is totally detached. I'm so pissed! And they want to make me pay to ship it back.. I'll sew it myself.. I'll never buy another guess purse."
2.0,"Although this scarf which was described as Boucle was quite pretty, it was rather thin and not the  warmer knit Boucle scarf that I thought I was purchasing."
2.0,I got them to see how well they were made. They are  just cheap costume jewelry. I could see your kids liking these earrings when playing dress up. I don't see anyone wearing them out for a night on the town.
2.0,Not very bright - would like to return but past the return date. Have not used for running as I would not be able to see.
2.0,"Unless you have silver dollar NIPPLES no, not areolas this is not going to work for breasts prolly good for another peircing but not the titties."
2.0,"Shirts are beautiful! However, I ordered 3 shirts and only received 2. I wasn't too happy about that considering the long wait for shipping. Overall, I'm disappointed in the seller for not getting my order right and nabbing my money."
2.0,"i had it for about a week before the fake leather started peeling, but the dial still looked nice. surprisingly, it had not gotten scratched the whole half year i wore it. the thing that bothered me though, is the indicator dot at the top came loose about two months after wearing it, and before i got to four months, it came off and was rattling around in the case. about a month after that, the minute hand came loose too, and would rotate as my hand moved. and to put a bow on top, the crown, when pulled to adjust the time, would do nothing to the hour hand. definitely worth a buy. 10/10/500"
2.0,The wire popped out of this top while wearing it for the first time. It does hold the ladies nicely though.
2.0,The post is too high on the earring and the center stone is slightly tinted with a purplish hue.
2.0,Very cute shirt but runs very small. Not a true xxl
2.0,I didn't like the top. The padding is limpy
2.0,I ordered a large and received a 2xl so I'll be returning the item. Plus the quality just does not seem very good at all.
2.0,"Really cute and I loved it,<br /> but the quality is so bad that it barely lasted a week"
2.0,Material cheap looking to me. Fabric is see  through and there were a lot of random threads. It would work as a house dress for chores.
2.0,"Runs very big. Not flattering at all. I’m 115 lbs, 5’4. Definitely not a dress for petite woman"
2.0,"no matter how i tried to wear this headband it was loose material, and the buttons weren't holding my masks in the right area's so it was frustrating wearing it working in the hospital"
2.0,The zipper was broken when it arrived.  There is no way to repair it.
2.0,"Bought these for my daughter's wedding and one of them broke when I was trying them on.  I really loved that these were fairly discrete, but I could still show some nerdiness.  Luckily, I'm pretty skilled with soldering and was able to 'repair' it well enough to wear in the wedding."
2.0,The item broke during first use.  Not made lif good material.
2.0,"Nice bag, but extremely small more for a child than an adult."
2.0,"Shape of bar was hard for me to insert. I had to straighten a bit. the bar is longer than initial piercing one, is hard to get used to & can be seen often. Not sure if I'm going to keep or return yet."
2.0,They slip around and are too too thin. They don't have a grippy patch at he heel so you are always digging around in your shoe which is super unprofessional. Digging around anywhere during a meeting is unprofessional. Don't do it.
2.0,the unnatural material feels uncomfortable and makes me sweat...unlike  cotton pajamas...
2.0,I ordered a brown belt and paid extra to have it arrive in time for a special event. The package arrived on time but the belt inside was Navy Blue! Very different from Brown. It appears I am not the first person this has happened to.
2.0,Absolutely love this shirt and wished it fit. I’m 5’2 120 curvy shape and it looked great on me but the arm pit holes were extremely large: I got a small and it fit like a large.
2.0,The materials of this belt were of reasonable quality but its fabrication was worse than that of the Chinese made junk that I sometimes buy online.  1. there were no protected holes for the buckle tongue to go into and 2. the buckle tongue was too short and it pushed right through the buckle to the other side. 3. the end of the belt would not fit through its leather loop.  Sad that a USA made product is so poorly made.
2.0,Seam ripped the first day worn. Loved them at first till the inner thigh ended up with a huge hole.
2.0,"I wasn't very happy with these earrings. The one broke the moment I put it on, luckily my daughter was able to fixed it. The odd thing about these earrings were that they didn't come with the rubber backs to keep them on.  They were a disappointing purchase and I would not recommend."
2.0,"Pretty, but too hard to read."
2.0,Maybe my son has fat feet. I ordered these a little larger than he needed to accommodate that. His straps rarely stay Velcro closed. They seem very comfy to him but fall off when he walks/runs.
2.0,These are nice and thin to wear under something but definitely NOT compression.
2.0,It started falling apart I have at to glue it back where the glitter part is coming up. So disappointed in this product.
2.0,Qaiulty not great. More like a kitchen apron.
2.0,Neckline is WAY higher than pictured. Not very flattering.
2.0,"Shrunk in washer. I dried them on a drying rack. Did not put in dryer. Also, shipped from China and took forever to get"
2.0,"Aromatic leather.  However, gloves feel too snug."
2.0,"Very cute scarf and hat, but one the first day of wear, one of the fur tassels fell off of the scarf. Hat is also a bit large for my 5 year old, but worked well enough after folding the edge under."
2.0,Not big enough for glass ends
2.0,Pilled on the first wash. But the fit and color were nice.
2.0,They stick to Matt's and carpet not great for a newly walking toddler
2.0,"I loved the look and size of the earrings them selves, however the gauge on the posts were too big. It was actually difficult to try and get them in my ears. Had to return them . A shame too because I really liked the look of them"
2.0,"This is the most uncomfortable thing I've ever worn in my life!  And I own quite a few spandex  undergarments that I can wear under basically anything or while working out.  It runs small number one,  and it is very uncomfortable."
2.0,"Thin, cheap looking product. Probably shouldn't be used for warmth."
2.0,"Online these earrings look larger like for an adult. They are not!  They are too big for a baby, toddler, but good for  a little girl. They are so cheap, I just kept them for a future gift."
2.0,"The earrings are so cute. I bought these for my daughter that keeps losing her earrings so I bought these in hopes she would be able to keep a pair.  This is day 2.... she has already lost one.  I checked morning and night to make sure they were tight and they seemed OK, but not anymore.  One of the backs came off and is now lost."
2.0,I ordered multiple other shorts from other companies and they fit perfectly fine. I ordered these in a 36 as i do with everything and most fit well if not loose. these pants are tight to the point that i cant button them. i would suggest ordering a size up.
2.0,"Before I buy any clothing items off of Amazon I always make sure I read the reviews and from what I saw, people said these leggings were squat proof and non-see-through.  However once I received the leggings they were in fact very see-through to the point that I couldn’t wear them without any oversize shirt covering my backside.  Very disappointed and was really looking forward to these leggings.  If anyone can help me find non-see-through leggings please let me know."
2.0,"Ok, cute little cheap looking but it fits the price"
2.0,"The bracelets were well made, but i didn't care for the look. They just looked a little cheap tp me."
2.0,Bottoms were true to size top too big
2.0,Missing stone when it arrived
2.0,Thin and cheap. Does not have built in sports bra!!soo annoying. Very thin. Not worth it
2.0,"These are beautiful but the hook is very cheap and easily bends and won't latch. Also, the beads are loose with nothing to keep them in place. When I unlatched it for the first time to put them on, half the beads fell off never to be found again and the latch bent so it wouldn't relatch. When I get a chance, I will replace the hooks with a stronger one and fix the problem with the beads so they won't slide."
2.0,"Flats easy, material too soft"
2.0,Poor workmanship.  Not a recommended purchase.  Brand new and pocket seams are fraying after first wash.
2.0,Cute shirt but the material on the front started falling off after one wear.
2.0,Very poor quality. There is extra material where the skirt and the top meet.
2.0,Not long enough reached mid calf of leg
2.0,"It's beautiful, I love this suit so much but sadly will have to return it :(<br />I just received it, I saw a review that said you can't get it wet, so I put it under water and rubbed it (very very gently) and the coolor basically slid or melted right off.<br />If you just like to lay out and not go into water you'll be just fine though."
2.0,Size up a lot. Hopefully a looser fit wont show off everything you got.
2.0,This makes me boobs look extremely misshapen. They come to a point and look ridiculous under ANY shirt I tried. It’s only pleasing to look at from the front.
2.0,Too small and too short could not use for wedding and gave it as a gift to someone else for wedding she could not use it either. Would not buy again.
2.0,"I bought this shirt in the green color and it was a thin sweatshirt material that I loved.  I wanted another color, but the red shirt I received was very different (a t-shirt material and significantly shorter than the green one).  Very disappointed, because I loved the green shirt.  Returned."
2.0,"Very nice belt but after wearing it once, one of the stones fell out😐"
2.0,I didn’t like it. I thought the quality would be better... the material has a funny smell
2.0,"Does not have tight fit, seems stretched out as if worn previously. Pockets hang below bottom of hoodie. Not a shine to it, as in pic, but more matte black."
2.0,nice glasses does shield the glair
2.0,They didn't fit like joggers at the bottom
2.0,"The material is better quality than I expected, which was nice. But the pictures show a dress, whereas this piece is more of a coat that doesn’t close all the way to the floor. There are metal snaps (not hook closures as shown), but they only span the neck to about the top of the waistline, and the rest is open all the way to the ground. This definitely can’t be worn without some type of pants/leggings since it open from the waist down."
2.0,Can't fit my 18 inches neck.  Disappointed
2.0,Material is a little strange. Scratchy and sparkly. I was hoping for more of a full blazer. This is unlined and doesn't fit like I expected. I ironed it for 15 minutes and still looked wrinkled :/
2.0,"bad stitching, terrible form fitting"
2.0,"I loved these so much but they didn't last through much wear. Flimsy and fragile, they broke within a few weeks."
2.0,There is some dirty stuff on it and the pattern on it gradually fades. Cannot find any way to directly conduct the seller.
2.0,"I was big thighs and a big butt, so I usually like pants with leg room...but these pants were SO wide in the legs,Like very awkward and not at all like the model."
2.0,Pretty but way too small and thin.
2.0,"The pattern was cute, the length was good, & material weight is good too. The problem was with the waist which was loose. The bust fit okay but the waist was big & made me appear “square” around the core. Not flattering so I’m returning."
2.0,Way too short I wear it as a shirt there’s no way you could wear it as a dress . 5’2
2.0,"They are just like the pic, but this material bleeds very bad all over my skin and other clothes so It's trash now<br />I didn't send it back because I used it!!"
2.0,too large and didn't like the fabric. It's sheer on the top portion of the dress
2.0,"Overall, I like the vest. However, the workmanship is pretty sloppy. There are a lot of threat ends hanging out everywhere. Those you can carefully cut off. However, there were a couple places where the actual material at the edges started to frazzle."
2.0,So I bought this item 2 years ago and it broke. We've never been able to wear them.  So I finally got around to taking it to a jeweler to repaired.  Because its silver plated with rose gold (and the other I purchased is silver plated in yellow gold) it wouldn't be worth the money I'd spend to fix it.  After soddering the chain to the name it would cost more than I paid to then re-plate it.  Disappointed.
2.0,"I wear these in my ankle booties, and they do not stay on my feet. They just slide off the back of my foot."
2.0,They are not attractive on your feet. Look too wide like flippers. Wasted money. Probably won't wear these. AND the return isn't free.
2.0,"I ordered these, thinking they would be great for some charms that I have printed. I didn't look at the pictures up close, otherwise I wouldn't have purchased these. It seems like the white paint is splattered on randomly and I probably won't use them on any accessory to sell. They jingle great and looks great from afar, but that's about it."
2.0,Daughter wore these like 5-10 times and the strap broke........CHEAP!!!!!
2.0,"Love the size and how lightweight this backpack is, however the zipper on the main pocket broke immediately. So bummed since this is exactly what I wanted....just completely useless."
2.0,"Seems to be made of good quality BUT the milkman wording is sooooo off center. Will return and try order once more, but if the problem is corrected I’ll buy elsewhere."
2.0,Loved it but way too big. Gave it to my aunt
2.0,"Not only do the gloves feel weird on your finger tips because they do not fit right, but my husband WAS able to cut through it while at work. Thank goodness he wasn't hurt."
2.0,The socks are as marketed. The word please is spelled incorrectly and we didn’t notice until I gifted them. We looked back on our order and realized it was spelled wrong in the marketing photo as well.
2.0,This purse is vertical off white. I was expecting it to be white.
2.0,"These apparently run small. They do stretch but if your shoe size is closer to 6, order up a size."
2.0,it’s hard to get the sizing right
2.0,"These are much bigger than I expected. They are pretty, just not my style."
2.0,"My toddler has a squawking sandal her grandmother got for her, and which she loves so much.  So, I decided to get this for after-summer shoes.  The sound it makes is SO loud that scares my toddler as well as annoy people around her.  The shoe comes way bigger than the other shoes with the same size."
2.0,The material is spandexy. It snags a lot. If I'm lucky I'll get 4 wears out of it before I have to trash it. It's really cute on. I paired it with a thick navy belt.
2.0,they dont stretch they have no room for movement feel like im wearing cardboard im sending back asap
2.0,I’m definitely alert missing stones out of my K and makes me want to put it in the trash. Too expensive to be missing stones.
2.0,It may not work with all brands of automatic wrest watches. It did not work with few brands that I have.  It started to make a noticeable whining noise after few weeks of use.
2.0,"These have adjustable arms so that they supposedly fit any size head.  But - even extended all the way they don't even come close to fitting either my wife's head or mine.  Both of our heads are bigger than average, but not so big that we have trouble wearing regular glasses or buying hats off the rack.  These are apparently sized for kids, probably for junior high science class if not elementary school.  Given two stars not one because for all I know they work great for kids..."
2.0,I returned these.  They were very nice I just didn't want piercing studs.
2.0,"The earrings are ok but they are definitely not red, white, and blue. They are pink, white and blue"
2.0,really cheap material. okay for halloween costume.
2.0,Nice but the leg cuffs are too tight.
2.0,"Though the print was adorable, I was unimpressed with this dress. I'm 5'2 and normally wear a large so thats what I purchased. It fit comfortably but has the sack look and is unfortunately unflattering on my curvy body. The sleeves have elastic which look weird on. Also if I lift my arms at all it slips off my shoulders so I was constantly pulling it down. I ended up returning it."
2.0,This dress would have been perfect if the material was a bit thicker. You could see everything through it and I wouldn’t be able to wear it in public so I had to return it. Otherwise the fit and everything was good.
2.0,"This necklace is not as described.  The description says 18 - 38&#34; long but, in fact, it is 18&#34; long.  There is no way to make it longer because the string is knotted every few inches.  If you are looking for a short necklace, this could work.  The stones are much more green in person than they are online (where they look more blue on my monitor)."
2.0,These earring are very long.  Too long for my taste but they are pretty.
2.0,Asian sizes I believe. Way to small
2.0,GRANDSON ONLY HAD THIS FOR TWO WEEKS WHEN THE BAND BROKE
2.0,"I ordered the wine color, and it did not look like the picture. The fabric felt like a polyester table cloth. The only redeeming qualities are the length and the fit. I am 5'5, so the medium was the perfect length. I am thoroughly disappointed in overall quality."
2.0,"Second cover up I bought and again the length is for a tiny person doesn't even cover what I wanted it to cover since it barely goes past my waist, gave to my petite 14 year old daughter . Not as silky as it appeared online."
2.0,Way too small even thought I ordered a size larger so they've been returned--they also didn't stretch at all.
2.0,The top is to small had to really work to get Bills in.
2.0,"Cheap fabric, bad fit, poor construction. Even with my low expectations, it was not worth the price. Its better to by cheap things at Walmart or Target - at least you know what you are paying for."
2.0,This shirt was like a long sleeve t-shirt.  Not sweatshirt material at all.  Runs very small in fit.
2.0,"Unfortunately one of the 6 is way smaller than the others.  It is marked a medium but it is not the same size and has no give to it.  Otherwise, the other 5 are the same size.  My girlfriend ordered these and feels that they are well made and the material is nice and smooth.  They run small for a medium, so if close to the next size up, recommend the next size.  The package is odd too, as they are marked as hiphuggers but are thongs."
2.0,"Made of cheap shiny material.. I normally wear a small, unless I want a really loose look.  I ordered medium and it fit like a size 0.  Returned it"
2.0,The good news is you get two bracelets.  The bad news is the quality still isn't worth the price.  I returned them with no hassle.
2.0,[[VIDEOID:156a4b8956f1e3c7559375c7d166c238]]
2.0,"This skirt is not at all flattering if you're ""hippy"". I'm hourglass shaped and hoped it would work, but it has so much flare that it makes me look HUGE! I normally wear medium and got medium, and felt like I could have gone down a size otr TWO because of the flare."
2.0,The left foot was made backwards asked for replacement we will see how it comes
2.0,Cheap cheap quality. Not at all built for large chested women. Ripped easily when putting on.
2.0,"The brand is misrepresented. The brand name is actually &#34;Denise&#34;. If I had known this information, I would not have ordered these scrubs as I have bought them previously and been very unhappy. According to the size chart I am a 2x, which I thought was strange since I am usually a large, occasionally an xl. But I saw previous reviews that the scrubs ran small so I went ahead and ordered the 2x. For reference, I am 5'3&#34;, I wear a size 12 in street clothes, but I am very busty (38ff). The 2x fit me like a clown suit. Also, they are described as &#34;Ultra Soft&#34;... but nothing could be further from the truth. The material is thin, stiff and has a scratchy feel against the skin. There were several loose threads at the seams and the material is prone to pilling after only a few washes. You can get better scrubs for $7 a piece at Walmart."
2.0,I thought the sea glass would be bigger
2.0,Got a size medium and it was an extra small fit at best.
2.0,The product arrived in used condition not new. It was clearly touched up with paint and the paint was poorly applied and in the wrong areas. I was hoping these gloves would be great as I need a new pair but these heavily disappointed.
2.0,Adorable shirt but fit is way too small. Had to send it back!
2.0,it broke after wearing it five times
2.0,Fabric was printed and cheap.
2.0,"Really weird that the tags are all on the outside of the shorts.  Shorts are black and tags are white, so very obvious. Returning since I don't want to risk cutting them off and cutting the shorts."
2.0,I purchased these earrings before but lost the repair. This recent purchase was to replace the lost pair. What I received was nothing like the previous pair. The colors were nothing like the previous pair or the pair advertised on Amazon. They also did not hang properly. I returned them.
2.0,These are very pretty but made with real cheap materials. I wore them 3 times and the post snapped off.
2.0,I bought this bag for a wedding but when it came its too small but look OK so I have to go an get me another.
2.0,The sapphires are very dark. They look black. I am disappointing that they do not look blue like they do in the picture.
2.0,I ordered two pairs of these jeans. I sent one back. One pair a small the leg portion kept riding up on my legs. The waist felt weird.<br /><br />I ordered a medium and it had the same weird feel. I sent back immediately.<br /><br />I would not recommend buying these jeans although they are pretty. The fit is not comfortable.<br /><br />I’m giving my other pair away as the time has passed to send these back. A waste of good money.
2.0,"Weird fabric, does not look good on"
2.0,The tassels aren't secure at the bottom.. they're weaved into the seam and come out easily.. it looks like the picture though..
2.0,Doesn’t fit true to size or length
2.0,Pretty at a glance but very gaudy.<br />I bought to wear for my wedding and there was no way I would.<br />It came with dangling jewel unattached so it was defective like many other reviews noted.<br />Looks too much like kiddie jewelry- poor quality!
2.0,"The bag is cute but it was made for younger children. The display picture is deceiving. It looked like a medium size backpack, but once you buy it, it’s actually way too small."
2.0,"Beautiful, but very heavy and too long for me"
2.0,It's overpriced for the quality of the materials used.  Cut the price in half then I would give it four stars.
2.0,"These were the wrong size for me.  I found the size chart confusing and not precise.  I sent them back. I love the concept, and have had other LED shoes, but these didn't work for me."
2.0,"Two stars, one for having the holster, another for being a (cheap, tacky) white belt. The buckle is molded, just the front is present, with flimsy metal. There is mild rigidity to the belt buckle, I hope it doesn't crumple when my son wears it for Halloween. Weirdly, fashion jeans, is imprinted on the buckle. It is wildly over priced for what you get. I paid right around $16.00 for this, like a numbskull. Do better then I did. Read the reviews and walk away. It really is a bad as the other reviews say."
2.0,I din like the product quality
2.0,Unusually large and heavy. They touch my shouldets. They will not hang right on the ear and tend to show the back. I gave them away as a gift.
2.0,The size of the clothes wasn't the problem. The length of the pant legs was the problem I don't know ANY 7' women. And this is not an outfit that would go well with heels.
2.0,"It’s a cute mask, but it’s just super thin! Not worth $10 for ONE super thin mask. Mask is a little too big for my face as well, leaving open gaps on the sides. So on top of the mask being thin, the open spaces on the side of the mask makes me more paranoid with wearing this. If you buy, be prepared to double up in order to feel more secure."
2.0,"I LOVE these earrings.  Why just 2 stars?  One pair was perfect.  2nd. pair was defective.  I sent a letter but I haven't heard a response yet.  If the seller makes this purchase right---I'll give it a 5 star--so far, just 2.  (They are very petite--but very pretty.)"
2.0,"The product description shows the fabric is that thinner, heathered fabric….it’s not. It’s pretty thick and opaque….toilet bowl white lolol."
2.0,"it was cute, but didn't fit right. Not the size that the size chart said it was."
2.0,"Fits great but has a very awkward pleat on the stomach, which makes me look like I'm pregnant.....and I'm not pregnant."
2.0,I ordered a medium. I’m normally a size 8/10 bottoms. These are extremely large for a size medium. I believe these are plus size women clothing.
2.0,"Doesn't look like the picture, the off the shoulder part of the dress isn't a relaxed fit. I'm 5'5 and it doesn't even come close to floor length. I just altogether don't really like it. I was really excited to receive it. Very disappointing."
2.0,"I love the texture of the fabric of this sweater, but it fit so awkwardly, I had to return it. The pockets bulge out and make your hips look huge. The sleeves are way too short, even on someone with short arms to begin with. And the cuff shown on the model is sewn in that way, you can't un-cuff them to make it longer. I wear a medium in everything, so that's what I ordered this in, and it was just weird."
2.0,"Love the color.  Maybe I should have ordered a larger size.  To thin also.  Quality, nahh!!"
2.0,This is just OK. It’s definitely not the sweater you see on the model. Colors aren’t even the same ...but it’s still cute and not expensive so I will keep it. The worst part is the completely cheap and tacky red button on it. They could have just used a plain black button instead of the weird red one that I will need to replace before I wear it
2.0,Just what I wanted.  The fit and colors are great.  I have 2 white ones.  The one I wore 1 time and washed it and the strap broke.  The other white one I didn't wash it and put it on and boom strap broke.  Very odd it was both the white.
2.0,"First, my daughter wears a 13 or 1, so when I ordered the 1/2, I expected there to be a little room to grow. Her toes are all the way at the ends, so I guess they won't fit as long as I hoped. Second, after only two days of wear, the outsides already came loose...on both feet! When paying over $20 for children's slippers, I expected them to hold up a little longer than these! Very disappointing!"
2.0,"I bought a size up based on reviews and it fit dry well. Cute dress and a good length. However, the fabric is really stiff and coarse. Wasn't very comfortable 😔"
2.0,"These ran super small. They indicated they ran small, but they were at least 2, probably 3 sizes small."
2.0,Thin material that doesn’t stretch well. Worn them twice and they started to fray at the seems.
2.0,"fits VERY loose around the neck, bulges out, was a disappointment to me!"
2.0,"If you are using these for looking at gemstones where you would normally use a handheld loupe this will work well for you. But do not expect to be able to do any sort of work on anything with it.  And you can't use both eyes at one time. I bought it for use on watch repair projects and it is almost entirely useless. The focal point of each lense is about 1.5&#34; to 2&#34; in front of each lense. So you have to bring each object right up to it to see it. For me the watch movements were then so close that I couldn't see it the parts from the side or they hit the magnifier lights damaging the sensitive parts. I also couldn't see the screws and put a screw driver in there to un/rescrew then because they were just too close and the screwdriver would hit it. So this is useless for doing jewelry work, watches, setting stones, etc. all it is good for is looking at things you can bring to your eye like gemstones, stamps, coins etc. I will be sending these back for sure."
2.0,Color of the hat was a lot lighter than the picture - what I received is more in the beige tones. Because it's so light the stitched logo blends right into the hat and difficult to see. Another deal breaker was that the inside of the hat is white which is gonna be difficult to keep clean. Quality is good.
2.0,The stones fall off right away only for show !
2.0,"Not as nice as hoot, gems are not as dense.  Looks cheap"
2.0,"I ordered this for my granddaughter, she normally wears 4T-5T, however, this outfit might fit her when she is 8 or 9, it was huge.  She liked the shirt so much that I had to sew the seams in to fit her.  I put the shorts aside to see if they fit in about 3 years."
2.0,I dislike that the picture has a skinny leg and the pants i got are wider....
2.0,"Shirt is super cute and fits good, but goes too low around the boobs and shows your bra completely!"
2.0,It was OK . The description was a little off. The measurement is end to end . The dangle is about 12&#34; without the same detail of the main chain. Would not recommend if your over a size 12. Packaging  was less than fair.
2.0,I loved the style and pattern on this suit but the top cut way too low under the arm pits and chest to make it work at all. If the cut of the top was higher I would definitely have kept it but I sadly had to return it.
2.0,Ordered but didn't include belt. Called Customer Service and they weren't able to send it out separately. No more available in my size so I'll have to return with no resolution (going skiing at the end of the month).<br /><br />Sad<br /><br />BTW I ordered an extra size up base on reviews. Pretty baggy but waste and hips are good. Would have been to tight around my mid section if I didn't order a size up.
2.0,Feel apart after one wear.
2.0,After about a month one of the clips stopped grabbing the shirt so now I'm one legged on one side.  Other than that it's fine
2.0,I don't like the way it fits in the waistline.
2.0,It’s a little gocky
2.0,"I am very disappointed with this shirt. I have several UA shirts and have been wearing UA shirts for several years, this shirt is not one of them."
2.0,"These are nice tank tops they are soft, but definitely not compression. I ordered a size down and they were still a little baggie."
2.0,Runs sooooo so small. Cheap fabric. Never got to wear. Bottom size was significantly smaller than top size although I ordered same size in both.
2.0,"very thin, see through and LOW cut. Looks like PJ's not a dress."
2.0,Pretty. but the diamond fell out in a week later
2.0,Pretty but looks more like a piece of plastic then a stone.
2.0,The baby bear doesn't look as well as it does in the product photos.
2.0,"I don’t like how it fit, wider than I expected (and I have a “big” head), is not flexible and you don’t feel comfortable using it."
2.0,The upper arms was too small.
2.0,I just received this bead three weeks ago and the &#34;dog mom&#34; and the paw prints are already a copper color. No matter what I clean it with it only gets worse. I'm really disappointed.
2.0,"I purchased this dress thinking it would be a nice summer dress.  Boy was I wrong.  When I tried it on I looked like my chest had grown four sizes and I had turned into a 14 year old baby doll. The empire location is not flattering and the skirt poofs out more than the picture shows.  Unless you have an A cup chest this dress is not for you.  The top was very tight.  For reference I am 5'7"" 34C and normally wear a size 2-4/Small.  The Medium in this dress was too small."
2.0,"I really wanted to love this set because it seemed like a good value for the price but in the end it just wasnt worth it. I'll start by saying the bras are nice, they are padded and look cute. Unfortunately the bottoms were more of a legging material so there was no compression on the top half, I felt like if I worked out in them they would of just kept sliding down but if I had ordered a size medium I doubt they would of felt comfortable anywhere else."
2.0,"You get what you pay for. Love the color and idea of this, but the zippers stopped working after using it for a few weeks. Also WAY too small for even my basic stuff. Would not buy again."
2.0,"VERY cute earrings, but don't appear to be hypoallergenic as I had a severe allergic reaction and had to throw them out. Loved how they looked, but simply couldn't wear them."
2.0,"If you really need a new strap and you somehow broke the connecting ends, this is an okay replacement. If your connecting ends are fine, look for replacement straps and skip this. This band is like a case with straps so the Gear Fit 2 goes inside of it. My main problem is that the band blocks some of the screen and I have to move it around and readjust it every time I wanted to use the watch. The strap is okay, but the &#34;buckle&#34; has come undone a couple of times and doesn't feel good. I wouldn't recommend this unless you have broken your watch and the original straps can't connect anymore."
2.0,earings are small. Cheaply made for the price.
2.0,"I was looking at other bags but the pineapple keychain was what made me buy this one but when I received it, it didn't come with the keychain which was rather disappointing."
2.0,Very nice grey color but run very large and baggy.
2.0,Size 9-10 fits more like 11-12- would order one size down
2.0,"Beautiful, but not as pictured. I can't see the pink crystals...do you?<br />I was thinking to order again...maybe they have two models, but there is no guarantee I'll receive the one they advertise. I also ordered the koala with baby charm, and I have the same problem...no pink crystals.<br />I'll keep them, because are beautiful, but I'm a little disappointed."
2.0,"Painful to wear, sized for children, scratched lens with first cleaning.  Threw them away.."
2.0,"These aren’t my favorite, It doesn’t have a panty liner. Also pockets are important and only has one."
2.0,They are not bad looking but they are not very comfortable. Its basically worse than walking barefooted. I do not recommend.
2.0,"Im happy I ordered this dress a month early otherwise I would have gone to my friends wedding with these gross stains all over the right shoulder! It straight up looks like a guys um...well.... let's just say someone had to much fun while still wearing this dress. It's super disappointing too, it's a really cute dress :("
2.0,"According to their size chart, a XX-large would fit my chest with room to spare. It is comically small on me!! And they suggest going down a size!!!! what a joke. It has pockets and the material is soft, but not worth the approx 38 dollar price tag."
2.0,"This dress is nothing to brag about. Sure, it’s comfortable, but it’s not flattering at all. I ordered a small, I’m thin with a flat stomach and it still makes me look like I have pooch. It’s fine for church or work- again, nothing special. But it’s comfortable. Definitely not worth the price."
2.0,Shirt fits really small and I got a 2x pants to big
2.0,"It has a good skeleton graphic and the hood/mask is cute, but this didn’t fit at all. Followed the size chart for 5’-4” and ordered a small. The zipper ends around my crotch and the actual crotch of the onesie hits mid-thigh. Very uncomfortable. Description says 10% cotton, but it’s 100% polyester. Disappointed!"
2.0,I love the look of the watch it is beautiful.  Sadly it didn't work.
2.0,I'm so disappointed in this dress. It fits wonderful but it is completely see through. I feel like it is only good for a swim suit cover up.
2.0,"I went back and forth on these for a long time only because the reviews were split about whether or not to order a size up or down or true size. So after a year I finally took the plunge and ordered an 8, which is my true size.<br /><br />Unfortunately, they definitely ran big (and I have wide feet so thought they might even be small), but that wasn't even the problem. I figured if I got the wrong size I'd just exchange them. But I wouldn't dare do that after seeing them in person. They were  cheaply put together and seemed used.<br /><br />There were scuffs even though they came wrapped up in little baggies. And the box looked like it had been through a journey and the shoes looked even worse.<br /><br />The back where the zipper was had markings from where they were to sew the strap, and it was also a different color from the rest of the satin on the shoe - kinda tan, like a fleshy color. I included a photo that shows the front and back so you can see the difference. I also included a photo that shows how much room there was and how big the strap is.<br /><br />These were supposed to be white and I wanted to wear them for my wedding but I couldn't overlook these flaws. I think if I had gotten them in black or pink or any dark color the markings and discoloration wouldn't have been so apparent, but with white shoes they should pay more attention to details.<br /><br />The strap was definitely too big as well, which I was expecting due to other reviews.<br /><br />Wasn't happy with these at all, but added an extra star because they were easy to return."
2.0,"I do like the sweater - it feels great and I am comfortable in it.  The sleeves are a bit short as noted in some other reviews but work for me.  What upset me is that I ordered the gorgeous color noted on the order choices with navy, white, pink, tan but got tan, white and grey.  NOT what I wanted.  Very disappointed with this.  Will be contacting company to request proper sweater color."
2.0,Should have stuck with the ZULU bands I have been getting from another supplier. The band I received was flimsy and the holes for the band started about 1 1/2&#34; farther down the band. Hope the one I ordered 2 weeks ago from the same people does not have similar problems! Not recommended unless you have an unusually large wrist.
2.0,The model must be wearing an XXL because in no way does it fit that way. The material is not harsh but it isn't soft either its very strange feeling.
2.0,Too small even as 5X.
2.0,The material is very soft and light not what I expected.
2.0,"These are great gloves..very comfy. Bought them last year and came back to buy again this year. Unfortunately, the touch screen fingers do not work this year."
2.0,"One of the boobs was sewn upside down, I am extremely disappointed. I really liked the material and when I tried it on in the only way i managed too it fit really well. The bottom part is a little too big. I live overseas and wish I could trade it for a top that was actually sewn correctly.."
2.0,Was disappointed in the product. Not what I apected
2.0,...as ing shorter than my tennis skirt!
2.0,I work 12 hour shifts and walk an average of 6 miles a day at work. I’m wearing these for the first time today and I’ll say I’m not impressed! They keep slipping down. I’m 6 feet tall so they don’t come up high enough. They do fit my wide calf (20 inch) fine but I wouldn’t buy these if your taller than maybe 5’7”. Otherwise they won’t reach your knee and will fall down. They are cute but I won’t wear them again!
2.0,"Cute look, very soft, but the string is garbage and will not stand up to toddler use. Baby tugged it a bit, then walked around the house dragging the mitten for a couple minutes, and the string split then immediately both ends frayed all the way up. She hadn't even worn, this all happened in minutes. If you just want cute mittens, these seem good. If you want them on a string to prevent loss since kids don't keep their mittens on, don't buy these."
2.0,This item runs very small. I had to order 2 sizes up
2.0,"I really wanted to love this dress because of the cut and I loved this pattern. I am 5’2  155 pounds with a very large bust so I ordered a large. Even though this dress is not expensive, the fabric is very low-quality. I washed it upon receiving it, and this is what it looks like. I feel that I cannot even wear this out of the house now. Very disappointed, it has potential to be a great dress"
2.0,"I like that the pants are light weight and stylish but the sizing is just way off.  I ordered size L and the waist measures 36"" and hip measures 46"".  The lining inside is also longer than the outside so unless you are willing to do some alteration otherwise pass this.  Seller however, is very responding and that's why I am giving it 3 stars."
2.0,"I have purchased this style of Russel Sweatshirt for many years; medium and in black.  The product is now manufactured in different countries around the world i.e., Thailand, Guatemala, etc...  You never know which country.  I have purchased the product three times through Amazon ( two sweatshirts x three purchases) and the medium sweatshirts have varied in size between countries of manufacturing origin.  One purchase was for two sweatshirts that fit well and the other two purchases were sweatshirts that were over sized; all were ordered in black fabric and medium sized.<br /><br />One also must be careful because the ratio of cotton-to-polyester is also variable i.e., 50 cotton/50 polyester vs 20% cotton/80% polyester depending on country of origin.  That ratio is significant in terms of the feel of the fabric.<br /><br />Given the size and fabric inconsistencies I can not recommend purchasing this product on-line.  You are better of going to your local Sporting Goods Store and trying one on before buying.  It's a burden taking the time to return a shipped item and then following up to be sure your account has been credited."
2.0,I have bought a 4 pack in the past and they were perfect. This 4 pack however was made wrong. The straps were sewed on backwards. Which makes it super awkward to wear and not mention it is super itchy bc the the straps are poorly made. I'm really disappointed bc the first set I got I love.
2.0,Están muy lindas pero desnarigado pequeñas no me le sirvieron a mis nietos
2.0,Very soft but strings inside catch your toes as you are attempting to slide them on your feet.
2.0,Order way bigger than what you normally wear
2.0,"Good quality belt, but when my son tried to put it on the end kept falling off. It was too difficult for him so I am returning them."
2.0,"This Creative Ventures The Key to Happiness Sparkling Key Pendant, is made of plastic, and covered in a metallic coating. Very low quality."
2.0,I purchased 2 mm necklaces I got 1 mm necklaces it may not even be a millimeter guarantee they will break within a couple days they’re so thin. Plus it did not come with the invoice nor a return slip. Not happy.
2.0,"Product was stuck together had to peel it apart , which left deformed portions . The jaw moves with some help of some chin padding. Ok for the money , better packaging would help ."
2.0,"I wanted a crossbody bag that I could fit my kindle paperwhite and phone in. They fit...but...the material is somewhat thin...when you fill one zipper compartment, the rest don't have much room....and the zippers are hard to close. They are good zippers but the material is flimsy enough that it takes two hands to do it. Would not recommend"
2.0,"Much smaller than I expected, had to return"
2.0,"The description says a 2pk of bracelets but only 1 arrived, twice. The listing is not correct and misleading."
2.0,"The product is cheap, but I figured it was from the reviews. The tail ripped the first use and the top has gaps and breasts are easily visible. My daughter knew she would not be wearing the 2 piece out, however it should have fit better. We have sown the tail to be able to use it again and the metallic scales rub off. This is gimmicky and works once or twice, don't expect much more out of it."
2.0,The body glue is all dried up and leaves chunks on you.  I think this is old or not stored properly.
2.0,"Check the sizing chart, it is not true to size.  I had to return the belt."
2.0,"Very low quality, didn’t do anything for me"
2.0,I really love the dress very much would love to exchange it for a smaller size it's too big. Please advise would like to return and exchange.
2.0,The medium size bag zipper broke and the large size bag's wheel tore off... not impressed. The little one is great though.
2.0,I<br />AM a typical 18-20 dress size. Wear a 1-2X in maxi dresses so I ordered the 2X. It fit ok. The top was pretty tight<br />When I tried it on without a bra (wasn’t planning to wear it that way just anxious to try it it). The bottom was flowy but was clingy in certain spots (hip area). I<br />Might have kept it anyway (husband said it looked good) except for when I put on a strapless bra I realized how THIN it was!! The top woulda needed an undershirt/cami and then noticed I could see underwear under so woulda had to wear a slip too. Bought for outdoor grad so that wasn’t going to work. Just going to return. Love the dress. Just wish it woulda been a little thicker!
2.0,He has worne these a total of 3 times and the toes have holes in them. Not made well.
2.0,"Not only did they not fit, I didn't like the egg like shape in the front and they come up too hig on my foot, I like my flats a little lower cut."
2.0,The item was nice and fit well until i washed it... Now it’s too small and it looks like it has been washed 100 times... A waste of money unless you plan on never washing it.
2.0,"The fit is smaller than the actual fit. That means it is not true to size.<br />I got my thumb and pinky toes on my left foot bruised and cracked only after playing 30 minutes of game.<br />The seller was ok but this version of Predator is not as good as previous versions.<br />Now I'm stuck with this $170+ of junk and I don't know what to do with it...<br />Wake up, Adidas!!!!!"
2.0,Build quality is really cheap.
2.0,I wanted something a little more satin looking. These were plain and dull. I returned them and found some cheaper at our local halloween store.
2.0,"Super cut, but way to short. If you have a butt please keep looking or wear shorts underneath."
2.0,It’s true sleeves ripped off on the first wear!!
2.0,Shirt runs small.  If you are considering this shirt make sure you buy a size bigger than your normal size.
2.0,"I like that these had two pockets. However, the first ones I ordered had a hole, or broken pocket on the right side. The seller sent another one and it has a broken pocket on the left side. I'm going to try to contact the seller again."
2.0,They look classy but the pilled after 2 wears.
2.0,It looks super cheap
2.0,VERY POOR QUALITY CLASP!
2.0,Way too large. I will have to take it in. Buy two sizes smaller than usual.
2.0,Too large for pocket
2.0,This sweater looks so cute on the model but it ran extremely small. Disappointed that I had to send it back
2.0,Quite a few flaws throughout the resin.
2.0,"Overall the design is cute. However, you can't see in the pictures but the shoulders have these &#34;shoulder pad&#34; looking fabric that are hideous. The fabric sticks straight up from the shoulder.  The fabric is very cheap to the touch. It is a very 50's dress."
2.0,"I have an eye condition that makes driving at night difficult,  and I was hoping these goggles would help.  They make a small difference if any. Plus they are huge and unattractive"
2.0,"The embroidery is extremely itchy, which makes this very uncomfortable."
2.0,too small couldn't get it zipped :(
2.0,"The ring is beautiful, heavy and comfortable. Unfortunately, it came apart after three days of wearing. I would love to purchase another, and likely will at some point but I hope that the next does not break down so quickly."
2.0,Returned. Too small and caused my pinky toe to chafe and blister.
2.0,The material was perfect and it actually fit almost perfectly with the exception that my midriff was a little tight which was no problem. My problem was the fact that the off the off the shoulder was not as long in person as advertised. It was very disappointing. I ended up having to return the product. If it was as pictured In would have kept It
2.0,They just don’t stay up at all. I have never worn one out of the house.
2.0,Very cute. Very small. The pin does not close snuggly or securely. The spring closure does not “spring” at all. It is very loose and could easily open and the brooch fall off. Not what I expected for $40 and the Solvar brand.
2.0,"The picture is misleading. It is nowhere near as fitted as it appears. It is boxy, bulky and if you have a nice waist, you can forget about showing it off in this thing. I am a tall woman with toned hourglass curves, so I ordered a large but when I tried it on, I thought I accidentally ordered the extra large. Also took way too long to be delivered for such a disappointment.<br /><br />It is warm & cozy and the color block aesthetic are the only 2 things redeemable about this hoodie, but this will be a let down for very feminine women who do not like to drown their figures in bulky shapes."
2.0,The string was WAY too short and it doesn't have a clasp to open it.
2.0,"First of, the shirt is not very long as it looks in the pic. The cut is weird but the pic is cute, and that is the only reason I would war this shirt."
2.0,"I was expecting a more durable product, but I don’t think these would last two sessions at the gym. The material is incredibly thin and cheap."
2.0,this shirt is SMALL and runs small and I ordered a large
2.0,"I measured my daughters foot, and based on the graph included in the ad, she should wear a “25”, which was equivalent to her US size (10 toddler). We got the “25” which says US 8.5 on the box!!!!!! WAY too small. I’m completely annoyed, because the size up is twice the price 👎🏻<br />I actually own an adult pair of hot chocolates and LOVE THEM, but why spend $50 on shoes that won’t fit for very long??? (And will get destroyed anyway). Bummed!!!"
2.0,"2 pairs came broken, however, i’m not sure that’s bad for how cheep they were."
2.0,"Although very comfortable, these shoes are terrible quality. Material on top of straps has already been peeling off and they’ve hardly been worn for a week"
2.0,I thought this was a dress. Trying on this outfit on I had to squeeze in the skirt. Once it got it pass my hips and butt it fit too big. I will be returning it.
2.0,"These shoes run very small.  I wear a 9, but ordered a 10 to ensure my heel wouldn't hang over the back.  But still the shoe was very small.  I like the color combination, but the overall quality of the material is very poor.  I would had returned the shoe, but found someone to give it to instead."
2.0,"Good watch, but I believe the leather band is really plastic or synthetic and it does not flex to my wrist well.  . I have to continually move the watch to the front of my wrist."
2.0,I've been afraid to wear this belt truthfully . It smells horrid like that &#34;new set of Goodyear tires&#34; rubber smell . It's been sitting on my coat rack and every time I walk by it I smell it's pungent stench . I don't want that on me .
2.0,The bracelets were so beautiful but they broke within a week of wearing :( sad I spent money on these to break so quickly
2.0,This skirt would have been so cute if it was better quality! The crappy piece of elastic waistband rolls as it's not sewn in properly. The material is so thin you can see the tag through it. I would not even pay $5 for this.
2.0,Chain broke after one week.
2.0,Weirdly shaped. Doesn’t fit the front just right and is bigger in the back side.
2.0,The pin arrived already broken off of the stem.
2.0,My fault it was way too small didn't read the slim fit
2.0,Letters came off after 2 weeks! Mask works as intended but it looks old after 2 weeks. I bought this for my 9 year old.
2.0,I bought these for one kid had to give to sister do to them being small
2.0,"It was excellent for the first month of regular usage, but now it tends to click open. The pin that is supposed to sit in the holes also moves as a result. A bit disappointing that it happens after the return window and you have no choice but to write a review. Hope the customer service folks pay attention and send a replacement as it comes loose in the middle of a meeting or while driving. :-("
2.0,"I loved this suit at first, but the bottom stretches out super quickly. After it gets wet. It says and stretching, very unflattering."
2.0,Fun design but very poor fit. Best for a kid or someone with a small head
2.0,Very light and packs a lot into it. Works for what I needed it for. Unfortunately the straps are very loose.
2.0,"I was really excited about this dress, Ive been looking for an easy throw on summer dress but this thing is SHORT! I'm 5'6"" and this thing barely covers my front.. the dark blue color is great but looks like I now have a bathing suit cover up. Super bummed."
2.0,The dress was nice but not very good quality. It was over priced for the bad quality. I was disappointed with the dress
2.0,"Ordered the same size I've always ordered.  Even went to a jewelry store to confirm the finger size hasn't changed, yet this ring had to be greased off the finger because it was 1 to 2 sizes too small."
2.0,I can no longer use the remaining 2/3 of the buckles because both wire needle threaders are now broken.
2.0,"These designs are really pretty, but it gets stuck easily. I had no problem with the sun / moon, but the nebula was stuck for a long time. And the plasticy material was very irritating once stuck. Tip for anyone having this problem: cut a rubber jar opener in half to grip both sides while turning it. It’s the only way it’ll come off."
2.0,"I could not get over the weird swimsuit / bathing suit / beach coverup material. I wanted a sunny brunch dress or summery dinner outside dress, and I got a beach bum dress. If that's what you want, it's awesome for that.<br /><br />I'm 5'3'', somewhere between 125 and 130lb, and the Medium seemed a little big. The model is 5'10'', so this fell below my knee which was expected. My bra strap was also dead center of the keyhole back, so this keyhole fell much lower on me than it does on the model. It was too high to even pin it down. If I sized down that probably would have helped, but probably not enough. Instead of taking this up from the bottom to shorten it, I probably would need to take it up at the shoulders to raise the keyhole? I'm a DD and have yet to find a backless bra that's not a joke, so a giant bra window is a no for me.<br /><br />It cost $20 and it feels and wears like $20, but the model makes it look much nicer."
2.0,Jewelry is nice. The reason for the low rating The post were to large they would not fit in my piercings. I had to return
2.0,"The color is okay, but I would rather a size 12-14 the size 16 is too long"
2.0,Upset to receive only two of the purchased four.
2.0,"decent for the price but lots of glare in the sun, can not see with them on, defeats the purpose."
2.0,Material is very scratchy against the skin.
2.0,"Warm indeed, but you must be 'petite' to wear these!  Even after checking the size chart, I find these run small AND petite.  The top does not reach my hip bones, so I wear it tucked inside the pants to keep it from riding up.  I would buy a different brand next time."
2.0,"Not what you expect on  delivery. Looks better in picture. I hoped for better<br />quality and  and fit, but for the price, it is what  it is. Functional"
2.0,They are to big to wear.
2.0,The material is Steph and not comfortable.
2.0,I ordered black with orange lettering..received black on black. Very nice product if it would of been what I wanted. I emailed and they said that is how I ordered it...I can't prove I didn't but they won't prove I did. Such is life.
2.0,"Blade is much too thick for most of my watches. However, handle is very well made metal."
2.0,"Didn’t go on very smoothly, but did go on. Then after removing to clean, the buckle side wouldn’t go back on the watch. I can get the original Apple band on and off quite smoothly, so clearly an issue with this band. You can feel that the little plastic bump meant to engage with the watch to lock in sticks out much more than the other side of the band. Lasted about 3 weeks. Can’t recommend."
2.0,"Fits great and comfortable,  but completely sheer. I could wear it as an undershirt.  And would need a matching bra. This is underwear/pajamas."
2.0,"This dress would be cute if you’re not very curvy! It runs small, has no stretch, is very sheer, and it’s short. I think it’s cute but definitely size up. If you’re tall it’s above mid-thigh. It’s cheap material but you kind of know that for the price."
2.0,This is far too large for any child I know of. Picture is on me as an adult female with a normal sized wrist. It looks cumbersome and awkward. Returning it for a true kid's watch. Can't speak to the performance as I returned it immediately. I think this watch would be large on the Hulk.
2.0,"Very cute but not very durable, pilled immediately and ripped at seams."
2.0,Shrunk in the wash like CRAZY now I can't wear it anymore. It was a cool shirt before that though.
2.0,Nice necklace.. Missing bracelet!!!
2.0,Bought this for my mom and now it's her go to church bag. I only gave it 3 star because one of the zip broke.
2.0,"Its soft, and has a lovely look but NOTHING like the length shown on the picture,  really really short"
2.0,The picture makes it look like they have depth. They don't. They are flat. I'm pretty sure they will last a whole six days before they fall apart.
2.0,Cheap cheap plastic . But color is pretty cool
2.0,One star for being cute and one star for the nice filters provided.<br /><br />But these are thin polyester blend fabric that is see through. I assumed it would be better quality and thicker cotton material since the CDC suggests thick cotton layers.<br /><br />Was planning on kids wearing this to school. Probably keep for park or lake where not too many people are. $30 down the drain.
2.0,"I loved the finish, and I loved the colors.  However, the part of the earring that sits closest to your ear - front and back - was sharp and could have easily cut my ear if I got bumped in the ear.  The second part that was discouraging is that the curved wire that goes through your ear was too short and I could not get them onto my ear and latch it shut.  I have nice healthy ear lobes, but I would never consider them fat.  These will stay in my jewelry drawer as a reminder to watch what I buy in earrings."
2.0,"The necklace ordered was gold; however, the one inch extension sent with the necklace was silver. The necklace and extension should match."
2.0,"The glasses do fit perfectly however this, case looks and feels like something that would be found at dollar tree.  I love Amazon but I need to be more careful about what I purchase."
2.0,"Too short between waist and in-seam.  Top too small.  Made for shorter women, should show size as Petite.  Unfortunately had to send this set back and pay the return postage.  Awaiting credit to our card."
2.0,"This dress runs vey small and see through on the top. Returning it unfortunately, I really wanted to like it. Gave two stars for the design."
2.0,It was ok nothing to write home about It's okay.
2.0,I suggest you make this at home. Looked nothing like the photo.
2.0,"It is attractive, but it looks and feels as though it is made of lead. There is a disclosure statement on the mailing label for the sender to sign verifying that there are no harmful materials enclosed, but it was left unsigned. Either I'll send it back saying the reason or I'll have to completely cover it with clear nail polish--often."
2.0,"my kiddo LOVED this purse but it has not held up. within a week the stitches were coming loose and now the entire inner lining and zipper has come apart from the bag itself. it looks awful, and we’ve been trying to repair it but it feels like a lost cause. pretty disappointed."
2.0,"I was hoping the bracelet set would have the tiered, color-gradient like the photo. The bracelets inrecieved were uniform in color with an occasional darker colored pearl. Disappointed."
2.0,Love the print! Tore on the inseam on the second wear (and no they were not tight).
2.0,"The colors aren't as vivid as shown in the picture, more reds and oranges - not as many pretty blues to contrast.  Also more of a jersey knit fabric - this isn't a sweater."
2.0,"This does not provide enough support for running, and the cups are not full coverage."
2.0,"I give these two stars instead of one because the fabric is so dog gone cute!! All those llamas. However, they are not worth the money. :-/ I so wish I could say they are. I travel regularly for work, and am always looking for space saving bags. Hence, I purchased these. Upon first try, the zipper broke on one of the bags. They arrived fraying around the edges, and I pulled strings off of the clothing I’d placed in the bags to try out. Annoying. The fabric is very cheap feeling, and a bit “crispier” than I was expecting. Unfortunately, I can’t give these bags a raving review. :-/"
2.0,"product  was a ""Small"" and it was way to big"
2.0,"This is listed as a ladies hat, but it barely fits my head. I have to have the strap on the back fastened on the very last hole/notch, and even then it will pop open if touched. Otherwise, I love the look & feel. The size is more of a youth fit."
2.0,"These shorts have an inner liner that is sewed into the shorts. This is not apparent in the item description and is insanely disappointing. While my shorts do not need to be washed every use, I only wear underwear once per wash cycle."
2.0,"Very stretchy, too small.. I ordered a large and it’s super small.. fit.."
2.0,"Stayed on my feet at first, but a week later they're much wider and flap around in a way that makes them unwearable."
2.0,"Very cheap material and the white is completely see through.  I know you get what you pay for, but this seriously is worth about 5 cents.  The material is basically a piece of elastic.  Don't waste your money!"
2.0,"My 5 year old was so excited about this rainbow print leopard dress for her dance class. It arrived and she was so disappointed when she opened the package. The top isn’t rainbow print at all and is just pink. The bottom, where you can’t see, has a little more variation, but that area isn’t visible."
2.0,"Shorter than it claims! I’m a short person, and this skirt is not maxi!"
2.0,"Well first of all, the seller sent me the wrong size. I received a size large which was way too big for me, but I tried it on anyway to see the bottom and overall look. That's when I noticed how high the slit is - so on a smaller size it would have been even worse probably. Not even kidding, if I sat down my entire crotch would have been exposed. For reference, I'm pretty average size - 5'4"" and ~135lbs, a little wider in the hips."
2.0,I bought the argyle socks because I liked the way they look. Once I got them I noticed that they were very thin. They didn't look like they would last so I define them.
2.0,"The mask looks good and is comfortable. However it is a bit small on me and my face is not larger than average. Also, it took over a month to receive and was refused a refund by the seller that amazon told me I could get because of how late it was..."
2.0,"Soft, decent make, way shorter and smaller than on model. I'm 5'8 so it's a common problem. I'm 230 lbs but the XL is gross tight. Not much shape overall.<br />I would recommend for long torsos/ small boobs/ between 5'2-5'5..."
2.0,They seem like they will break easily.
2.0,Snap isn't strong enough to keep the wallet closed. The pockets are way to long and I have to dig my fingers into the pocket to get my cards..
2.0,"Essentially this is just a piece of elastic with the correct hooks for an iwatch.  The part that hooks into the watch works great and I would have loved this but... the piece of elastic is terribly small and therefore it is uncomfortably tight on my wrist and leaves an indent within an hour.  I have relatively small wrists as I am only 5' 2"" tall and about 110 pounds.  I think that for a larger boned person or a gentleman, this would be a bad purchase.  I don't know if the size M/L would have been just as small or not but I do feel that a size S/M should have fit me comfortably."
2.0,it’s very cheap material
2.0,it is not great but the price is cheap so cannot complain
2.0,"Ordered a xxl, it maybe at best fits at an Xl. If you have a bigger bust I would not purchase this item. It has great potential, if they would just get the sizing right."
2.0,The color of the shirt is not the colored pictured here. Instead of like a burnt orange color it’s bright orange. Very disappointing
2.0,Color is not accurate at all. Yellow appears to be a really light/pastel yellow... this is the color of a taxi cab 😟
2.0,"ok lets start , the egg is amazing i really loved, but the bacon part is horrible ,no one know what he was they keep asking if he was a ketchup bottle or they even make fun of him saying he looks like a bloody knife. Just not ok bacon part sucks."
2.0,Went to wear and the faux buttons fell off as I was straightening the dress.
2.0,The magnetic part sticks to anything that is metal.
2.0,Material look very cheap and runs small
2.0,The lense on these sunglasses has some kind of distortion or something because They make my vision tired as soon I I put them on.  I love how they look and feel but what good is it if I can't wear them.
2.0,Runs small...gaps between the legs where snaps are. Had to use it for sleeping rather than an actual outfit.
2.0,Opening in the leg was shorter than expected
2.0,the socks are too small and too short. unwearable.
2.0,"I looked at the reviews and everybody love this dress, well not me.  It you like shopping a the beauty supply store then you may love this dress...."
2.0,The item looks good but its a iron on.. I do not recommend drying the sweater.. Also i dont think it will last more than 3 washes.. Not worth the price...
2.0,"This is beautiful, but the construction is horrible. The seams pull apart because they weren't finished. I returned one thinking it was a mistake, but the second one arrived in the same condition. To use this I'll have to finish the seams myself."
2.0,Why would you want only one? Hope you guys don't sell boots. :)
2.0,It's kinda cheep.  The neutral shoe polish twist opener popped off on first use.  The brush covers are flimsey.
2.0,"Too long, very thin straps to hold such a heavy dress. The middle cleavage area had a lace that was damaged and unbearable"
2.0,The material was cheap. Not true to fit
2.0,This shirt is white but has somewhat of a blue hue to it. Not sure how it was dyed but it’s not flattering. Also it runs very large.
2.0,These boots are so cute! Sadly mine came defective and it took forever for them to even get to me. It took over 3 weeks for them to come with the strap broken. VERY disappointed. As long as yours come not defective than you will love them.
2.0,"I was hoping for longer, thicker socks.  The photo doesn't really show how very thin they are."
2.0,I was expecting something nicer. These earings look like what I paid for them ($6). I bought them on sale and if I had paid the full price for them I woud have been furious. This makes me think that sellers over inflate the price and then immediately reduce the price to sell so that consumers will assume the quality is better. Obviously it worked on me but I will not buy from Carfeny again in the future.
2.0,This wallet looks cheap and I don't think it will last very long.  I bought for a gift but there's no way I'll give it to my sister.  The inner pocket is tiny.  Not at all what I expected.
2.0,Cheap band
2.0,The flower doesn’t sit on the nose like it shows in the picture so just a little unhappy or not not sure if I’m gonna wear it but it is pretty And I wish the metal was a little thicker than that
2.0,"Demoro demasiado en llegar y no es nada como la foto , compré S y es súper floja , no se ajusta al cuerpo"
2.0,I am a letter carrier I use arm sleeves every day. Well after a couple of day the sleeve started sliding down my arm. It’s a pain that I have to be pulling them up my arm
2.0,This item runs extremely small. Material was not what I expected.
2.0,"I normally wear a L but like things a little loose so sometimes will order an XL, which I did with this. I'm 5'4"" and 172 pounds, bra 38B or C.<br /><br />Pros: The material is very nice, soft & stretchy, and the color is consistent, very pretty cream.<br /><br />Cons: It is cut too tight, I got an XL and it is very tight throughout but especially on the neck and under the arms.  The worst part is that the design, which could have been beautiful, is not sewed correctly so that the neck does not sit flat but sticks up; it's almost as if there is bendable metal strips inside that are making the seams stick out.  The shirt is put on normally, but then you n end to pull two pieces of the material from the back of your neck to the front.<br /><br />The piece that ""wraps"" under the breast area doesn't stay there. It immediately pulls back up and sits halfway over the breast.<br /><br />The front part may sit better under the breast on a size XXL or XXXL instead of an XL (which I was already going up a size on), but the neckline is not designed right so the size would not matter.<br /><br />Returned."
2.0,"They not as pictured, the colors are actually muted tones and they are for a larger wrist"
2.0,"I don’t think they work very well, not as well as what they stated they would."
2.0,Nothing  special
2.0,Very pretty but way too small. Even with the extender it was impossible to wear. I have several 32C bras from several different companies and they all fit perfectly. Disappointed since its really beautiful. Waste of money.
2.0,Turned black after two days of wear
2.0,Shorts were ok although colors dont match pictures
2.0,"The color from this black shirt ran and soaked into my white undershit, ruining the undershirt."
2.0,The adjusters and on the straps got in the way when wearing and are annoying. Same issue with the part that grasp the eyewear.
2.0,Its a one and done band. If you put it on then you better have surgeon hands to change bands. Screen will crack instantly. Band feels cheap. Would not recommend when there are so many better options
2.0,Shirt is see through. Not what I excpeted. Material does not stretch.
2.0,Looks very nice but Very Large.  Would look nice on a football player not most women
2.0,"Not a dress for work,errands, etc. it is a costume dress. A lovely costume, but not something to eat into the real world."
2.0,"I was pretty excited about these pants finally coming in- Sadly, i'm very disappointed. When I first put these on the material immediately rubbed my skin in the wrong places. I ordered a size above my own and the legs were a bit long and bunched up, but the crotch region is way too tight! when I tried to pull them up the belt loops immediately ripped off... It was with barely any effort and was comparable to pulling velcro apart. They look tacky and are not at all worth $30 more like $10..."
2.0,"The yellow scarf isn't yellow like the picture, it's more brown than yellow."
2.0,"Was not flattering at all. Actually made me look heavier, not slender."
2.0,Not too bad for the price!
2.0,Does not hold shape.  Looks like came out of the bottom of a trunk.
2.0,"The picture of the sweater on the website is not how it actually looks or fits...it is definitely not tapered.  Maybe for someone else it may be nice.  But, I ordered it specifically for what I thought was a tapered style."
2.0,I ordered a large because of the size chart. I usually wear a medium or small. I received what was marked as a medium. The top was way to small. Would not cover. The skirt fit in the waist but was about 12 inches too long. I would have loved it if it fit. Shipped quickly
2.0,Cute top but too short. I’ll have to wear a cami underneath. Pretty sure it’ll be a crop top after I wash/dry it. I’m 5’5” & 135lbs and got a medium. I assume the large would be wider but not much longer. Tag has also been cut off.
2.0,"I am 5'1&#34; and 100 lbs, but it was too big for me."
2.0,Beautiful ring but it turned my finger green after 7 hours of wearing it. I am so sad about that :(
2.0,"very comfortable.....but I am 5'5"", 115lbs, and medium is extremely tight.  Wish I had bought size large 😪."
2.0,2 rhinestones fell out in 1 week. Not happy with quality. Beautiful while it lasted.
2.0,"First one used lasted about 3 months, then the black nylon just came unglued from the plastic clip. Fortunately I didn't loose my flashlight I had it attached to. I really don't know if I'm willing to risk loosing my expenseive flashlights with these small and cheeply made lanyards again."
2.0,The underwire is very annoying does not fit my shape
2.0,Poor quality!  I guess you get what you pay for!!
2.0,Nope even close to fitting. Way too small
2.0,"I would like to have been warned about the unusual tailoring of this jacket: &#34;Cut narrow,&#34; for example. From the photo, I actually expected it might be too big and rather tent-like!"
2.0,The mouthpiece is nothing like the photos show.  What I received was a a cheap piece of cardboard that had a sticker on it that put on in a sloppy way because the lines were uneven.
2.0,That rubber lining is not good and not comfortable if u have a big head.  The glasses were falling down my face and when ur riding it's hard to adjust. Also wind comes thru where the nose section is.  It was just an awkward fit for me
2.0,the watch has a nice face an has a good feel. Had to replace the battery as it would not work right out of the box. During the first  day of wearing this Burei sport the crown Guard fell off. The watch looks fine without it but looked much better with it attached. No apparent way to reattach as the holes are not threaded for screws. Was unable to find the original mounting hardware I'm afraid the Guard will remain absent for now.
2.0,Very thin material. You get what you pay for.
2.0,Excellent seller band came fast. Wasn't a fan of the band. I have small wrists and it just didn't look right at all
2.0,Shoulders were to loose
2.0,"The lense degrades guickly when move by your eye, the correct strength is a small area in the center of the lense.<br />They are not worth the money and I would not buy the again!"
2.0,"I had to return the swim skirt because it came down to my knees. I didn't expect it to be that long, and I normally wear a 16 in bottoms, so I ordered an xxl in this and, while it fit, it was really tight in the waist."
2.0,I have a wide foot so I sized up but even with that the shoes didn't fit! Really sucks because they are super cute!
2.0,I like seiko but I cannot recommend this watch. It rattles like something is loose. The watch case shows a sorts of scratches and Mark's. Worst the battery is never full. I dont know if mine is defective or something. I have autos and solar watches I love from seiko but these are junk. For the same money you can get some very nice seiko autos that never need to be fiddled with.
2.0,My daughter has only worn the necklace 3-4 times and already lost one of the balls as the necklace doesn’t latch very well and opens easily 😢
2.0,"Material and ties are fine but size is way too big. bigger than description, definitely not the kids size"
2.0,"The earrings hang heavy to one side, which is not how they’re pictured and look bizarre from both sides. They’re cheap and feel low quality, which coupled with the off balance issue make these a poor purchase."
2.0,Odd Shape
2.0,"Too tight on the thighs for bigger toddlers, other then that really nice panties. I gave them to her cousin who is a size 2t."
2.0,I was hoping these would work for my breast but they didn't they kept coming off of my skin and didn't really lift my breast at all
2.0,"I was very disappointed with the outfit. Workmanship and material is cheap quality, color not exact. I know look and feel of authentic santoon material, this is not santoon or silk as advertised, very cheap polyester material that is hard to feel, pant material is cheaper than what one would use for lining. Instead of embroidery, they have used patches  for the pant with stitching on both edges of pant as if using left overs, making it cheap looking and ugly. Pant is a bigger disappointment. Overall looks cheap as if bought from a local shop selling in open. Oh and the lining does not come all the way to bottom."
2.0,"loved my necklace, but the second it got slightly tugged on the chain broke in half 😭😭"
2.0,One button only<br />Returned
2.0,"I figured I would add my two cents and help buyers make a more well informed purchasing decision. I had high hopes for these glasses based upon the rave reviews, but they look soooo stupid on me! They're too big, in my opinion and the lenses are set apart too wide. I'm not a fan and I know I'll never wear them. The quality of the material is on par for the price, but I am not a fan of the style. I thought they would be kind of simple and cool, but they look like Urkel glasses on me. Shipping took about a month too. What a disappointment."
2.0,They came with a little scratch. My kids loved it that I bought two more despite the scratch. One was to replace the first one.
2.0,Not happy at all with the robe. It is poorly made. I think I’ve maybe worn it twice when my older robe needed washing. My older robe is the same brand so that is why I took a chance on this one. Also noticed a small tear in it.
2.0,"Beautifully soft leather band, but unfortunately, the black ring surrounding the case fell off before I reached the end of the driveway. Still usable, but can no longer wear as a dress watch."
2.0,"The dress was made of cheap quality fabric, like a stretchy polyester material, similar to swimsuit material, but cheaper quality and less stretchy. The stitching in the back of the waistband was a bit uneven. I tried on the dress and it was itchy in the waist area from the very thin petticoat sewn to the inside of the dress. I was rather disappointed because I was hoping for better quality for the price."
2.0,I am in doubt that it is genuine leather
2.0,Supposed to be large/x-large. Fit like a small! Super tight. Very uncomfortable and unflattering. Can't wear these at all. Fabric feels very thin.
2.0,Honestly this dress is so cute but I’m 5’0 tall and the underneed slip was too short on me. The white part on top is also see through. Super cheaply made but would be a great swim cover up maybe.
2.0,"I must stop buying clothes from Amazon. The material is like a parachute cloth, it is not as suggested in ad. Color and style was cute, but too snug in shoulders, and not enough give. I thought it was like a jersey/cotton cloth. The influencer that suggested it on Utube got me—shame on me!"
2.0,"They’re cute but when they get washed, they shrink & are poor quality."
2.0,Looks great from afar. Very cheap materials and the red part looks strange.
2.0,One side of the suspender does not have button holes. Very disappointing that I will have to make my own.
2.0,I bought this for my 11 year old. But it was more for a 5 year old. Had to request a return. It was a cute had though.
2.0,I returned this dress because the top is see through and the burgundy is more of a pink color.
2.0,"As others warned and I didn't listen,figuring I could cut them in half and it would be able to fit fully in the front of my shoes. I found I've wasted my money. there is only one sheet in the package and the diagram on how it should look and fit within the shoe is impossible to recreate."
2.0,"This was poorly made. First it has holes in it and strings everywhere. Second, it looks like it’s made for a child. It is way to small to fit my husband who is 5’11. The penis looks like it comes out of his chest. Very disappointed."
2.0,Gave it to my friend! Super cute nicely made just too small!!!
2.0,I've bought countless pairs of sunglasses and never had a problem. But these came SO bent they don't even stay on the face without falling off. So so so sad. These are beautiful glasses but I can't wear them
2.0,This dress is completely sheer and very short.
2.0,Also it's way to long
2.0,Clasp pin let go after two days.  Only caveat is it was on a bulky watch.  I realize a new pin is an easy fix but won't risk losing the watch if it repeats.
2.0,I'll wear it but it is a very cheaply made too
2.0,"Nice condition, but oversized."
2.0,"My niece loved it, very cute...but it runs big & isn't adjustable which is a bit misleading from pic"
2.0,Fabric nice but it does run really small. Go three sizes up.
2.0,"Bottom too small, waistband too tight but top oversize and okay"
2.0,I got it as a gift and was so embarrassed. I thought it was a real hat. Especially for the price. I way overpaid for the quality of the materials. Cheap plastic halloween hat with a pair of goggle's on it. Terrible.
2.0,The fabric was flimsy and you could see through it.  I thought it might be a little dressier than it was.
2.0,It’s OK. The photos look way better than in person the mat finish is nice but when you would get some thing on it such as lotion or touch it from food it looks bad and it’s hard to wipe off. I ended up returning this.  I would size up a half or quarter.  Pretty snug and not much room for normal fluctuations
2.0,"fit a tad on the small size (for me, I""m usu. a XL) i can scrunch it up 2 fit inside it's own pocket, which is about 6 inches 2 a size. will b good 4 travel since i weighed it & it's only 11/2 lbs.<br /><br />Update:  Stitching tore out after  using it a few times. I'll try something else next time."
2.0,Button and threaded button hole for the fly completely came apart after the first day.<br />Sticthing on this is low quality. I dont know if they are all lile that or if these just slipped through quality control before they shipped them to me.
2.0,Love the print but did not fit the active.
2.0,"i'm 5'10 and the XL is 3 inches above my knee, fits too small"
2.0,fit like a YOUth medium
2.0,"Product description is accurate.<br /><br />The reason this product received only two stars from me is that of the 40 pieces that were sent to me, 10 of them did not work.<br />The price was low enough so that shipping the entire package back would not have been worth it."
2.0,"Im a small . The bottoms fit fine. But the top was very loose and the fabric was thin. Im a 34C , i felt uneasy wearing the top so i kept the bottoms and bought a differnt top for it."
2.0,Beautiful dress great qua fabric.  But button fell right off as I pulled the dress out of the package.  Also not enough room even in an XL for a D cup.  My cup runneth over.
2.0,Way too small for my 6 year old.
2.0,Much thinner and shorter than expected
2.0,Basically a knock off. No luminous emblem
2.0,"Its wide, its scratchy, its see through, and it's an off white color, not beige.<br />Really not a fan of this. Only gave it two stars because its wearable I guess but not comfortably so."
2.0,I was disappointed in the fit of this jacket. I bought it for my son and he normally wears an XL. I wanted to be cautious because some of the reviews said it fit on the small side so I went with the XXL and it is way too small. If fits him more like a men's medium.
2.0,"I would not recommend these socks. The idea is great (this the two stars) however, they were very short, just above the ankle so unless you wear sandals with these there is no seeing nick! Also, they began to fuzz and pull apart after trying them on. For reference my husband is a size 11, I am an 8, did not work for either of us. So wanted to love these. Maybe we got a defective pair. Sending back."
2.0,"The jewelry is nice enough however, the shaft between the two hearts is short and doesn't fit correctly.  Since the shaft is short there isn't any room for the jewelry to move and it is very uncomfortable."
2.0,"This sweater has a very odd fit, even for an open front cardigan, and the material is a little cheap.  Ordered a large, and the sleeves seem to fit OK, but the cardigan barely stays on my shoulders.  An x-large might fit better, but I will just keep this size and use for wearing around the house in fall/winter instead. Little disappointed that I cannot wear it out."
2.0,"I like the look of these shoes. They are ok comfort wise, I like the wide toe, and zipper. BUT there is a strong chemical smell attached to the shoes. It’s been 48 hours since I got them. I tried wearing them yesterday and had the change shoes half way through the day. I tried again today and as I’m sitting here the chemical fumes are wafting up my nostrils. I honest can’t take it. I will wait a few more days to see if the smell goes away but I may have to return if it doesn’t. Such a shame. Cute shoe."
2.0,"The pattern and matrial of the band is nice. But the pins are too small, so I cannot even put it on my Versa Lite."
2.0,"Very cute baby bloomers, but fell apart after a few washes"
2.0,"My daughter watered the garden with the watch on the other day. Today she discovered condensation inside the watch. She didn’t swim with it, just got some water on her hands from a garden hose. It also stopped vibrating and started to beep instead at set alarm times. Not sure why."
2.0,"Washed a few times, lost its shape and faded."
2.0,"purse is nice, was supposed to come with Harley dog tags and they were not with the purse.  I contacted the seller and no response.  Way to sell a product."
2.0,Had to return; cut into my nose and were unusable.  Got some compliments though on the unique look.
2.0,The size stated was not comparable to other manufactures.
2.0,Like the ribbing but smaller than expected
2.0,They are cheaply made and break easily if not very careful with them . They are cute though .
2.0,I ordered 6 x and it will fit a 2x. It was very soft but I was very disappointed in the size issue.
2.0,Bought these and thought they would hold up great....that wasn’t the case. They are easily scratched even when handled carefully in a case.
2.0,Nothing to this tank top. Just super boring and dull. They must be selling because of the model's .... assets.
2.0,You could put two people inside the neck of the shirt. Disappointed.
2.0,"The remotes work, but not every time. The range is not very good either"
2.0,"The colors are not the same as the product picture. The product shows a pink stripe on top with a reddish stripe near the bottom. My sweater is completely orange, grey and brown, and white. Not nearly as cute in my opinion. Very fall though."
2.0,The components shorted out and stopped working.  While we have taken some walks in light rain this light hasn’t been subjected to unreasonable moisture exposure - it stopped working three weeks after buying.  Water got into it and caused a electrical short - looks a bit burned.<br /><br />It’s a horrible idea to buy this for your pet - we’ve used similar products in the past & never had problems like this.<br /><br />In addition this thing also would get turned on just by the dog laying down certain ways.<br /><br />Don’t buy this.
2.0,Too large and requested return but the email I got was invalid.
2.0,This bib is very thin. There is no backing out anything. It soaks right through.
2.0,These are beautiful.  Too bad the posts bent in half the first time I tried to put them in. Will be sending back.
2.0,"These were definitely not as expected. I bought them as a gift and now I have changed my mind, as they are so big, almost to the point of being bell bottoms."
2.0,Product says it runs true to size is wildly incorrect. I gave it to my sister in law as she wears 3 sizes smaller than me and it fits her perfectly
2.0,"Band was way too tight...I'm gonna use an extender... very stiff, and uncomfortable"
2.0,The sizes seem to run small relative to  U.S.A sizes.
2.0,Very disappointed with the size
2.0,"Cute hat, but doesn’t stay on very well. For that reason unfortunately I don’t wear it."
2.0,The sleeves specifically... VERY NARROW.!!!!!!
2.0,Not true to size at all ordered a 4xl and they are about a xl. Super annoying.
2.0,i cut the under sheath off and wear a sleeveless tee with it. beautiful.
2.0,The pants fit great but the neck hole for the sweatshirt was too small. After one wash the outfit pilled and made it look so cheap
2.0,"Like a few other reviewers has stated, the eye openings are too small. My eyes can't even open fully with the mask on, so I'm going to trim the edges to see better."
2.0,We ordered this mask and were very unhappy to find it does not fit the normal adult size face but rather a petite or child size face. We had to spend time and money finding another and were lucky we found something that did not take long to receive. This seller should have been more clear on the size.
2.0,Never used it. I purchased 0-3 months and looked like it would fit a baby born in September but I hated the fabric. All of the turkeys were upside down and you really had look to figure out what was on it. Just not as expected.
2.0,It was too long and no XS!
2.0,"This is very stretchy but it is very thin and shows every little lump and bump. It also kind of hangs (at least on me) because it is so stretchy. I am quite thin so I try to avoid things that hang (I feel like I end up looking like a wire hanger under the dress, not an attractive look). Anyway, I tend to go for more tailored styles that avoid this issue, but I decided to give this dress a chance. I did not like it at all and returned it."
2.0,The top I received does not look like the one in the picture. The fabric and cut of the top are different.  The sizing tag of the top was sewn on upside down (just an observation) and the fit of the top ran very large on the one I received  (did not fit as expected).  I was so looking forward to wearing this because I really liked the printed design but  there was no way to make it work…
2.0,If you are busty these are not for you. Otherwise they would be perfect but I do not fit in them up top.
2.0,doesnt fix like I thought
2.0,I loved the detail about this skirt I was really hoping it would fit. I ordered the smallest size and it fit good around my waist but it was too large around my hips and legs. It did not flatter my body at all. The material wasn’t that great but if it would have fit I definitely would have rocked it.
2.0,size runs smaaaaalll
2.0,"The display of these earrings can't be beat, they come in the adorable pouch, that's actually rather thick fabric and nice! However, that's where the ""nice"" ends. One earring came with the post badly bent, and I won't try to bend it back, I'm afraid it will simply come off completely. Then, the ""jewels"" ... both earrings have all of their jewels, but one had an extra glued onto the outside of the ""wreath"", and it doesn't want to come off. Quality control on these is non-existant.  IMO they're not worth the money. One thumb down."
2.0,Can't believe how poorly made these are. The top layer of the sole peeled off after about a month of use.
2.0,"I really liked the color and style of this shirt.  It fit just like I wanted,  almost,  it was way too small across the shoulders.  I couldn't move my arms forward at all. It was so odd that it fit perfectly everywhere else.  I had to send back it was unwearable."
2.0,These were too small for my face. I’ll have to give them away to someone else.
2.0,"I don’t mind the wide look, but it is very short (even more after washing), and I am short. The material is cotton, not polyester as stated. It feels like cotton and it says cotton on the tag. It is a thick cotton by not particularly high quality. The neck and hem are what gives this shirt away as cheap."
2.0,fabric
2.0,I liked these because you could adjust the fit for children. I was having a hard time finding masks that would fit them but these worked well. The material is also nice and soft. The only issue is that the metal nose piece for one mask is already poking through.  I assume it is just a matter of time before this happens to the others. Its so sharp I can't have my kids wear that one so it's going in the garbage. I tried to shove it back in and thought we could sew it shut but that doesn't seem to be possible.
2.0,"Won't wear it, too much of a hassle to mail back."
2.0,No support for a larger chest. Breasts sagged. Pads are half the circumference of my breast so you could see a ring under clothes.
2.0,Material is thin and almost see through. Not impressed by quality of dress.
2.0,Cute!  But not enough support for a new walker.
2.0,"stone and setting are nice, but the backing keeps coming slipping out of the earring. poorly designed."
2.0,"I spent time reading the reviews about how these pants fit.  Most reviewers said they run large so be sure to order a size down.  So, I did!  If anything I would say they run small instead of large.  There was mention of some of the style numbers varying and the one I ordered to be insured that I would receive them in time for a trip were the ones that did not run large.  Also, even though I'm a loyal, avid Amazon customer I had recently purchased 2 pair of slacks just like these at our wholesale club and the fabric was also rayon.  The Slim-Station brand may launder and hold up better but I had to send back due to size issue."
2.0,The straps on the back hold it on your shoulders and are constantly pulling them off.  Aside from that it is too small but a cute little leotard
2.0,"The size and quality of this purse are great, however the color description is very deceiving; I ordered a beige thinking it would look somewhat like the first picture but I was very disappointed to see a light caramel color like, even darker that it shows in the second picture with the mannequin. I double checked my order and the add to make sure I didn't receive the wrong color but I guess this is the new beige :("
2.0,Cute but SHORT. I will have to wear it over leggings.
2.0,The way it made I did not like
2.0,"Problem with Nike is the sizes seem to be always a half size too small, and to narrow.  When you adjust to get a pair to fit, then they seem to big and wide."
2.0,Sung after washed<br />Don't dry it
2.0,I didn't like it too much when I received it the color was off putting.
2.0,"I usually wear a size 10. This was snug around the middle. Nice dress, tho."
2.0,Cute dress. Looks a little cheap but I think it’s because of the print. A solid color dress would be better. Unfortunately it’s already fading after a wash.
2.0,"Although the swim suit appeared to be of good quality, the bottoms were significantly different then portrayed in advertisement image."
2.0,"I have been using a regular straight bar and I was excited to order this so I could try the other three styles and see what I liked best but unfortunately when it arrived it did not have any of the L shaped bars and the hoops are we too small. When you try to open the hoops to actually put them on the metal is so crappy I snapped three of them. The only reason I gave 2 stars were because the other bar style had very pretty ones & I did at least get the amount I order, since they doubled the hoops I can't wear instead of sending the L ones"
2.0,Runs large and had to return
2.0,The shirt is cute but the fabric is a bit thin and it runs small.
2.0,Fit way too tight despite sizing way up!  An immediate return.
2.0,very difficult to attach Im glad I didn't pay much for them
2.0,These break very easily and all 3 pair have broken within a short amount of time from normal use.
2.0,"Can't complain about the size as it was stated in the description, ergo two stars instead of just one.  Probably should have made a cut-out of the dimensions before I purchased it.  I have average size hands for a woman, but found it almost too large to hold comfortably in one hand.  However, I would be able to deal with that IF ONLY the outside material wasn't so slick.  Without slipping you wrist through the strap, it is just about impossible to pick up or hold.  I knew it wouldn't be leather, but surely there is some material with a bit of a grip for a wallet this size!  I also would have preferred that the strap was attached to the zipper.  It is separate on different ends of the wallet.  Another thing I find annoying is the change purse.  Not convenient at all.<br />Not yet sure about the charger.  Like the idea, but can't tell a difference after leaving my Droid Mini plugged in for a few hours.  Will try again tomorrow and will revise, if there is any improvement.<br />Definitely can't recommend this item.  I purchased nearly everything in my house online, but it was the first online purchase of a wallet.  Won't do that again.  Seems to be one of those items better purchased in an brick and mortar store.<br />Update:  I have had a chance to use the battery charger and it actually works quite well provided, of course, it is fully charged.  Still, can't add stars.  it is a very uncomfortable wallet.  Need to use two hands for everything and even then it is slippery and change is very ""loose"".  I doubt it was designed by a woman."
2.0,I liked it until it turned green
2.0,"The flowers are huge and ugly. They hardly look like Daisy flowers. I bought it for a few bucks so who cares, but don't waste your money."
2.0,Not so nice and the quality is not the best.
2.0,I thought they are overpriced for the quality.
2.0,"Not what I expected, doesn’t loook like the picture!"
2.0,"fit perfectly but not the color i expected, its closer to a red than a burgandy"
2.0,Ripped👎
2.0,The product runs small
2.0,I did not like the attachment band. I liked the size of them but did not feel like the quality was there. I returned them for another pair from a different company.
2.0,"The pattern of the fabric is as pictured but the stitching and fit of the dress is all over the place. I am super super sad about it because the stock image is adorable but when I tried it on, the top half was HUGE and the way the waist hit was just..very unflattering. The elastic material at the waist was very scratchy inside as well. Maybe I received just a dress from a bad batch?"
2.0,Cheaply made but if your getting it for a specific reason it will work for that one time use
2.0,Color is almost red instead of brown leather. I don't like the material how it feels
2.0,Was disappointed at the sole of the shoes.  Was extremely soft and flimsy and wouldn't stay much of a chance worn outside a few times especially by a toddler.  Returned.
2.0,"I take a 1x and i could not get this past my shoulders.. i would say this was a childs small if even that , wound up giving this to a little girl"
2.0,The material didn’t look on the higher level
2.0,"Don't waste your money, Flea Market quality, flimsy material and muddy colors, nothing like the picture shown. If it had been for me I would have returned it but it was a gift."
2.0,"It’s cute for your right ear, but it does not have design on both sides as described, so on your left ear it looks backwards"
2.0,Poorly cornstructed !!!
2.0,Too short for someone 5'10&#34; and while the top fit fine the skirt was actually tighter than I expected.  I am returning it.
2.0,Zippered openings on pockets are unreasonably small.  I really don't know what they were thinking.
2.0,"Ordered a Large, as I saw the reviews to order a bigger size, still too small around the armpits.  And SHEER!  You can see right through this material.  Not very happy with it."
2.0,This ring is beautiful. I would easily give it 5 stars but the sizing is no where near accurate. The ring is way too small. The company was great about giving me a refund though.
2.0,"I bought the M/L size since I'm typically a S or M and didn't want too small. However, the romper stretched out after wearing it once to the point that it felt like an XL. I returned the romper as it was very unflattering at that point. Other than that, it was cute and very soft."
2.0,"Absolutely do not like this product at all. The concept is great, but they don't work well for the shirts I need. If you had a real thin shirt they might work fine. The shirts I have are thicker and you can't get the material to lock into the clips. I'm going back to the clamp style ones that attach to your socks. They did a much better job. Extremely disappointed in these shirt stays."
2.0,"I selected the blue color version, because it looks more believable online and the blue SZs can pass for sapphires. What a huge disappointment it was when I saw the bracelet in person! Phony looking stones beyond believe! Considering the bracelet is not made of silver and not even tarnish free, I waisted my money and don’t recommend it."
2.0,Cute but really hurt my ear
2.0,"The watch look nice at nice face nice band but the class has issues, the class doesn't really secure as it should"
2.0,The boots were beautiful but did not last.  The logo came off the side and the sole started pulling away from the boot.  Just not the quality I expected.
2.0,Cute hat. Unfortunately its ginormous so I will be returning it.
2.0,These dresses Run Asian small but they are long to your ankles literally! I sent them back!
2.0,This just fit oddly. The shoulders and sleeves were large. Almost like a short-sleeved batwing. The chest fit fine (I'm not small in the chest) but then it was snug through the hips.  The shoulders might have been cute if it wasn't so snug around the hips.  And i couldn't size up because then the sleeves would have been rediculous.
2.0,"I ordered what was supposed to be a tank for my very skinny friend. However, she can't fit in this. First of all, this is not a tank top. Tank tops fall below the belly button and this one comes above. Second, it runs on the small side. It includes a padded bra and the fabric is super soft. I do not feel this would be supportive enough for running but for light workouts it would be great. The problem is the short style. I can see this is more for a teenager. I also feel the current price of $29.99 is too expensive for this."
2.0,They are a nice touch for any child. Main complaint is how they are uneven. As very uneven. Thought my son was wearing them wrong but it is just the glasses. But they were cheap so what should I have expected
2.0,"These masks didn't fit me well. Also, the plastic gets fogged every time you breath so anyway the lips are not visible."
2.0,it fits awkwardly and is shapeless.
2.0,The clasp opened up and my Fitbit dropped out.  Thank goodness I found it! Afraid to wear it.
2.0,"Im a 200 pund guy and the straps on this thing are just a hair tighter then they should be.  If you need to cart around anything that is moderately big this probably isnt the thing for you.  Its higher quality, but it obvious they only tested it on women and smaller men."
2.0,"I'm not sure who they measured for a D cup but it sure wasn't me, and I was recently measured at Victoria's secret. these are so small they allow the side of the breast to be exposed, which is uncomfortable. I also worry about the damage to breast tissue when you pull them off as they are very sticky and stretch the skin when removed."
2.0,They break  easily
2.0,I just purchased this set and the bracelet clamp  was broken.....
2.0,"I really liked the way these fit and was happy with them at first. I followed the cleaning instructions, but I did not have them for a very long before the grip started peeling in many places. Pretty disappointing, considering how many good reviews."
2.0,Just delivered. Love the color and style but the middle size luggage already have dent on the top corner. My middle and small luggage have cracks inside where the telescopic handle is screw on.
2.0,"Nothing like the picture... more like a black and blue heather, and very cheap. So disappointed that I wasted money on two of these sweaters."
2.0,"Very cute, tarnished after 2 wears."
2.0,The pegs kept coming off. Looks pretty though
2.0,"I got this as a Christmas gift for my 13 year old daughter, who was dying to have one.  Photo on Amazon looks good and was a decent price.  Actual sweatshirt is very thin material and not the hoodie she so desperately wanted.  She's barely worn it at all because it looks cheap and when you're 13, it's all about how your clothes look."
2.0,They are pretty from the front. The back is painted silver like the plastic rhinestones that you would find in walmart. I expected crystols.
2.0,Did not like dress ordered larger size too small.
2.0,"As other reviewers have stated, the drape is awkward - it should be more of a 'slit' in the back, but instead, it's just missing a huge chunk of fabric. As such, even on my fairly fit frame, it sticks out like a schoolgirl dress in my hips and makes me appear as though I'm going to fly away. While I like how it looks when tying it in the back, I purchased one shirt with the intention of being able to wear it two ways. So, not for me. (The purply color is lovely.) Just buy their regular tank."
2.0,"Cute, but broke almost immediately out of the package.<br /><br />I will be able to fix it with a jewelry kit, but kind of disappointed that I have to do that before I even got a chance to wear them."
2.0,Cute but cheap cheap cheap dye comes out when washed beware
2.0,I am so disappointed in this short pans. The material is hard and uncomfortable to wear.  Seems to be of poor quality. It looks like my waist is thick and my legs are fat.  I won't wear it outside in the future.
2.0,damn i wanted to love this...im 5' 2&#34; and somehow im too tall for this!!?? WHHAAT!! Damn it!!! it fits like a half shirt. VERY DISAPPOINTED!!
2.0,"Poorly packaged (came all tangled and it took me 5 to 10 minutes to untangle).  Not sure that it's a real pearl because it looks like it's peeling.  It is pretty, but maybe not worth the price."
2.0,"Very nice, but made the shoulders very broad"
2.0,I ordered this product 2 different times in 2 different sizes  and none of them fit.  I take an XL but the 1st time I bought 2X and they were too small so I returned them and bought 2 more in 3X and they didn't fit either. Very disappointed. They are very pretty but they run very small and what you get bears no resemblance to the size you ordered.
2.0,Cheap quality & definitely not worth the price !!!<br />Don’t buy it !!
2.0,"Bottom strap rolls, clasp area is scratchy and uncomfortable; very disappointed, would return them if I could."
2.0,I purchased these boots and thought they were really nice. Well I  apparently didn't wear them first. First time wearing the boots  the material feels really cheap as well as the heel coming off. Needless to say They are in my closet in the box. Will not purchase this brand again.
2.0,Its cute fits ok to.
2.0,Whelp it’s broken already. The bee fell of and I lost It. That was a waste. So annoyed.
2.0,"Had to return, they run very small"
2.0,Very small I should have looked at the measurements opposed to looking at the picture
2.0,"Holy crap! it won't come off once you put it on! even with the little kit that supposed to help taking it off, it bent and broke.. you will lose your nails trying to take the case off.. looks good though"
2.0,"Made well enough, but didn't see the polarized effect & didn't get dark enough outside, for me. Returned them."
2.0,"The fabric is nice, the size is ok, the handles...oh, the handles. As shown in the pic, they’re twisted and it’s cute. They’re not sewn like this so one strap is actually about 3 inches longer and you twist them yourself. They don’t stay twisted. And I couldn’t figure out how to even knot it to make it stay twisted.  Cute but weird."
2.0,Not enough support for a C or D cup body
2.0,"Cute, BUT pearls all fell off the first wash and the black batgirl image faded immediately."
2.0,"I liked the style of this watch! i was very happy with the product BUT the glass cracked very fast definitely not a durable product! wish I would have known, or else I wouldnt have bought it."
2.0,These were unwearable as they came from the store.  I had to have the tags surgically removed to avoid the scratchy irritating stitching.  This included removal of the little clips that secure the two gloves into a pair.  The latter were the worst. After removal they required the seams to be re-sewn.  Simply cutting the tags did not eliminate the issue.  companies pay no attention to details like this apparently.
2.0,This t shirt looks so great in the pictures but that's not actually what you get.  The front of the shirt has a seam right down the middle of the shirt that looks horrible.  I returned this shirt for a refund.
2.0,2 pairs broke the first time I wore them
2.0,Smaller than I expected good for show not for looking up close there’s two Aries keys but no Capricorn they’re too tiny most of the keys didn’t look the same like the ones in the show
2.0,"The leggings seemed good quality at first. Nice, thick material. Almost too thick- the compression is definitely there. So much that it flattened out my butt a bit. That wasn’t the most flattering on me. The leggings were A bit tight initially and Loosened up just right after walking around the house for a bit. Unfortunately, I was about to try them forA workout that same day when I noticed a run by the crotch. I’m glad I checked, otherwise it could have been a disaster at the gym tearing and revealing everything. For this reason I had to return and give it a two star rating. They should inspect quality before shipping out. It’s inconvenient to the customer."
2.0,Sleeves are made strangely and feets weird.
2.0,"Is beautiful but is somewhat small, I did not found next size. I thought it was to fit but I needed a median /8 size. The arrival was so fast thank you!"
2.0,The material is a little clingy and the size is small. I comfortably wear a large but ordered an XL and it did not fit properly. It clung and hung uncomfortably in all the wrong places. I feel this dress would be good if you go two sizes up what you normally wear. (I'm 5'8'' and 215 pounds)
2.0,It is a lot smaller than I thought it would be. The chain is so small I can't wear it around my neck. I got it for Christmas and I still haven't worn it. It could almost be a bracelet.
2.0,"Since the other review doesn’t allude to the quality of this necklace, I will. The necklace arrived fairly quick. Packaged in a big envelope and inside a small cheap jewelry case. The necklace itself was GORGEOUS! I had some trouble realizing that in order to get a certain letter you had to go into the design color menu and find your letter and color by sliding all the way through all of the options. A little difficult. The only thing about this necklace is I’m pretty sure over time it may turn green or pink. It just felt a bit cheap. The necklace chain broke on the FIRST DAY. I just think it would have needed a stronger chain but it was a bit embarrassing when I got it for a friend as a gift and she had only wore it for the day before it broke. I wouldn’t buy it again, but it was cute!"
2.0,It's nice but not long
2.0,I have to send the second pair back they broke in the same place as the other ones did when I put them on
2.0,The bottom block of color is off white. Makes the coloring look awful.
2.0,"I brought the grey nightgown, it’s a lovely color but even after washing it twice, the fabric is very stiff and not soft enough for my liking."
2.0,"These MIGHT be oversized sunglasses for a child! Whoever the man is in the photo which looks like the glasses take up half his face must be the smallest man in the world. Everything about the size of these sunglasses says ordinary. For ordinary, they're not bad, but I wanted oversized. Oh well."
2.0,"1) Fabric is tissue thin-would make fine p.j. pants, but wouldn't wear them out.<br />2) If you're still determined to order, go two sizes up.<br />3) Shipped from China, takes a while to receive."
2.0,Ordered this helmet twice and both times received an infant sized helmet.
2.0,It is nicely designed however cheaply constructed. torn up after one wear.
2.0,I wear medium size but i had a hard time zipping this up.. it was too big around the chest area and too tight in the waist.
2.0,Fabric is definitely not what I expected.  Would not purchase again.
2.0,These may look like Sweetaluna leggings but the material is slick...Can't desccribe it any other way....Doesn't even feel like material....Haven't worn them outside so I dont know the warmth factor but these wlll be spending more time in my drawer.... Not happy...
2.0,"There was nothing wrong with the panties except for the fact that they were not the style that it said they should be.  These were just regular cotton briefs not Cool Comfort.<br />Also, they took considerably longer to get here than they should have."
2.0,"Ugly, cheap, and smelled horrible when I got it."
2.0,"This does not have a &#34;washed&#34; look at all like I was expecting! It is in fact very black. The &#34;washed&#34; should be taken out of the item description, this is disappointing!  There are just a few faux tears on the bill, but other than that it is shiny black plastic mesh with a very black front and bill.  I sent it back."
2.0,"Quality isn’t the best, zipper doesn’t work well."
2.0,Buy it if you don’t have to remove any links. The pins holding the links are cheap metal. They bend very easily. The link removal tool is equally cheap but works. I removed three links. In the course of removal I bent three pins and the installation tool. And I’m pretty careful.
2.0,"Quality was not what I expected, but then again, you get what you pay for :) My grand kids will enjoy it"
2.0,The product was comfortable and easy to use. But I slipped and fell once and the side straps snapped right off. No integrity at all.
2.0,Just meh. I didn't like the fit on me.
2.0,"TOO BIG/LONG. I'm 5'3'' and 135 lbs and this shirt was way too long to look decent tied in the front. It was also baggy for a SMALL. I LOVED the material and flow of the shirt, super comfy for hot days but it did not work for me."
2.0,The sleeves were short i thought the 1st one was just a defect that i order but it came the same way again. They do not have the zipper pockets in front like other suppliers have...i have this outfit in blue from a different seller and paid more money but the quality was better so i wouldnt buy fron here again
2.0,"My husband bought these in September and already 3 of the 6 pair have holes in them after the material has separated. He has had to discard them. Just to clarify, he has had other brands for years. He did like these at first, but for longevity purposes, would not buy again. Hope this helps."
2.0,Too small order up too  some
2.0,"This dress isn’t at all what is pictured. The torso of the dress is shirt and stumpy with no shape at all. I ordered a medium and it makes me look 5 sizes bigger. The waste band is under the breast rather than at the waist as pictured, and the material is cheap. I returned it and chose something else for the gala."
2.0,"After spending several hundred for these they were my &#34;big&#34; Christmas gift for my wife. They looked great & my wife loves them but I expected more. First, they arrived UPS in a padded envelope. Fortunately no shipping damage but the potential was high. The earring box was a real cheezy white box with a black velvet one inside. Not the kind of packaging one would expect for an expensive piece of jewelry.<br /><br /> Upon opening, the earrings were stuck in a plastic bag & not even mounted to prevent damage. I had to help my wife remove one of them with small pliers since the very thin locking arm was bent.<br /><br />I recommend Amazon to demand improvement from this vendor."
2.0,showed up and the hands were loose. not sure if thats packaging issues or what. Not a great first impression.
2.0,This ended up being cheaper made and lighter weight than I'd hoped for.. It seems very much like a dollar store kind of purchase.....
2.0,Very shapeless. The color is  between &#34;bubblegum&#34; and &#34;coral&#34;
2.0,These are alright.. I bought them to use for both sides of my nostrils but they were very hard to get through because of the flat threaded ends. It took me an hour to get both of them through and get the balls on and then I had to take them out a day later because they inflamed my piercing sites from having to jam them through. Kinda disappointed cause they looked cute but 🤷🏼‍♀️
2.0,The band is not pretty at all.  Looks like it was just thrown in.  It is see through. Need to find something to put under.
2.0,It is not terribly ugly. But it looks too obviously inexpensive. Flows well but not for me.
2.0,Order a size up way to small
2.0,Hats are great quality and colors are actually as pictured....But beanies did NOT have the hole for ponytail.
2.0,Nice thickness But They roll constantly.
2.0,I thought I was gong to like these a lot. I wanted something to wear on cooler days. The seam split after 4 wearings and am unable to repair due to the fabric. Would not purchase again.
2.0,"I'm not a large person by any means, 5'3 to be exact, and this is rather small on me. It's a bit scratchy but still seems to be will put together. It shows that is long but it in fact is not."
2.0,"Ummm it was great material wise, sheer as expected. But it did not fit my the way it was supposed to."
2.0,"jacket seems nice but where is the fleece?  it is a thin hoodie, almost see through. would not keep me warm in cold weather."
2.0,"Style is okay, but beware! The white is NOT white, it is between off white and cream colored."
2.0,"It arrived very timely which was nice which was just about the only thing worthwhile about this item, it is a cheap piece of plastic that barely fits my hand, it can't move at all, and it was shaped for someone with extremely long and slender fingers. The delivery time is the only reason this doesn't get one star. Hopefully the return speed is just as fast."
2.0,"I bought these for my 3.5 year old daughter, I bought size 2-3 years considering people said they ran big.<br />Well they were easy to get on but kept falling off as the elastic was not tight enough around her wrists and the velcro pretty much did nothing. Wish I could return them! When on though they did keep her hands warm and she liked them for playing in the snow."
2.0,Neck is not Good sweing. it is not setted properly. Strap of bag is very small to hang in neck.
2.0,Beautiful parasol. However the first one arrived snaped nearly in half. I was sent a replacement in a very timely manner. This new one is broken on two tips that I had to glue so I could use it for my event. Cheaply made.
2.0,I did not like the fit of these pants. They fit way too big. Very baggy.
2.0,"I bought 2 of these dresses in the SAME size, from the same seller, yet this peach is so much smaller than the black (but it is a LARGE). Disappointed"
2.0,"Unfortunately the boots were too small. We ordered the same size as all my two-year-old's other Footwear + ½. He can barely move in then, let along wear thick winter socks and go play. We plan to return these boots."
2.0,"I wear a XXL.  This XXL fits like a L. Also, it smelled strongly of chemicals."
2.0,Ordered a size larger and still small.
2.0,"Very cute, lightweight T-shirt. Runs EXTREMELY small. I normally wear a large and got the XXL and it looks like spandex :( so cute just so small.."
2.0,Very cute but fits small especially in the bust area
2.0,"I received this bath wrap and was disappointed because it was too tight and uncomfortable. The elastic at the top of the wrap pinched and made the garment feel confining. This bath wrap was listed as one size fits all, but it's the smallest one size fits all I have ever encountered."
2.0,This bra is not made for any kind of impact exercise. There is zero support. Maybe if you want it for yoga it would work? Or if you are flat chested.
2.0,I have bought many Landsend products through the years…this one is very disappointing….
2.0,"The pants are good quality and comfortable, but I received the wrong color. I can't return them because I live outside the US. I contacted the seller and they directed me to Amazon because it was an Amazon-fulfilled purchase; Amazon, on the other hand, only gives me the option to return them. So basically I'm stuck with a color that is not at all what I chose based on my workout clothes. I would consider buying another pair, if I could be sure I got what I ordered. But that is just not the case. Very disappointed. I give them 3 stars because the product itself is good. Just mind that you might not get what you order."
2.0,"Ok, I should have returned this purchase but I was too lazy.  The belt looked fine, but absolutely reeked of mildew.  My bad, I just threw it out.  I have others of these belts, but only this one had the awful stench."
2.0,Disappointed in the color. The pants I received were black and blue not blue and blue.
2.0,The product is good quality but the ad is deceiving.  There was only a picture of four cases with bags and no option to select anything.  So I thought I was getting four cases.  Now the price is really about right for a single case and bag but the option to pick my color would have been nice.  My husband didn't appreciate the lavender.
2.0,"Returned, did not fit and did not look at all like the picture.  I normally where a medium and ordered an Extra large looking at other reviews. It was pretty in the package, just not for me."
2.0,I found the vest to be very short for me and the bonus arm/ankle bands were missing. The vest is a good quality however.
2.0,Didn’t fit well.
2.0,I wear a 10-12 pant.  I bought a large and this wasn't even close to fitting. Super disappointing.
2.0,The only thing good about these is that why’re cheap! I got rhwww for my daughters farm party. Figured animal print with a few other girly designs would be fine. But there are 7 animal print only in this whole bundle. I’m extremely disappointed
2.0,Side pockets not big enough at all for me.
2.0,It was absolutely beautiful but the sizing was way off. Im about 5'8 womens size 12 top and bottom. I ordered the 2XL for my mother 5'7&#34; womens size 18 top and bottom. When she told me it was cut like a M/L i didnt believe her. Sure enough It was snug on me and impossible for her.
2.0,"The owl is a little gawdy looking, and a little larger than I expected. It is okay for the price."
2.0,"Unlike other beautiful dresses by this vendor I own, this dress is weird, with super broad shoulders and sticking out sleeves. Very unflattering too."
2.0,Did not read description that closely and just assumed it was cotton. I do not care for the material. It is slippery and seems cheap.
2.0,"Much brighter than pictured. The colors look like they could glow in the dark, especially the orange. Good sturdy cotton and design."
2.0,"Quality seems cheap & I’m concerned the zippers may not hold. Also, there is no back plate so it’s not very comfortable if you’ve got it fully loaded.<br />I replaced it within a year & now it’s just collecting dust."
2.0,"it is a very pretty charm , but it was so sad that the chain broke first time it was worn bummer"
2.0,As I saw on the reviews the zipper broke after<br />2 wears.
2.0,These don't feel like cotton to me. my feet are sweating.
2.0,"Didn’t come with some of the pieces that I was looking forward to, came with others in their place that I am unlikely to actually use."
2.0,They are very cute and super lightweight however the brown pair are two different earrings. One has big dots and one has tiny dots. The grey pair has damage on the bottom of one. Disappointed with the quality.
2.0,It fell apart pretty fast.
2.0,"The material is super soft and I also love that the length is actually perfect (I’m 5’9), BUT the material to too thin and see through."
2.0,Very tight on the child’s face as the size chart recommends. But too lose more a younger child. Too large for my 4 year old but too tight for my 8 year old.
2.0,"Looks great, great design....unfortunately the cable is unpredictable. I bought one, had it a year before it came undone. Bought anther one, it lasted, maybe 2 months."
2.0,This hat is great but I believe I got a defective one... after using for the first time I realized the Velcro strap the tightens the hat is sewn in upside down.  In order to tighten the hat to fit I have to twist the strap in order to Velcro properly. See pictures.<br />I would appreciate customer service contacting me in order to assist in correcting this issue.  Just purchased a few weeks ago.
2.0,"These are not capris, they are full length and a odd workout material over Cotton. I would not recommend these to anyone under 5”6"
2.0,This product did not fit me like I thought it would as it was smaller and a lot more baggy than expected. I like the style but wish the material was better.
2.0,It was pretty I’m color. The dress was crazy big. Had to return
2.0,This is supposed to be cut with the front higher than the back. It is not.
2.0,Broken within 2 months
2.0,Did not let see still to much glare
2.0,I like looking at it but the front part where the metal heart is is so straight and stiff that it pushes up against my throat and makes it hard to hear. The leather fabric is nice but the edges cut into my neck when i wear it. For me it doesnt work. But it's cute to look at.
2.0,"I got the 16g and there is no advertised picture of what it looks like. It's my fault for assuming the smallest size would look like the advertised picture, but it still would have been nice to see exactly what I was paying for. Be warned that if you buy the 16g, it is not quite shaped like the others. It's just a normal skinny horseshoe.<br />Furthermore, my ring was crooked and slightly bent. At least I got the rubber stoppers out of it, which was great until I had some sort of reaction to them. The area around the hole for the ring swelled up and was infected for a day or so after using them. Coincidence maybe, but it's odd that would happen right after using the rubber stoppers.<br />I'm not an irate customer at all, but I am very disappointed in this product."
2.0,For a child wrist not an adult
2.0,"The keychain portion of this product is very flimsy and is prone to coming apart. If you're using the construction helmet portion for another purpose like I did, you will find that it is a nice solid piece of plastic."
2.0,"These gloves got a tear the first tine I used them. I was very disappointed. I am still able to use them by wearing then gloves underneath, but that’s an extra step that I didn’t want."
2.0,"This ear ring look good, but it dropped on the floor and everything fell asper, tryed many times to set the stine back on but it never worked."
2.0,My wife is an asian and didn't fit her good.
2.0,I love Kancan jeans but nothing about these are “super skinny.” I have a pair of skinny kancan and needed a different size so bought these. These are baggy at the knees and not fitted all the way down the leg. Super disappointed in the fit. They don’t look polished in my opinion.
2.0,Not a drawstring as listed. Runs small. Very thin.
2.0,Very poor quality. I also ordered two sizes up and it was still too small.
2.0,"The pajama's are very pretty, the rose pattern is just what my daughter wanted.  But, they're a wrinkly mess.  I don't care about the bottoms, but unless you like to iron, I wouldn't suggest buying as the collar and facing fold out and look unfinished makin it difficult to find the bottom holes. The way the underside running down the buttons and button hole sides fold forward makes them look cheaply made."
2.0,Not as advertised. Was supposed to be low rise. And was way high. Plus really baggy and horrible fit
2.0,Broke after wearing it for the second time .
2.0,"I love the meshing on these. Very cool detail that exposes just the calves. It's really cute and looks great with a lot of outfits. These are much more high-waisted than I thought they'd be. It looks good with a cropped shirt or one that hides how high they are. It would be hard to wear something backless with these though.<br />They fit alright when I first put them on, a tid bit long in the leg but as the night went on I found myself having to keep pulling up my pants and the crotch kept getting lower and lower. I put them through the wash in hot water and dried them but it didn't help much. I didn't think they'd shrink but I thought I'd try anyways.<br />They're so cute I really want to wear them again but I'm not sure if I want to go through the struggle again!<br />I received this product in exchange for my honest opinion."
2.0,Very pretty but way too small ...i bought for 5-6 years old  for my 3 years old daughter and its still too small😱. I'm returning for larger size
2.0,Sleeve were too tight around my arms and the fabric was very staticy
2.0,Material is great but the pants is long - it is not cropped. I bought it for that reason so I am not really satisfied.
2.0,"Realmente tenía muchas expectativas con estas pijamas, me da mucha pena porque realmente en diseño y calidad son lindas hasta mejor que la foto, la razón por la que le doy 2 estrellas es porque no mencionan que la tela se encoge en la primera lavada. Tengo una hija de 10 años ella es delgada y un poco larga y le va muy bien siempre la talla 10-12 por eso le compre talla 12 , porque la talla 14 es demasiado grande aquí en mi país, que pena ahora ya no se que hacer con la pijama porque le queda a la mitad de la pantorrilla y no se ve bien, no le duró nada la pijama fue dinero desperdiciado, aconsejó comprar una talla más grande, porque es linda y de buena calidad"
2.0,"The image online is much better. I took them out of the case and immediately noticed scratches on the goggles, and especially one large white scratch.I must of received a return...."
2.0,pretty much see-through...
2.0,"Ordered a medium and they were literally falling off my hips (I wear about a 26).... I was NOT expecting that especially since almost everything I currently wear are mediums.... Cute design, but define order smaller if you do get them!!"
2.0,Is there an exchange policy? Bought the shoes for my daughter for her B Day and now one wont charge or light up
2.0,Did not expect the texture to feel and look like plastic
2.0,Not a good product I only worn it once
2.0,It is thick and soft- But it smells awe full.
2.0,Only wore a few times and pocket tore. Not very rugged or sturdy
2.0,Very pretty but within a few weeks the keyring change colors. The keyring got really ugly ...
2.0,The design is great. But.... Visibility is very poor indoor with ambient light. Trying to walk outside trick-or-treat at night is terrible even with flash light. I would imaging people purchase this to use at Halloween party; it just doesn't work.
2.0,Image of map was so blurry I couldn't even tell it was a map
2.0,"Out of 100 pieces I only got 14 that are usable.  There were Christmas, Valentine’s Day, summer, Christian, and more pirate charms than anything else.  Not worth the money."
2.0,"Well, finally got what it seam to be s bracelet. I don't know if there's a trick to it, but it does stay put it keeps coming off. Is a beautiful bracelet."
2.0,"I've never had a shirt be too short in the sleeves and overall until this one. Thats odd. It was also odd that the collar seam on the neck was off set to the side, up on the shoulder instead of at the back.<br /><br />Other than that it was pretty good actually."
2.0,Way smaller than described.
2.0,"Please don't  waste your money. This dress is so cheaply made, it looks like a costume.<br />I regret buying it."
2.0,It turned dark with in two weeks of daily use and the locks tend to fall apart when regularly changing !! Not that great for daily use ! It did not serve the purpose for what I bought for !
2.0,"I'm just really not impressed with this shirt. I didn't feel like it was THAT small per say. It just has a weird fit. I'm kind of narrow shouldered anyways so this shirt just shows too much shoulder. It makes me feel like I have to keep adjusting and shaping to make it look right. I don't like that. I like nice, attractive, hassle free items. I'm pretty disappointed with it. I ordered it for a meeting I have and o thought it would match my boots. Well, the brown in the picture is much lighter then in person. It looks dang near black once you get it."
2.0,"I can not believe I waited months for this thing. Everything was loose, the shaft of the tool is VERY loose in the bridge so it doesn't go in a straight line and can wobble everywhere, not exactly a good thing when you are pressing a hand on to a watch. The plastic ends still have ALL of the flashing on them from when they were molded, half had the holes half closed. I spent about an hour with a freaking exacto blade and some tiny drill bits in a pin vice to clean them up. I'm going to try to make a bushing for the top bridge to hold the shaft more tightly.<br />The plastic ends are not threaded, but the end of the shaft is. This means that every time you change sizes it's tilted one way or another and that means not pressing hands evenly which means stretched out holes in the hands. You can get it pretty straight and then keep rotating the shaft to try to even things out when you press, but there it is. You do that and because of the aforementioned looseness of the shaft you are not hitting the same spot every time anyway. There is so much play that you can literaly be on the exact center of the hand hole, lift it up, push it down, and end up not even touching the thing at all. It's that bad.<br /><br />Long and short of this is that this piece of garbage isn't worth even a tenth of what I paid for it. The problems with it totally negate what would appear to be the obvious advantage this would have over a standard hand held pusher: precision. Looseness, and a bridge in the way means you have a tougher time getting it to work than a hand held.<br /><br />If you think this will perform like a Stella Euro (what it looks like) think again. Go to esslinger.com and buy that one. If you think it even resembles a horotech, guess again. I mean I thought since they were good at replicating quality products in the country of origin of this one that they might get close. Nope."
2.0,This fit very awkward. I ended up not wearing it because the top didn't feel secure. It felt like my boobs would fall out of the bottom with any sudden movement. I was disappointed that I couldn't wear it without worrying about the top because it looks really cute!
2.0,Nice dress but come with no belt and too small according to your size chart.
2.0,can see the seam...somewhat cheesy looking
2.0,This had such an awkward fit on me. It is lined so it was very tight around my butt and The lining was not stretchy.
2.0,"Started falling apart almost immediately. Thankfully I was able to return it without too much headache, but unless I got a botched pair, they're not very well made. ;?"
2.0,"Just got this in and the lobster clasp was broken. If you don't have spare lobster clasps to replace it, I wouldn't bother getting it. The overall look of it is exactly what I wanted so I am happy with it. Of course after I did some repairs to it"
2.0,"Edit: almost immediately after I submitted this review the clasp broke on one of the earrings.  I guess I spoke too soon.  Sigh...<br /><br />These are lovely silver hoops with an interesting style. The clasps are easy to open yet stay closed strongly. It came in a nice, pretty box. I'm certain these will be my go to for daily wear."
2.0,"The gold tone part feels like cheap plastic. I wanted a nice long tassel necklace, but this looks so cheap, I won't wear it. Will give to granddaughter to play with."
2.0,This was far too small on me. I looked like a stuffed sausage.  The material is more cotton like than I expected and the skirt is an elastic waist.  If you are very fit and looking for a outfit to wear out to a club this might be good for you.
2.0,"Fits more like spandex than any other materials. I ordered the green color and it was a lot lighter in person than the image shows. Very cute but did not fit me. I returned and the process was easy. I recommend ordering up 2 sizes, at least."
2.0,"Needs better construction at the heel. These shoes have clear bra strap things to close the shoe at the heel. This does not work well. I will have to alter them and ad cloth for it to be a whole part ad close properly and fit securely.  As is, The shoes are not secure to the feet. This needs to be a whole part. Not closed with straps"
2.0,way smaller than u think
2.0,"I thought the top would look like a romantic top.  The print is unremarkable in person.  Looks better in the picture.  To me, the top would look much better if the v-neck was not as low and the top was longer.  On the upside, I love the way the sleeves are made."
2.0,"I'm a combat veteran who wanted a new hat for Memorial Day and got caught up in the moment. This is a 6 panel hat made with very light material compared to other hats I own. The 2-star rating is because the ornamentation (don't know how to spell embroidery) is good. The sweat band is rather flimsy. The brim, aka visor, has two rows of stitching to hold the material in place which is the least amount of visor stitching on any hat I have ever owned. Bottom line is this is not an everyday hat and had I seen and examined this hat in a brick and mortar store I would not have bought it for the price I paid."
2.0,"Pros:  great coloring<br /><br />Cons: flimsy, it unlatches on the sides as pulling out of pocket, or using phone."
2.0,Drop it for the first time and it broke lol def not for long term protection
2.0,Way too small!! Not alot of give. Nice material though.
2.0,The picture looks way better than in person. It's cute but much thinner than the picture. If you have tiny wrist and thin arms this bracelet could work.
2.0,"These shirts are cut weird, loose on the chest but tight on the gut. The exact opposite effect I was hoping for."
2.0,"Looked like a great value, but made poorly. Ties came off quickly."
2.0,Glasses not polarized as advertised.
2.0,"One side of the dress the lines don't line up. I wasn't really sure if it was the back or front as there was no tag. I normally wear a L or XL in dresses, because I'm a 36DDD I'm always worried about the fit in the chest area. I bought an XL and it was tight across my chest. I would definitely need a slip under this dress if I were keeping it."
2.0,Dot Not Stretch Runing Small
2.0,"I'm not giving these a 5 star since they do not match the picture. There is no string from the flower leading to the ankle. It looks like a bracelet with a flower in my opinion. Only reason I'm not giving it a 1 is because I like the color of the flowers and the seller was nice.<br /><br />I received this product at a discount; however, this does not influence my review. I only write honest reviews regardless of whether I purchased a product at full price, at a discount, or received it free. Hope this helps! 😁"
2.0,"I bought these 1 month ago to go hiking and swimming in North Carolina. The Velcro is shredding and coming off of the shoe already. They were comfortable and worked well while on our trip, but it sucks that the Velcro doesn't last long at all..."
2.0,"It came misshapen because of packing, so it doesn't really look like a pith helmet."
2.0,Started off small and ended up child size after one wash. Had to give them all away.
2.0,F came off had to re purchase a new f and so far second one still intact
2.0,Nice material nice blouse. Little small on the arms. Its more for thin arms made. People with more skin on the arms will not like it.
2.0,I like it but it’s to big for the purse I got
2.0,"Glasses run huge, I couldn't get them to stay on my face at all. The coloring of the pink also gave me horrible double vision."
2.0,Didn't like it at all and had returned it.
2.0,Definitely size up- and cup didn't work For DDD
2.0,"The backs for these earrings are super disappointing. As someone who loves statement earrings/jewelry, I was truly looking forward to these. They have incredible colors, are lightweight, but I’ve had them fall out time and time again due to the backs. I’ve lost three backs already and I’ve had them for just a few weeks."
2.0,The hat had to work because I bought it last minute.  But there is no way to adjust the size to fit.  I had to cut a slit in it for it to fit my son’s head. The hat looks like something your child will make in school.
2.0,Better but a extra large if your a small. After 1st wash fit my 5 year old without drying it
2.0,The straps did not fit in my daughters Miraflex glasses.
2.0,"Nice-looking stick-on earrings; however, the package says &#34;144 pc&#34; but the ad here and the sticker on the back of the package say &#34;288 pc.&#34; I will be returning this item."
2.0,Strings detaching already poorly made.
2.0,They run very small. The 2T is very tight  18 month old .
2.0,"Actually, they are not likely to be mistaken for high-quality costume jewelry.  I sent them back because they were dull looking, and seemed like something you might see at a dime-store.  Not what I expected, and not as they looked in the photo.  Perhaps I just got a bad pair, but I would not wear these."
2.0,Not what was shown nor described!
2.0,Runs really small! Gave them to a very young girl!
2.0,Was easy and convenient for putting on and removal but the edges bent up and actually cut my palm a bit and was super uncomfortable to wear
2.0,"The shirt was cute, but the front has almost a felt feel.  It pilled after washing and where my arms rub the sides, there are more pills/balls of material.  I'm disappointed."
2.0,"The sizing is off, at least on the largest size. I measured before ordering. It fits so loose I just cannot wear it."
2.0,I got this at a massive discount and it's still barely worth the money. This belt is very cheaply made with terrible dye and very basic leather. I'd definitely return it if I paid more.
2.0,The fan is in the back and doesn't support the neck which is pretty thin.  We spent a lot of time  trying to hang the neck with strings or stuff something into it to hold it up with no luck.  We got a few different costumes - recommend you choose one with a fat neck.  Unfortunately I waited too long to take it out of the package and I can't return it now.
2.0,The sizing is off and these do not  work like 20-30 mmHG
2.0,"Good lenght, warm and not too bulky.<br />Its not true to size.<br /><br />Jacket is shedding feathers like crazy."
2.0,Loved it until the clasp broke after two days of casual wear. Dont waste your money. Unless you're fine with paying for repairs.
2.0,Zipper stuck & wouldn't go all of the way up. Material is stiff & doesn't flow - sticks to hips & thighs.
2.0,"As soon as I put them on,the button came off in my hand.  WTH?????  So disappointed, the fabric was great,,the fit was nice,but couldn't close them."
2.0,Strap fell apart shortly after I started using it.  You get what you pay for..
2.0,"9-10 was more like a 7-8.  I removed the tags and took it on vacation, not knowing it woulf be too small.  too late to return"
2.0,Got for grandson It was ok but looked cheap and didn't last long
2.0,the size is smaller than standard and the quality of the product is not very good
2.0,Spring was missing however I guess it would have been perfect comfort unknown couldn’t wear it due to spring missing on one side want another but scared to purchase again don’t want the same headache
2.0,"I love this  style of this bag the Faith. I have it in two colors, I just didn't like the moonscape color."
2.0,"I like the fit, the inside fabric is soft. It has a nice large hood. But the wind and I mean a slight breeze goes right through it. It’s a good coat for<br />Chilly nights to go check the barn. But not for anything outdoors. Soft and comfortable."
2.0,"The fit is really weird on this one. Too bulky overall and too tight at the bust area and armhole making it uncomfortable to move your arms. The fabric is cheap polyester. The lace is sewn very poorly and the overall dress does not look anything like the one shown in the picture. I wanted to like this cause it looked awesome in Navy with white lace, but was very disappointed. also too long. Had to return this."
2.0,Package delivered incomplete. Missing headband.
2.0,Didn’t like the material but over all construction of the skirt was good
2.0,Not comfortable. Did not like seam in front of cups.
2.0,"It's stiff, not soft - but other than that ok.  Will not be my favorite because I like soft!"
2.0,Poor stitch quaility.  Shorts are cheap fabric
2.0,Broke as soon as we got them. Look holding charm broke on both chains.
2.0,"Dislike the clasp. It’s very attractive ,"
2.0,It looked like a paper bag on me.  Just didn’t fit my shape very well.  I returned it.
2.0,"I hate the cheap, nylon material. I couldn’t even wear it. Useless purchase"
2.0,Clasp ends turned into my ear. Had to cut it out.
2.0,"I just got my Baleaf Men's swimming trunk (blue with stripes).  I bought the large because of the reviews I read, I would usually wear a medium.  The large proved to be more like a very tiny.  There is no way I could wear this thing on a public beach.  the pictures here are extremely misleading. The thing is just about 6 inches from the top of the waste to the hem.  I got some booty so the back hem was pulled up and was so unflattering. I would wish to return it. I could have been 2.5 inches longer.  Seems they ran out of material. This certainly not a lg trunk."
2.0,Too large for female faces.  will not stay on
2.0,The watch has the same basic features as in the online pics.  However watch  is light weight and less sturdy  than expected.
2.0,These earrings are cute but not very good quality.  They are big and almost too bulky.  They aren't as pretty as the picture either.  The ones I received looked dirty and tarnished.  Too bad.
2.0,"These sunglasses are mirrored on both sides, making it difficult to wear while driving."
2.0,I like the product except that they do not have the open fly as advertised.  I bought this particular item for that reason.
2.0,Thought is was longer according to photo on Amazon
2.0,"Very cute, but they do not stay closed. This is a must with a very active 7 year old. I was constantly clipping them back together and she eventually lost one."
2.0,5’10” / 150lbs / usually a size 6-8 / ordered a large<br /><br />Thin and rough material so not very flattering on. Color is nice though.
2.0,Good material but does not fit. I got a large and it was too long yet too tight. I normally can wear mediums I just prefer large but this does not fit
2.0,This seems really different from other Vera Bradleys. It's stiff and my phone won't fit in the side pockets.
2.0,The bottom of the t-shirt keeps rolling up.  Once I washed it it shrunk a little.
2.0,"Lesson here is I should of read the reviews before buying. 5 shorts arrived within 2 days, great. 2 of the 5 fit as ordered. 2 were way to large. 1 was way too short in the crouch. So only two of five fit. I returned them."
2.0,Too small my 4 year old wears an 8 and a 9 she couldn’t get her foot I
2.0,The print looks different from the website. I like it but can not use it for the purposes I brought it for.
2.0,This doesn't look good at all as a strapless.  I'm a 34d but I ordered the 34c n the cups were way too big.  It covered the sides but here's a huge gap in the top. The looks okay with the straps though.
2.0,"The quality and design of this shirt is good, but it was much too long on my 5'3"" frame. Would be better on a tall person."
2.0,Could not  get them on with help extremely tight
2.0,runs small... was tight and super short in the sleeves<br />cute shirt but not the greatest quality
2.0,band broke still have the watch part
2.0,"Looks good on wrist, but clasp broke after 2 days."
2.0,This leg warmers are falling apart.
2.0,It was just one piece not two pieces
2.0,"Stretchy leather implies low structural integrity. This belt looks great, but once you have it in your hands it feels like rubber."
2.0,These shirts are too short.  Does not cover belly at all.  Even worse after washing.  I even ordered a bigger size then i wear hoping for it to be longer.  Nope.  Still too short.  So i just wear it as a sleep shirt.
2.0,I returned it. It was too small.
2.0,"Cute, but the antlers lean forward. This makes the headband constantly fall off my daughter's head."
2.0,It's a cheap piece of work.
2.0,"These are significantly smaller,  shorter,  less soft than others I've purchased.  I recommend sizing up. The fabric has a glossy sheen to it and does not soften with washing. If you are using under dresses there are softer alternatives."
2.0,This white top is very see-through even when your not wet!
2.0,For children only.
2.0,"Cheap material. Design concept nice, however need better material."
2.0,Seemed smaller then a 14.
2.0,At least a size too big
2.0,"I'm not a large person, 5'5&#34; 117# but there was no way I could even get this on. Might work for a child. I ordered the Medium as it was reported to run small."
2.0,"This hoop is really pretty rose gold with pretty accents.  I was really excited to wear it.  The hinge makes it really easy to open and put on.  Within the first hour it opened and fell out.  I thought maybe I didn't click it together or something. I put it back in and made sure it was closed properly, and that was the last time I saw it.  At some point it fell out never to be seen again.  I have had other ones of similar design but have never had one fall out like this before.  I don't know if the closure is just to loose or something else is going on but I am sad it didn't stay closed and sad it is lost forever."
2.0,Cute but not worth $10. Waste of money. Just simply lights up when you squeeze it. It looks like something you would buy on wish.com or some other 3rd party Chinese website.
2.0,"I am 5'8 d chest always med. this has legs that are way to long for any flat shoe. It is very thin, so wrinkles in the closet. The trunk is short, I have not washed it, I don't want to spend the time to iron it, besides it is so thin, I do not think it will last one wash, the little scallop at the top is a pain because I needed to keep adjusting this to not trip over (in heels) yet sorry but with that short trunk, who wants to see your &#34;details&#34; wish I could send it back, but I wore it to dinner before going home to change."
2.0,Is not athletic fit and collar is flimsy.<br />Very inexpensive for a reason 😕
2.0,They will kinda pinch the earlobe but overall they are fine for general wear
2.0,"Firstly, I ordered xl and the packaging labels it as such but the actual sweaters tag says it’s a large. The size is Junior’s basic and not women oversized. I’m 5”5 162 lbs and large fits me with room to spare but this one fits short at the sleeves and my bellybutton shows when arms are lifted because it must be a junior size not women."
2.0,"Sticky is awesome and easy to remove.<br />Fit is horrible, wants to fill in center, no lift.<br />Wish I had checked it out earlier so I could return it but to late now."
2.0,Very curvey.  More than expected.
2.0,The extra large fits small
2.0,"The top runs very small and the pants run very large. If you are big busted, i am a 44D, this will not fit well"
2.0,The material is regular. The fabric is very thin
2.0,Disappointed. The clip broke the first time I wore it.
2.0,The catch for the rhinestones separated and I couldn't put it back together.  I didn't even have a chance to wear the necklace.
2.0,"Quality just ok, shipping takes FOREVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2.0,"I actually like this dress. It runs a bit small and I never run it threw the dryer. I line dry it.  It does have a slip with it which is a good thing because fabric is very thin.<br />The only reason I am giving it 2 stars, and that’s being generous considering that they are lying about the fabric. It is polyester blended. I am very sensitive to polyester. I know right away when I put it on. Plus if you sweat-in polyester, it gets a real funky locker room smell to it.<br />So if ultimately don’t mind polyester, then it is a nice casual dress to wear around the house. Pockets would have been nice too. I just don’t understand why a lot if these cheaper sellers lye about the fabric or just don’t tell you what it is. This is the only one that I ended up keeping.<br />I bought the Large in Red. And it is a big snug. I should not have to wear an X Large. I am not that broad."
2.0,"Although they fit well, I feel like there is no support holding them up well, so they slide down easily when walking."
2.0,"I thought it would be a cute tie dye style dress.  The colors, however, take up little of the dress and so most of it is white.  Despite being fairly heavy fabric (which is rather nice) it's white, so pretty see through.  I would have to wear something under it.  It's the silky fabric, though, that disappoints me.  It feels like cheap silk sheets.  It's pretty odd feeling and makes it much more like a nightgown than a casual dress.  I didn't return it.  I'll just wear it as a house dress, but I'm bummed that it isn't appropriate to wear out."
2.0,"I am disappointed in the quality, the interior is very cheap nylon, I have had it about 3 weeks time but only used it for maybe half that and the interior pockets are completely falling apart, they are detaching from the purse, its horrible. I am extremely unhappy with this product for what I paid for it. I am really disappointed overall"
2.0,"I was looking for a good Light weight pair for work as I work in a hot factory! I ordered a large and I normally wear a medium to large in stretch pants 8 women or 12-14 in juniors and I’m 5’2. Yeah they swallowed me hole! I felt like wearing men’s long shorts! The material is thin which is great for what I needed as I didn’t want anything tight and thick! But so I wouldn’t have a total loss bc of the price I spent, I have to roll them up 2 times for them to go to my knee or right above and for them not to fall off! As for it not to look ridiculous When there rolled up I have to wear a big shirt!  I’m just really disappointed for the price! I would have just been better off buying men’s basketball shorts instead"
2.0,This isn't a good gaiter. It looks awful and it falls down. I bought it for running and it is ineffective.
2.0,For a small child only. 3 and under.
2.0,The shoes look great but its a bit heavy for my kids to wear. The size came smaller so we suggest anyone to buy a bigger size than your average.
2.0,If you are expecting a nice BRIGHT WHITE like pictured DON’T BUY THIS!  It’s a dirty grayish white & Very thin.  Disappointed (see pic- my BRIGHT WHITE denim jacket on the left and this thin crappy grayish white tank on the right.
2.0,"Im actually really sad for my order. It seems like the ring was bent in production, so the dipper just looks like a wavy line. You cannot tell what it is at all. Im still wearing it because it is dainty and pretty, but Im really upset that it looks nothing like what I ordered."
2.0,Poor quality. Literally wore it twice and the sleeve material came out of the cuff and began to fray.
2.0,"I found this to be too large to be truly wearable. The workmanship is good and the colors are pretty. But, now I need to decide what I can put it on, not on me, though."
2.0,Its cute but looks bigger than it is. Its good for phone  and maybe paperback book for beach. Not very much room to carry much.
2.0,"I bought these for my nose. The variety was great, but the bar is way too long and it looks silly. I’m disappointed because I was so excited!"
2.0,just didnt look flattering on me. but a cute top
2.0,Very thin Pockets suck
2.0,This was really cute except for the fact that it does not fit as expected. It fits perfectly except the lace at the bottom of the shorts are super tight and you can’t really try stretching it without ripping the material.
2.0,Cute sandals but way too wide and big.
2.0,Hat cute but ackward. Bill on the hat too small and flemsy
2.0,"Was sent directly as a gift. Purchased as it indicated Genuine Leather. At first gifted person didn't want to say anything. Now found out that it is not leather and very heavy. Well boxed, good presentation & good for the price. Would not have purchased. Contacted the seller, seems they are not interested."
2.0,"Están comodos pero a los 10 min de ponérmelos ya se hicieron bolitas del roce y en la primera lavada se agrietaron las letras y el caballo , la verdad que la calidad no es muy buena eso si son calentitos por lo menos para estar por casa ."
2.0,Main button doesn't close easily
2.0,Always falls off the watch
2.0,"It is fleece lined and fabric is thick and probably good for cold weather, but while it is loose around the body (as it is supposed to be), it is tight around arms and neck (the most slender parts of my body, ironically). I did not size up because I do not see a point in wearing too loose something that is fleece lined. Decide accordingly!"
2.0,"I see through, very clear."
2.0,Way too short. Does not fit like a tunic top at all.
2.0,The unicorns were very pretty in color unfortunately the bracelet broke as well as the necklace broke  in the first hour she wore it very disappointed.
2.0,"These have been tried and true for years, but recently it seems they have switched up the fabric to a sweat wicking fabric.  In doing so they changed the cut in the pattern so they fit off and the material is not as comfortable.<br /><br />The previous pairs had poor stitching in the crotch so they opened up leaving your balls to hang out and get caught in them when you sit down.<br /><br />I really hate when companies mess with a classic and get it wrong."
2.0,I wanted the bracelet with all the colors like in the picture and I got most of them green<br />The quality is great
2.0,Not for Tall Women.  Waist too high
2.0,"Suelo usar talla L pero esa está muy muy pequeña , Lastima, no porque si está hermoso"
2.0,Pretty but who buys a watch that doesn't work? How frustrating! I don't have a readily available watch fixer so that proves to be a significant inconvenience. When I purchase a new watch I expect it to work at least initially! And it was too complicated to change myself with a watch kit.
2.0,"Very pretty fresh out the box, but quickly began to turn despite my best efforts and the seller's claim. The stones are very cloudy, making the ring look super-fake. I started returning it, but did not complete the form before the return cutoff of 02/04/2017 (blame my ADHD)."
2.0,the photo is misleading. there is no slouch or drape. this hat actually feels tight.
2.0,"This looks so cool. What a great Halloween costume, but now that i have it, it is WAY TOO SMALL. When i where a shirt... A large is slighly tight, and XL is slightly too big. An XL of this cloak does not even touch in the middle. I will have to find a different costume, or not participate in the company party."
2.0,It looks nice but it's not wide enough to fill the watch's sides
2.0,"The cap looks great, but upon fitting, it looks like more of an oversized novelty hat. Which is okay for some people. More for people with lots of thick hair."
2.0,"Nice, light, silk balaclava.  It came free with an order of Bohn body armor.<br /><br />Unfortunately, it has a seam up the middle of the front which is really annoying.  Better than as nothing but not much.<br /><br />Your Dad was right when he taught you that you get what you pay for!"
2.0,"Cheaply made. Seams started fraying and coming open, clasps bent under weight of a couple textbooks. Don't get it if you're planning on carrying anything heavy in it"
2.0,These shoes shrunk in size when left out in sun
2.0,It sticks way to off my finger was not expected when I ordered it bc the pics don't show the actually size it's VERY bulky
2.0,"Had I received both hair clips, I probably would have left five stars. However, only one arrived in the package sent to me. The one that I'd gotten was the white one; it's adorable, surprisingly incredibly soft, and well made."
2.0,Bought to go with my dress as a bridesmaid in a wedding really good deal for the whole set. Had it on maybe 2 hours at most turned my skin black under the jewelry.  Very cheap! The quality matches the price I guess
2.0,"Description says girl's 2XL, but the sizing info on listing uses women's sizing (2XL = 20/22). This is not accurate, it is much slimmer than a women's 20/22 would be. this is DEFINITELY girls 2XL,<br /><br />I returned the item."
2.0,"Cute earring.  However I've only had them since May 29th and one has broken.  The little clasp that connects the earring to to little thing that goes on your ear has broken on one of the earrings. These are extremely flimsy little earrings.  Today, October 19th I called Amazon and they called Spunky and Spunky will not send me new earrings!!!  Amazon however has rectified things by offering a credit or refund.  I'm presently awaiting the credit so that I can repurchase these. I hope to get a new pair that maybe lasts this time.  Due to what has happened I cannot give these a good recommendation.  I think that Spunky should have replaced these.  When you look at the price, these are not cheap earrings either.  Beware these very flimsy earrings."
2.0,"I bought this, taking a chance, for the wide beige elastic, but did not like the quality of elastic."
2.0,"Nice looking.fits well, but doesn’t sync with Fitbit. So, basically it is only a watch."
2.0,These earrings are so dainty and pretty. I was excited to see that they were small hoops that hug the earlobe. They look more expensive than they are. The downside is I won't be able to wear them because one earring doesn't latch shut so it is useless. The other fits snugly in the back of the earring and closes shut. The other doesn't close in the back with the post. So disappointing!
2.0,This was a beautiful bathing suit but unfortunately it runs really small!  I am 5'8 weigh 138lbs  and unfortunately the extra-large was very small .  Sadly I had to return it
2.0,looks nice but really cheaply made.
2.0,"the material on this suit was way too thin and see through even thought the suit was black, you could still see through it! But super cute and confortable!"
2.0,This purse didn't even last three months. I went to put the strap on my shoulder and it broke !!! Really Not buying again. I thought the material would last but it didn't.
2.0,Ordered the 12 1/2 and found them to run small since my foot is 12 1/2(size 47 stamped inside) and it didnt fit.<br />So I ordered the next size up which was 13 1/2(size 48 stamped inside) and it seems like its the same size as the 12 1/2.<br />Had to return both since both seemed to be no different and the same size too small.<br />You would think ordering the next size up would make a difference but it was still too small.<br />It seemed comfortable in the sole but the shoe was confining because of it running smaller than normal.<br />BTW....made in China. Maybe that had something to do with it. They may not wear anything above size 8.
2.0,"I'm 5'4"" and tend to wear a size small/28.  I couldn't get the pants zipped completely closed because the waist was too small. (I ordered a size small).  The fabric has a clingy characteristic, so rather than being a flowing wide legged pant, the hug my hips and legs in an unflattering way."
2.0,"Really pretty set, got so many compliments. However, the jewel has already fell off one of the charms."
2.0,This was a waste of money.
2.0,"Two complaints for these socks: One, they are very thin (can see through when held to light) not like the photo that makes them look like thick cotton socks.<br />Second, they cover more of the foot than the photo shows. These almost come up to the bend on the ankle, rather than half-way down as the photo implies. Cannot wear with my slip-on sneakers or converses without the sock showing significantly.<br />The only thing I am happy with is the silicon pad on the heel to prevent sliding down.<br />Will be returning. (Ordered 6-10 and I wear size 8)"
2.0,Cheap Cheap Cheap... They squeek and the lenses are not perfect. I don't know about the video in the previews reviews. I must have gotten a much cheaper set.
2.0,"Buckle will shred this belt. Also, this buckle pictured is not what was sent. Similar. But not the same."
2.0,Frayed then broke after 2 months
2.0,Crotch was weird on the pants.
2.0,These discolored within a few times wearing...no longer gold. :(
2.0,"It's fit too snugly to my face, except every time I take it off the tip of the handle kept poking into my eyes all the time, no matter how I take it off, keep poking my eye, and I just had eyes surgery done....need to return it back."
2.0,The dress is very sheer and the fit is not flattering at all it had no shape.
2.0,material is see through. very cheaply made
2.0,"Ordered these socks the first time in October 2018. Very comfortable and soft but started to wear in the toes and heels within a year or so. Gradually had to throw them away, pair by pair.<br />Thought we'd give them another try and reordered this past June 2020. Two pairs already have holes in them, in various places. Wondering if Polo changed manufacturers.  Won't order again."
2.0,"Real cute earrings, wore them maybe 3 or 4 times since I had them and they are already turning colors. From silver to that brassy color 😔"
2.0,fit small. was see-through. came with seem ripped and visible holes.
2.0,"Threads on straps frayed after very first wash.<br />The dress itself is lovely, the design and color is gorgeous, the material is nice but the straps with threads makes it look so cheap."
2.0,It was so small that I can't where it at all & im not a big person & I got a 2X
2.0,The fit is strange. The sides are very wide and the bottom is short while the arms are very long and baggy. Cloth is also very thin and transparent.
2.0,"I was looking for reading glasses that would let me see my phone (mounted just below my windshield and acting as a GPS) while I'm driving. These, like other progressive readers, should have done that. And, like the other progressive readers I've tried, failed miserably.<br /><br />The reading part was fine. The problem was with the upper half. Everything seen through it is distorted. Worse is that everything seen through the upper part of the lens starts shifting when you move your head. The nausea-inducing result is not what you want when driving a car."
2.0,I thought it was a thinner jacket it’s def a winter coat
2.0,I got the plus size pair.  I'm 6 2 and 215lbs.  They're plenty long but very snug.
2.0,Watch is too small for the time to be visible. Light does not work right. I have to order a different watch
2.0,"Not sure if I like it yet, the card pockets seem to tight and small, I could ony get a couple of cards in ea pocket. A bit disappointed you may get it back."
2.0,Does not look as good in person.
2.0,This is not a sweater like shown in the picture. It is a thin shirt that runs about a size too small. Order two sizes up if you would like it to look like the picture.
2.0,"pretty, but the gems fall off in spots and leave weird looking black holes that make the earrings look dirty, didn't last long"
2.0,"Being the owner of several quality HD shirts, I was overall disappointed with this shirt. The material feels cheap and as others stated the print on it mirrors the poor quality of the fabric."
2.0,"After only wearing to the gym to spin/weight-lift a couple of times one the shirt developed ""pulls"" which look terrible.  While at this price point I do not expect it to last forever - clearly should have lasted longer than that before it started to show wear and tear"
2.0,Beautiful. But the post broke.
2.0,These were very cute but one of the bows fell off the first time I wore them.
2.0,"Flowers and unicorn design is glued on , not seen on, so it was placed in the dryer and the flowers fell off and the heat stained the dress. I had to go am see the designs so they won't fall off again"
2.0,Two gems fell out before arriving at my house. They feel very cheaply made. Not surprising but still.
2.0,The dress was cute but even just looking in the mirror it looked super cheaply made. Returned it.
2.0,"Nice looking glasses but they're heavy, uncomfortable, and constantly slide down my nose."
2.0,"The finish is nice on these huggie hoops, but they're way too difficult to open.  One set was extremely hard to get open (someone with long nails would not have been able to) and one other set, one of the pieces would not open at all.  I was sad to have to return these as the finish was lovely and, although on the small side, still looked very pretty."
2.0,"I was a bit disappointed that the stones were not a beautiful translucent blue as pictured but closer to opaque unless it is held up to a very bright light held from behind [unlikely when worn on the wrist.]  They almost appear black.  I'm also not sure if the stones are natural or artificially created, especially since there is absolutely no documentation accompanying the bracelet.  Finally, when looking closely, the facets are roughly finished with some bearing what appear to be kerf marks that were not polished out.  I guess I'd say you get what you pay for but, I thought I had paid enough to get something a little higher quality."
2.0,Bra is fitted fine but straps are thick and bulky. Side bands have thick wire that pokes your armpit. Color is great and looks beautiful but is not comfortable.
2.0,Medium Size is for children
2.0,The mask kept sliding off the nose despite the size being right. So I contacted the seller. But they stopped replying after one email. No resolution reached. So poor service and poor material. Dissatisfied
2.0,"Received this yesterday and it already had 3 ""diamonds"" missing. It's pretty but you can tell it's very cheaply made."
2.0,"I purchased my size according to the chart but it was still to small, beautiful in color and great design."
2.0,You get what you pay for.  These glasses are good looking but very cheaply made.
2.0,"I bought the 10-pack of the cacti print. The print itself is cute, the functionality is awesome in which you can clip it to anything, but I had to remove some stars from my review because the cacti pattern is not upright on the front of the holder; only on the back. The product photos showed the cacti pattern upright on the front of the holder which is misleading. Might not bother the average person but I planned on giving these as gifts, and had I known all the cacti were upside-down on the front I would've chosen a pattern where the upright position didn't matter- like zig-zags or tye-dye pattern. Disappointed."
2.0,Just received the wallet yesterday and the quality of it seems ok. The size of it is larger than what was expected and will not fit comfortable in front pocket (7 bills and all slots with one card each). I requestd a refund back because of this. Also just beware the company will be charging you a fee for return. So if take a chance on this wallet be sure that it fits your needs or else be paying for a return fee.
2.0,"Material is very thin and stitching seems sloppy, I can't see this shirt lasting more than a few wears before it falls apart. A shame being that the shirt is very nice looking."
2.0,The nose pad fell off after 2 days
2.0,Very soft and comfortable but print on top was more orange than red.  Disappointed
2.0,"It came apart the second time I wore it, the little rubber thing that attaches to the glasses came off."
2.0,Very rough feeling fabric
2.0,Looks very nice. Watch band stretches after a while and band doesn’t fit correctly. Therefore the watch moves and shuts off if it’s not flat on your arm.
2.0,I recieved this product with almost all of the spikes already broken on it. WHILE IT WAS STILL IN THE PLASTIC BAG IT COMES IN. I'm highly disappointed and glad it wasn't a whole lot. Though I still requested a refund. Never purchasing these again. An neither should you unless you plan on using them for one day.
2.0,I returned the bracelets as I did not like them when I received them. I could not read what the disc said and the paw looked different from what I saw on line. Sorry but sent them back and got something else.
2.0,"I wanted to like this dress, but it ended up being much too large through the chest and shoulders (and I'm not a small busted person). I will have to alter it to make it wearable, and that is just not worth it, for such an inexpensive dress."
2.0,Once the eboot is stretch there is no more use for it :(
2.0,I would have given it 5 stars if the seams weren’t already broken in the front pocket. Fits as expected and the material is nice.
2.0,Looks good but the mask came in broken. Super disappointed because I was excited about it.
2.0,The progression is poorly designed in the glasses I have worn progressive lenses before and I know how they work. These do not differentiate when you are looking down or up it is a blurry transition. Spend the extra money and get the other pairs advertised. It is definitely worth the wait.
2.0,The key Turnish but the rest if the bracelet is ok.<br />I guess.
2.0,Watch looks pretty cool but is small.  Looks like a woman's watch. Band is thinner then expected.  Spend the extra money and get a watch you know you will like
2.0,"They weren't made very well. Some straps have extra fabric hanging off. Each one fits a little differently. The padding is sewn together down the middle, so if you a are ""blessed"" it a actually squishes you into your arm pits. Wouldn't buy again, but cheap enough to wear anyway."
2.0,Should have chosen a different color.  The grey is a bit drab.  Fit was fine but man is the material ever thin.  I'll keep it but won't be purchasing again.
2.0,"the lace is actually kind of nice, i was worried it might be itchy but it hasnt been. i think the cups are just a little bit too big for me, but i kinda guessed on the size because i havent worn anything but sports bras in a long time. im not sure if the underwire is something thatll get more comfortable with time like how corsets mold to your body the more you wear them, but for now i cant wear these for very long because its painful."
2.0,Necklace is cute but very cheap quality
2.0,"This review is only for the sizing. The item itself was cute but unfortunately too big. I bought this for my 4 year old. The description says it fits ages 3-8. That’s a big gap but figured maybe it was stretchy. I have 3 girls within that age group, it was too big on all 3 of them. This is definitely one for a size 8 and up or a huskier kiddo. Had to return."
2.0,The dress came in too big and the material was pretty different from the photo and ot was very thin almost see-through.
2.0,The size I ordered was 2x the sweater was way too tight across the chest and I had to send it back. It did not meet my needs.
2.0,I returned the stockings because I could barely get my foot in with out getting caught in threads.  Didn't want to deal with this-
2.0,Poorer quality than I was expecting.  Would not buy again.
2.0,I could have made this myself with some horns and glue
2.0,The dress should be made with thicker and better fabric.
2.0,glasses are actually very small.
2.0,This top did not sit right on my arms and was often loose. The sleeves were also long for me.
2.0,"Extremely Small Cups. I ordered the 38 band hoping for a large cup. The cups were tiny, about a small B cup. Although the bra was beautiful the tiny cups made it unwearable."
2.0,"I honestly had higher expectations for this dress but it did not work out at all. The material of the dress was much heavier then expected, the fabric was not breathable at all.<br /><br />The cut was also awkward. The ""v"" of the dress was huge and there was no extra clasp to close it. But the waist was almost too tight. It did not look good at all and if I had seen it in the store I wouldn't have purchased it.<br /><br />I did return the dress and was disappointed in the customer service and return policy. Just an FYI to anyone considering buying, although it states there's a full return policy it is at the buyers expense. This was not clearly labeled on the listing so I was annoyed when I had to pay to ship the dress back, especially because it was due to the awkwardness if the dress cut.<br /><br />I would not recommend."
2.0,The zipper is cheap broke and sizes run small
2.0,This product was not at all what the picture looked like. The bra had 2 open slits in the cups as though there was padding removed.
2.0,Very disappointed. I had purchased this bag for a trip to london. The inside pocket had a hole that my keys to my suitcase lock fell through. I spent a half hour trying to get them out of the bottom of the bag. Within the first week of use the bag started falling apart.
2.0,"Not as pictured; when these arrived they literally looked clear. I showed them to a co-worker and she agreed... When I contacted the company they told me I was sent the correct ones. What? How do they look NOTHING like the picture? I can see maybe a few cracks that give off a LIGHT blue hue in the right light but by NO means are they as blue as presented ((See pictures)). I was headed out of town for a trip and NEEDED to keep these plugs and they do fit well, otherwise they would have been returned. Beautiful idea, just definitely not blue as shown."
2.0,not as good as the one i got from sportsman guide years ago didn't fit the same and didn't seem as insulated
2.0,The neck hole is way too big.  I should have sent it back.  Not recommended.
2.0,The cap is very tiny and be lost fast! Sometimes the ball feels like it will go through my earring hole.
2.0,"I am US size 14 with 42D top. I checked the size chart and chose xxl to accommodate top…knowing bottoms might be too big. Usually I have to order separates s it’s difficult to order a set and have both top n bottom fit..and this was no exception. Specifically in this case7, the bottoms fit fine BUT are in NO way “ high waisted” as advertised. More hipster /string bikini like. And the top? Well…no way I’d wear in public😂. Barely covers half IF that! Not even close to D cup. More like A/B.<br />I doubt I’ll bother with exchange …took quite awhile to get here. Maybe gift it to a younger friend."
2.0,I liked these originally as they fit my smaller wrist.<br />Unfortunately after a day or 2 they were very itchy.
2.0,"It is not the material I thought I was going to be it’s very thin also very short it’s a crop top and it had strings hanging all over it it was badly made . I brought it for a out of town trip so when I opened it , it was too late to return it so I just took a lose on it . It looks super cute in pictures but not that same once you get it ."
2.0,Very pretty necklace. Sadly 2 weeks after Christmas a stone fell out. Another 2 weeks after that the chain broke. I guess you get what you pay for. Very upsetting to give this to my daughter and she loved it only to have it fall apart within a month.
2.0,They were too loose on my face.
2.0,"These are HAND WASH! Otherwise seem quality and cushy but seriously, HAND WASH?!"
2.0,It is unusual that women's pants fit me better than men's pants.  These men's pants  fit but are a bit too big at the waist and I cannot wear them without using a belt. I rather not wear a belt. Maybe my review is not the best one to go according to because I have unusual wants of clothing. I don't like fanciness  just practicality.  The material and cut are pretty good on these pants. They have a bit of stretch. If it had a comfort waist with some elastic sewn in  I think I would like them better.  I did send these back.
2.0,One snap doesn't work and the clips that hold the strap on are cheap and will release the bag on their own.  It was a gift so it's a double shame.
2.0,Don’t care for the material.
2.0,Fits great and looks great but I cant wear it with anything but a black shirt or it will show right through.
2.0,Dice cracked in half the second weak of wearing them.
2.0,"Great design but the material is very thin, see thru almost (and I ordered black). It was my understanding that it would be like a traditional noragi style but the stitching (the thread) was weak. It's like it was cut out of one piece just to cut costs. Looks good but based on materials and feeling alone I would not recommend buying this."
2.0,"Seemed to fit everywhere except for my butt. Wouldn’t sit properly on my hip area. I know I have a big butt but not that big that it doesn’t fit into shorts! I had to return because if I bent over, it wasn’t pretty."
2.0,"Cannot wear, way to big, color not what I was expecting"
2.0,"I ordered a set of (3) medium (m) shirts. I received 2 mediums and a large.<br />Also, they fit a little larger than expected."
2.0,"The cotton fabric used in the shirt is very rough and stiff. It's not a soft cotton. The logo was poorly printed and had problems on the edges.<br />Poor product, disappointed."
2.0,"This product was a bit flimsy.  That was not the worst of it.  The advertising said that it was a dancing singing hat.  It moved in only one direction and the song did not play.  Pertemba was very gracious about returning my money, although I did ask to get another one that worked well instead."
2.0,The product looks nice but the blue stone was missing off of the necklace. When I ordered it I did not realize it would be coming from China so it's taken a while. Still nice for the price.
2.0,To small and was torn on the shoulder
2.0,"Bought bigger because I like my shirts loose ,still don’t fit"
2.0,The color of the bottoms is not the same as in the picture. Additionally there is no support in the top at all.
2.0,This sweater looks so cute and I was so excited to buy it. When it arrived I realized it was VERY thin and extremely cheap quality. Don’t buy. Spend your money on something of better quality.
2.0,Lint balls after one wash
2.0,This wasn't nearly as soft or breathable as the Tommy Copper mask I bought. I would have returned it but I needed them before I was able to exchange.
2.0,Hugs the mess out of your body.  But the favor was soooo soft and thick perfect for winter Balls.
2.0,Feels like tissue paper and clings on body
2.0,"Received this exactly one month ago and the straps have already ripped completely off. I noticed just a few days too late that they were coming loose, so I couldn't return. Very upset because I got so many complements on this purse! Please sent me another that won't fall apart :("
2.0,Fringe along back broker after putting them on a few times.
2.0,"I was looking for magical moisture wicking / ""cooling"" shorts to sleep in during summer or during nightime hotflashes. You get what you pay for... There are bamboo shorts that are much pricier and probably actually work. I would never call these moisture wicking, they are moisture ABSORBING. I wake up with the shorts soaked during hot flashes. Other synthetic sleep shorts or PJs I've had actually breathe and wick moisture away to evaporate these do not.  When washing, I can't put them in the dryer with similar weight fabrics because they never dry! I have to air dry them inside out overnight or longer. :-(<br /><br />Pro: very soft, lovely to wear around the house in summer.<br /><br />Con: NOT moisture wicking at all. Take a very long time to dry, even flipped inside out in the clothes dryer. Too hot to sleep in."
2.0,I am 5'9 at 160 pounds and the knot on this shirt was too high. I ordered a medium. Sleeve length was just slightly too short. Not impressed enough with the quality to reorder.  I am returning.
2.0,"The material and fit were nice. But after only four months of occasional wear, air drying and only washing in cold water, the numbers have peeled off completely. That is not the quality I would hope for after spending this much to specifically have the numbers and logos on this jersey and shorts."
2.0,Product was not as expected.
2.0,Purchased this months ago and haven't worn due to being too small and costs too much to return. Order up a size or two. It does look lovely tho... hanging in the closet.
2.0,Broke shortly after we purchased.
2.0,"The attachment is not secure (unlike the band that ships with the watch, which fits well). It rattles a bit as you move it around. Returned it."
2.0,Update: managed to fix the zipper problem but now it has broken off.<br /><br />I never zip up my purses unless I am in a crowded place so on the day that I need to zip my purse closed I realized the zipper does not properly close. The teeth of the zipper don't clasp and it opens back up. It is a nice looking purse though I'm not crazy about the zipper sliders being so big. It has become my everyday purse but I'll have to buy another purse that I can actually close when needed.
2.0,Loved everything about this purse but my hair kept getting caught in the buckle unfourtantly it’s very annoying
2.0,We had to return this...it was Missing the box you put the batteries in to make it Blow Up!<br />Kinda defeats the purpose of the costume!
2.0,I didn’t realize this wasn’t cotton fabric. It is cute.
2.0,"Fit was just a little smaller than I had expected. The fabric is very weird and cheap for what I paid, (makes me worried to wash them) especially the infant suit and the bottoms. However the tops were nice looking. Overall not what I had expected 👍🏼"
2.0,"I really wanted to like this. Its super cute. My only problem with it (and it my just be my own issue) is that since it opens like a clamshell, I need to make sure everything is laying flat on one side before I can close it. So after I open it to take out my wallet, I basically have to readjust everything before I can close it again."
2.0,It was to small for what i wanted
2.0,At first I was excited which quickly turned to disappointment. Looks just like the picture until you open it and the two large zipper pockets on the inside are really just one gaping pocket with a piece of Velcro. One zipper pocket was hidden on the seem I thought? Wrong just doesn’t exist. Also the zipper is on the wrong side for a normal jacket and the arms and shoulders seem small. I think it’s a women’s jacket. Want to return it just cause I feel kinda deceived and sad. :(
2.0,Nice length I and 5&#34;9 size 14 but if you are a busty person not flattering at all.
2.0,This product is not made for sisters! Not for the ones that have a little extra in the front. If your boobs are a B and below this will fit fine. This isn’t really true to size.
2.0,"Item was definitely too small. End piece was very sharp, not comfortable to wear."
2.0,The stitching was very bad and the band had a lot of snags in it. My son loved it just bc it was Golden State but i was not happy with the quality
2.0,Love love the material. The sleeves are tight and the upper shoulders are large. Awkward fit. Sent it back. Pants runs tight in the tights and loose in the waist
2.0,Much smaller than expected. Love the symbol as it’s special to my husband and myself but it disappears on a key ring.
2.0,"Dress was not what I hoped it would be. The color was different from picture. Definitely orange, not red like it was described. Also the dress was unflattering on me...I felt very matronly in it...no one wants to feel that way in a dress, lol! Maybe I would have liked it more if I was more curvey, but I'm pretty thin with a small chest and I felt like the dress just hung on me. I ordered a size small for reference. Going to try and return it."
2.0,The upper part slides down to elbow
2.0,The Skirt of this dress is very stiff. I thought it would be more flowy.
2.0,This was super cute but didn’t have the wig or magnifying glass had to go buy another wig
2.0,Super cute but broke the first day I wore it
2.0,"I've had several of these types of watches.  And while this one looks great, the construction just isn't where it needs to be.  First, it is very thick, thicker than any of my other watches.  But my biggest issue is with the self-winding nature of the watch, it just doesn't work.  If you are not actively trying to wind the watch every hour it stops.  Most annoying thing ever!  Certainly would not recommend this watch to anyone."
2.0,Really small bags..
2.0,Neckline was not sewed right.
2.0,Quality not good..... wouldn't buy again.
2.0,"This is Fleece lined, not Sherpa. Sherpa is very soft. The fleece is rough, bumpy polyester feeling. Static zaps.<br />Fleece lining is on the hood and full torso, but not arms.<br />Bought XXL for my 6'1 son. Just didn't fit. It did fit his friend who is 5'8 with a tummy.<br />Arms are too short for a tall man.<br />Outer shell is thick typical cotton hoodie material.<br />Body is roomy and average length for a 5'2 to 5'10 man<br />Arms are lined with a slick material, maybe polyester, not fleece. Not padded or quilted.<br />Zipper is Plastic type, but sturdy looking, zips smoothly, nice large pull tab.<br />Pockets are the same material as the body. Smooth and comfortable inside.<br />Hoodie pull strings have big white plastic tabs on them. My son would have cut those off and tied them in a knot.<br />Had to return because it didn't fit and my son wanted a Sherpa lined Hoodie to replace his old one."
2.0,"These tanks are made for a 13-15 year old girl who has not yet developed any breasts. The shelf bra is about 5 inches in height, once you put it on, looks absurd. They are nice and long but provide absolutely no coverage up top. I'm returning."
2.0,Looks better on the picture
2.0,The dress fell apart at the seam about an hour into my party.
2.0,"It WAS an Awesome watch! Solid weight. Great quality for the price - looks and feels like a $55k Rolex.<br /><br />HOWEVER: it only came with a 1yr warranty.  I took a care of it and gently wore it.  After 6 months the battery died.  Had a new one installed by a watch/jewelry store.  Six months later, the watch once again stopped.  Once again took it to a jeweler who tried several new batteries  but was unsuccessful at getting watch to work again.  Unfortunately this watch only came with a one-year warranty and basically died just after the warranty expired.  A real disappointment."
2.0,Band is too tight.Gives me a headache to wear.
2.0,"Cute dress but it’s too big. I’m 4’11” and 85 pounds, I ordered the XS and the dress slips down, the elastic band around the chest is just too big. I’m skinny but all clothes size XS fit me just fine."
2.0,"My daughter is turning 5, so I ordered her the 4-5. It was a little too tight, so I ordered the 6x and it was the exact same size. They basically sent me two ""x-smalls."" Now, I'm ordering the 7-8, which is crazy for an almost 5 year old. Not to mention, I am ""buying"" my third dress! I will return the other two ASAP. Disappointed in the sizing to say the least."
2.0,this dress is SHEER! Loved the color and fit but I wanted a dress I could wear out and about and this would only work as a bathing suit cover up since it is totally see through.
2.0,"This is a high quality hat that is well made with quality materials. With that being said, I would not recommend it however if you have a larger head size. One size fits all definitely does not apply here!"
2.0,"Should have looked at the reviews. The hill feels like styrofoam. Did not wear it, yet. Afraid it might fall apart"
2.0,"Beatiful, but not long enough. If your short of would be perfect. Stopped at bottom of belly. I prefer past crouch area."
2.0,The threads on the seams immediately started to come loose.
2.0,Low quality. Broke on first use.
2.0,"Fabric felt cheap and the whole thing felt a little asymmetrical, like it just wasn't well made. I returned."
2.0,very cheap looking not at all what it looks like in picture
2.0,The only reason I am giving two stars is because the swimsuit is cute. Other then that it is not true to size. It was way too small and the torso is extremely short even for me who doesn't have a long torso. I would not recommend.
2.0,I work in a chicken plant was to thin for me to wear tho
2.0,"The color was nice and i likes the look, but  the band around the top got baggy and loose. The threads were pulling and snagging. Im 5’6”, 150# so its not like i was stretching them out."
2.0,It's very small. Not great for every day use. Already broke the wet sides zipper
2.0,"Well these aren't the ones shown upon buying them... and got 2 pairs of the same kind. They're pretty, most of them. And good value for how inexpensive 12 pairs are. And mine are 13 pairs. But I was really looking forward to some of the big ones which were not in my order."
2.0,"I ordered a charm with a graduation cap, but got a charm that had a tiny 2018 diploma scroll instead.<br />It was so small you couldn’t even make out what it was. It was, in my opinion not worth the price. I was highly disappointed. The recipient though, Liked it and that’s all that matters."
2.0,Material isn’t what I expected but my 13 yr old is extremely happy with sweater and that is all that matters to me.
2.0,it says its a xl but it was more like a medium
2.0,"The charms were in poor condition,  the charm showed in the middle looked like it came from the bubble gum machine. Another one of the charms<br />siding came off."
2.0,Not for tall women...
2.0,"When I finally received it, the product took some fidgeting for it to finally snap into place on the watch. After it was installed, I noticed that one of the adapters was missing the holes where the spring bars fit into for the watch band. Obviously a missed screw up in quality control during the manufacturing process. I contacted the seller who said he/she would ship out a replacement. . . still waiting."
2.0,"I ordered these as a gift for my sister. They felt nice and soft and looked like they had a good amount of cushioning in the footbed. Unfortunately, one of the slippers had a row of glue dots where there should have been sequins but they were missing. Dissapointed that I had to return them."
2.0,"The arms on this are rather tight and longer than expected.  The worse problem, however is the that the neck has a much deeper V than pictured.  A camisole/tank top is needed to wear under it or expect plenty of bra to show.  It is pretty, at least."
2.0,It’s cute. But the cape buttons on. And I’ve Already had to sew it back on. My son loves his Batman tho. It’s always hit or miss with Amazon clothes
2.0,"My son used these for recess and one trip skiing, the inseam came apart under the crotch.  The pant legs had normal wear and tear but holding up so I thought we had a good buy and saved some money, now we either buy a second set somewhere else or he is cut short on his winter play time."
2.0,"Made cheap, wouldn’t buy again!"
2.0,Pretty dress. Wasn't able to wear it. The small should be a large.
2.0,The end that isn't shown in the picture is very large and won't go through my pendent.  I tried it on many of my pendents and it's just way to big.  Other then that it is very nice quality.
2.0,Water comes in
2.0,LIKED<br />- looks okay<br /><br />DISLIKED<br />- all tha accessories are fake and are juss basically printed on<br />- not good for weather whatsoever (to be expected tho)<br />- tha printing wasnt as seemed
2.0,"I don't think so.  I don't know who did the measuring, but it's not 43&#34;"
2.0,Hard and uncomfortable.  Sending back.  I am a 7.5 so I ordered 7.5-10 and it's wayyy too large.  The padding isn't good.
2.0,"Love the idea of this shirt.  Ordered up after reading the reviews, still much smaller than I was hoping for.  Shirt doesn’t seem as long as what is pictures."
2.0,I seized up on this shirt and it was so tiny on me. It barely covered my boobs. I have very long arms but the sleeves were way too short. I think these are junior sizes.
2.0,The quality is good on the band however the clasp is a poor design. It takes two people to put on the band and two people to take it off.
2.0,"The screenprint with hand is larger than it appeared on your website. No labels, or washing instructions, Definatly throwing this into a Goodwill box. Website pics do not properly represent product. Will no longer purchase any clothing from Amazon."
2.0,"Cheap lanyard, wouldn't buy it again."
2.0,"Based on reviews I bought a medium because I have a bigger chest and I’ve got a belly(34DD, 140lbs) this tank is huge and it’s not the same quality as the photos. It’s a cheap see through white and the back is way more open than pics, even just laying flat the back is open. Overall poor fit and quality."
2.0,"The material feels and looks cheap and tacky. It’s very shiny and “cheesy” looking such that I did not want my son running around town wearing this. It was very cheap though, and I’m sure my son would have liked it."
2.0,Ok let me just start off by saying it says the shirt runs small. I generally wear an XL. Ok so I get a 2XL. Wow. This shirt fits me like a medium or maybe even a small. If you wear those sizes go waaaayyyy up if you wanna buy this shirt. I gave it 2 starts cause it was soft.
2.0,"Works for my costume, but totally disappointed in product.  The fabric dye rubs off on my hands, etc. with the slightest contact and it sheds, considerably.  Inferior quality, not a &#34;finished&#34; product.  Should be described and priced as costume NOT wearable garment."
2.0,"I agree with another reviewer - these are not the same item as advertised. These have an elastic  waistband so they are bunchy around the torso and not sewn with the biased waistband with buttons like in the photo. The legs are also longer than the ankle length that the model is wearing -  I’m 5’9” and they come almost to the floor on me. I mistakenly ordered a large, but I should’ve followed the recommendation to get my actual size. Usually I order a size or two up with these types of brands, but the description even states that they are US sizes and not Asian - which are traditionally 2-3 sizes smaller. However even with them being a size too big, they are definitely not the same pants as advertised and I will be returning them."
2.0,Semi good product. As soon as I used it the strings on zippers came right off everything else held up fine.
2.0,One of He shoes will not keep a charge. Disappointed little girl!
2.0,"I expected these to smooth out any bumpiness around the middle, and they didn’t, they just clung to the rolls. Sticking with Spanx from now on!"
2.0,Cute but too flimsy<br />It bent the first time I wore it
2.0,Way to small. I cut the toes off and made little leg warmer tubes . The color rubs off easily also.
2.0,"The sweater arrived with threads hanging from the waist the sleeves and the neck hems.  I used scissors to trim them as close as possible to the end of the stitch.  The hem at the neck and the waistband are both coming undone, so it looks like there are 1&#34; - 2&#34; tears at the side of the neck and waistband.<br /><br />Very dissatisfied."
2.0,Too small for a large size
2.0,"It was too large; just did not fit well. Returned to sender on 4/23/19. Will just buy something else besides clothing; as I have hard time buying clothing online that fit me well. I am sorry. The Best, Gale Stanley"
2.0,"I wanted a gray sweater, this is more like a brown gray color."
2.0,Material is very flimsy.  Not what I expected.  Also very very wrinkled.  I haven't tried them on. I think I will be donating them.
2.0,These are NOT titanium coated they are just regular needles and can be purchased for less elsewhere.
2.0,"I have no idea, it will be a gift. Quit bugging me and I'll give you a rating when I have one. Two star until then due to constant requests."
2.0,This was oversized. I ordered large and it is super large. Like twice what I would expect. Also very long. Perhaps made for big and tall people.
2.0,Description did not match the product. The product is poor in quality.
2.0,Too small and the material is super cheap!
2.0,"This bag has a very awkward zipper that hangs which makes it hard to find things in it. If I saw this bag in person, I would have never bought it."
2.0,Does  not have any internal pocket I find it uncomfortable not being able to separate my phone from the keys.
2.0,runs small very disappointed. Had to return.
2.0,This shirt is very short!  The belt was right under the bust.  The arm holes are snug. It feels like it is petite sizing.
2.0,Like the color and design.  A little top heavy so if the earring is up too high it will fall over a bit. Overall I really like the earring and have had compliments on it. Very comfortable also. Update : After wearing this for a few weeks the rose gold color starting fading where it’s hitting my ear. Disappointed because I liked it but won’t be in much longer.
2.0,"If you're ordering a larger size I would skip this shirt. I ordered an extra large and the size that came looked like maybe more of a medium. The material is stretchy but pretty see-through when stretched. It just didn't fit comfortably as an extra large. If you're petite this shirt will probably be fine, although it's not the greatest quality, and for any size, I would recommend sizing up."
2.0,"My son liked the look of this shoe, but the traction is horrible. He switched back to his old pair."
2.0,"This 1/4 zip sweater is fairly lightweight and the quarter zip collar is also a nice feature but the fabric's feel made me return it without even trying it on.  The fabric is soft but has a strange plastic feel to it.  Is sort of feels almost greasy?  I'm not saying that it is dirty, it's just what came to mind when touching the fabric. Maybe strangely synthetic is a better description.  Worst, when I ran my hand over the fabric, the fabric snagged on it.  Now, I don't have especially calloused hands and neither does my wife, but we both immediately felt the same things - snags and pulls when brushing our hand over the fabric.  So it's not for me and I returned it."
2.0,The color is vibrant and wallet has the amount of compartments that I need but it has a horrible fish smell that will not go away
2.0,"Buying on amazons feels a little like playing Zathura or Jumangi against a Sicilian when death is on the line. If you read the words ""cotton nightgowns"", ""all cotton nightgowns"", and ""100% cotton nightgowns"" sprinkled liberally throughout the listing you might start to feel assured that you are purchasing a cotton nightgown. Fail! If you make the wrong color selection and miss the one  ambiguous hidden clue that it might not be the same fiber as the other colors. Trying to find woven cotton nightgowns (under $50) is quite the quest. Moral of the story is that if you get the (prints?) Wrong color selection you may get polyester for the price of cotton. That said, I ordered the brown print and as a poly nightgown I'd give it 4stars tho I wouldn't have paid nearly as much."
2.0,"Sometimes when people say it broke, you gotta take it with a grain of salt because, reality is, it was probably their fault.  In this case, these suckers seriously just broke.  My guy is super tolerable and gentle and only wore them a few times.  I picked them up one day and the side just came off.  I think this hairline fracture might have been there already or was waiting to pop.  We seriously barely used these and I know for sure we were gentle.  Totally disappointing.  I am just getting around to reviewing. But they broke within a few weeks of purchase and I didn’t try to return until about a week after the 30 day return window closed.  I’ve tried to fix them but I just can’t do it sadly."
2.0,The item/charm I received did not exactly look like the charm in the picture. Disappointed but it was a gift so not returning it.
2.0,Not a good fit.  I ordered larger than usual but still too tight in shoulders and hips.  Color not a pure white.  Pretty style but I can't wear it.
2.0,"The picture shows more of a blue tint, but they are Really green and even more so when you put them on."
2.0,"I took Jessica Braun's recommendation and wish I would've. The fabric is thinner, but can be ok it under a dress. When you get the product it said something to the tune as one size fits all. I am a large, so I don't agree that the same size for small isn't stretched to hell to cover my curves. Don't spurge for the yoga band. The only difference is a different zigzag stitch at the top."
2.0,Washed for first time: cold water low dry temp. Shirt lost its sheen and collar was stiff and did not want to fold properly. I expected more from this shirt that was so beautiful coming out of the package.
2.0,"They looked amazing on the photo but not in person. The foam around the edges that presses against your face is very, very thin. The strap is not sturdy enough to go around the snowboarding helmet. They do not sit tight enough even with the strap on the smallest setting which means they will fog. Came without a case. Returning and being charged $6.15 for shipping (which is half of what they cost). Not worth it!"
2.0,I’m 5’7” and ordered my usual size. This dress is more like a long tunic. I think it would fit as picturedw if you were 5’3” or under.
2.0,Great looking hat BUT way too small. I will be returning it.
2.0,This was listed as a Charm. Not a necklace with a charm. It’s super tiny. More for a little kid. Don’t purchase if it’s for an adult.
2.0,"Love the fabric and the print of the dress, I bought the navy blue, however I ordered a large and the top portion doesn’t cover my chest at all! I’m a 36C and I couldn’t make it work. The whole top portion was just weird fitting."
2.0,I didn't like it because I couldn't fit barely anything in it for my wallet. I really wanted it to work because I love the Idea of using old firehose. I returned it.
2.0,The product is cute but is definitely not durable. We had barely touched it and the gemstones were already falling off. Definitely not a long term toy. Luckily we only need it for Halloween.
2.0,"Delivery was delayed and it came with cheap looking vinyl stickers. I wasn't expecting something amazing for a license plate cover, however I expected better than this. Cafe press did make things right when I asked for a refund. All in all because of their customer service I would do business with them again. Unfortunately I now know the quality to expect from their products."
2.0,Anchoring strap broke off after second use. Now there's a hole in it. The material is super thin and it will not keep you warm.<br /><br />Super cute colors. Not functional.
2.0,Feels on the cheaper side. Inside pocket seem broke after the first use.
2.0,"I ordered this dress in both Pink and Pink Flesh in a size small and decided to return both because the fabric quality is so poor. I didn’t expect the fabric to be great but it was so thin that it was  completely see through. I’m not sure if a darker color would have been better, but I would not recommend the lighter colors. Aside from the poor quality fabric, the fit was as expected and it would have been a cute dress."
2.0,Too large in my usual size.
2.0,"Don’t waste your time on these. The pictures are misleading. The material is very thick and ribbed. The neckline is high, closer to that of a t-shirt, and the straps are really thick. It was not flattering at all or what I was expecting. If you want something that looks like the photos, do not buy this."
2.0,"The title IS misleading.  Can’t believe I missed the reviews……. Silk is a natural fiber, poly is not.  For those of us with dysautonomia, that matters, as many of us cannot wear polyester.<br />I knew instantly when I felt it before seeing the tag that it was poly.<br />Size and edges are fine enough for me, but the fabric content is deal-breaker.<br />BEWARE THE MISLEADING TITLE."
2.0,This is huge! The measurements listed on the page are completely wrong! You could fit a laptop in this thing. Not at all what I was looking for.
2.0,Ordered a small but it fit like a medium.
2.0,"Within 5 minutes of wearing the band the strap popped on one end. So, I had to return it literally the next morning after delivery."
2.0,"This strap looks good, but it is so think and rigid, it is almost impossible to put on and wear.  I've tried everything I can think of to make it bendable, but it feels like a manacle when I wear it!"
2.0,"The only thing manly about these is the labeling.  They look like they took fat girls panty hose and shaped them like drawers. they have a wimpy waistband too. If you wore these to work, you might have to punch someone in the nose when they insult you. Not even good for around the house because you will feel like a cross dresser when you wear these. Don't waste your cash with these. BTW, they also ride up and your nuts fall out- completly  useless."
2.0,Did not realize this tied in the front. That is awkward to me.
2.0,"Like the dress, but I’m missing a green emerald button on one side of the dress and I didn’t receive my yellow string to tie the middle. Upset that I paid so much"
2.0,"The picture is not how this outfit fit. I'm not sure what body style you need to have in order for this fit to look right, but it did not look right on me. I made me look bigger than I was. The sweater was so high and the sleeves were extremely long on me. Given I'm shorter in statue, but it didn't look as classy as the picture. It didn't even look good with it open, so I decided to return and get my money back. Also, the material is very think and heavy, good to wear in the winter."
2.0,"I cannot believe anyone would give this jacket five stars.  I did order a size larger and the fit was good, the color as expected.  The back of the sleeves near the shoulder seams gaped and made it look like I had budding wings. And it was flat.  There was no puffiness in it that would indicate it had a down fill.  I even put it in my dryer on fluff for 30 minutes and it was still flat.  Too much money for a shell.  It is going back!"
2.0,"It looks pretty cheap and the hat is too small for my head... I never had this issue before, with any hat. It seems as if it was manufactured for a kid."
2.0,Needless to say the last time I got a pair of fangs from Dental Distortions was back in 2010… and those were movie FX quality stuff! Just so we’ll made! So I had a werewolf thing I wanted to do for Halloween this year and boy has this company gone down hill. The staining and paint job looks horrible… the teeth are thin and made of a different material than I remember… and they didn’t give me nearly enough therma beads to get a decent fit. I don’t know what happened in 12 years… maybe the demand got too high and they started cutting corners… definitely wasn’t worth the price I paid. Needless to say I didn’t get to use them this Halloween.
2.0,short from waist to crotch area and too large on top
2.0,Had to return it fits small
2.0,"The shorts are are white instead of matching the dress. Sadly, I thought it looked like my underwear was showing rather than making a cute golf outfit. If you don't mind that, the fabric is nice and wrinkle resistant and the design itself is cute."
2.0,Not made very well. Bought it specifically for the horn and made my own headband.
2.0,I have bought a few of these. Used to love them. They changed sizing nor mine
2.0,"If it twisted slightly on my wrist, it would easy unlock the mechanism and I'd lose my watch EVERYWHERE. At least 5-10 times a day.... it even fell into a toilet. So I went back to the original, plain black band, and I have not had it fall off once."
2.0,The dress came smelling like horrible fish. I tried to air it out for 2 days and it wouldnt go away. I paid shipping costs for this and the seller didnt cover that cost when i wanted to return it die to the dress too large and the smell.
2.0,Zero stretch or flexibility in this shirt. The fit was good but as far working out goes it leaves something to be desired.
2.0,the colors were off. Too much flesh and yellow colors for my liking.
2.0,"Doesn’t match the description. It’s too small, too short, cheaply made, thin material and overpriced for the low quality. I decided to give it to my 12 year old niece. Fits her perfectly."
2.0,Had two pods break first time using em. If you want durability go with the dye lock lid
2.0,They arrived at my home bent😞
2.0,"This top is sized really weird, the sparkly part underneath is WAY to big and the outer part fits pretty much true to size.  I really wouldn't suggest ordering unless you are large busted.  Or else you'll have to pin/alter the inner garnet.  The quality of the fabric is reflected in the price.  However, I would keep it if it fit properly,, it's still a cute top but I wouldn't expect to make it through more than two washings."
2.0,Too big for me and one of the things that holds it on your ears broke
2.0,He l looked like a b. Had to return. The rest of the letters looked fine.
2.0,"The material is nice, as stated in other reviews. However, the belt is missing and the drawstring for the pants is broke also the hat is  way too small for a 6-9 yr old. It's cute, but definitely not worth being broken and missing parts."
2.0,Fit well but the plastic ..not lens..turns yellow.<br />Only used in a pool so maybe chlorine
2.0,"It does work with touchscreen but its fit was too small (I ordered the large size). I had to give these gloves to my girlfriend and still, they were very tight for her."
2.0,It turned so fast I didn’t have time to get a good wear out of it
2.0,"Im a 33"" waist and there was no way these would fit, bought a medium which is the size i wear, no room for your goods, they will get smashed."
2.0,Is not for an adult size head.<br />It fits right to my 5 year old daughter.
2.0,LOOKS kind of different from the displayed picture.
2.0,"I am 5'11"" so I do often have issues with sleeve length, but the sleeves on this jacket were particularly short on me.  They were 3/4 sleeve and it didn't work.  On top of that, the lace eyelet is distressed and there are big holes in the jacket.  At first I thought it was damaged but after a closer look, it is deliberate.  Maybe I'm old (I probably am old), but the look didn't work.  It just looked like a dog got ahold of it and chewed it up.<br />If I missed the boat on the distressed lace eyelet with holes trend and you are OK with the really short sleeves, the rest of the jacket was nice.  A great thicker jacket, with a nice weight but it wouldn't get too hot.  I just couldn't get past the sleeve length and the holes."
2.0,"too narrow, too long."
2.0,NOT GOOD FOR DIABETICS
2.0,Received dress and it’s beautiful yet there’s a big white glob on the dress that looks like glue. Not happy at all
2.0,"It was to small at the bust line,and it's was  Suppose to have Pockets, That I thought."
2.0,fabric is not as expected
2.0,Too expensive for what it is.
2.0,I ordered a size bigger than normally needed. I read the reviews and most of them said they were small. When they arrived they were to small. Now I have to order another pair. :(
2.0,"Not quite as dark as I expected... I have a pair of old Oakleys that I was looking to replace, hoping that these would do the trick.  Unfortunately, they did not live up to the &#34;Super Dark.&#34;  They fit great and are comfortable, just not dark."
2.0,I elected not to attach pictures because there were so many flaws. I immediately had to sew two places straight out of the package then the next set was so thin an worn… I don’t expect them to last through a wash but the fit an style is perfect! Quality sux.
2.0,Not what I expected.  This unfortunately did not have pockets as mentioned and it’s not a soft fabric.
2.0,Did not like the material.  Looks very cheap
2.0,Unworkable because the thin white straps over the chest are not equal and are too long so it all weird over my chest
2.0,"While this is packaged nicely, it's actually lightweight pieces of chromed plastic. From the picture, it appears to be a quality metal. The bigger problem is the instruction video. The most frustrating part of getting a tie &#34;perfect&#34; isn't just the knot, it's also getting the length of the tail piece/or shorter end the right length. This is not even discussed on the video instructions. Furthermore, the video is a bit hard to follow as it should have been shot from slightly above and behind, as opposed to straight on. This way you don't get your lefts and rights confused. I must have practiced 15 times before getting the shorter end of the tie right, and then the knot right. Great concept, poor execution. I ended up finding a Youtube video that helped create a perfect knot, with some easy technique to get the length right, too."
2.0,Very horrible build quality
2.0,Cheaply made and gaudy.  You get what you pay for.
2.0,I bought 2 the blue and the pink one the arrived with one missing stone
2.0,Cheaply made for the price. Took it out of the package and the decal was peeling off.  See the picture
2.0,Fits more like and xl definitely not plus size. Ordered for a friend she gave it to me because the size is off
2.0,I was disappointed in the dress when I put it on ..very cute but the material was ravish. The slip underneath kept going up wouldn't stay still the piece that goes around the arm ripped I became frustrated my friends end up taking the sleeve part and stuffing it under my armpit because we did not want to tear the entire dress since it was my outfit for the evening..
2.0,Perhaps I should have read the reviews a bit more closely.  I did not like the fabric these were made of.  Sadly returned them.
2.0,I wear a small-medium & these are too small & actually tight at the calf:-(
2.0,"These discolored during the wear with a white film, and to clean it off causes the gold to rub off"
2.0,was not aware how skinny it was.
2.0,This shirt is way bigger than a medium maybe a xxl. It’s huge and it’s very long.
2.0,"I thought this dress looked so cute in pictures and I ordered a large. Perhaps a medium would have fit better, but the waistline is so high that it could be a maternity dress. It looked quite different on the model."
2.0,They turned me green the first day wearing them.
2.0,"Okay so let's start. This initially fit very small, but as you wear it it does get looser. It will lose all of its shape. It becomes this unflattering fit. The fabric is stiff like a poorly starched piece of clothing. Just not good."
2.0,The buckle broke in half after only 3 months. I honestly expected more from a $30 belt.
2.0,Color isn't what is shown in the photo....more brown than the burgundy I was looking for!
2.0,The PAINT ( BLUE ) started coming off the first day I used it!
2.0,"This is nice however very cheaply made. I have purchased two of these and each time I wore it, it broke and the crystals always come off. You get what you pay for. If you buy it I would suggest getting your picture in it right away before it breaks on you."
2.0,I was given only 3 weeks to return this which was a problem since it was a gift and I had to get it back first to return it. The large fits like a xx large! My daughter is a size 12 so large would be appropriate but it is way too big! My daughter's family told her she looked like a bag lady in them! They are soft I only wish they fit someone in my family....or that they would exchange them for a medium.
2.0,"I am not very happy with this sweater. It does not look or fit at all like the picture. It’s more like a cowl neck sweater. The top part will not stay down off my shoulders, it pops back up (and all I am doing is sitting). It is not fitted at the bottom to bunch up, so it looks more like a dress. It is a top I will wear this winter and then get rid of (hence the two stars)."
2.0,Cute but runs small and is very short
2.0,"The dress looked nice on the picture, but it was too short. I'm only 5'4"", but it looked like a teddy on me."
2.0,I did not receive the style my daughter chose. She was super bummed when these came instead. This seems to happen whenever I order underwear from here. I guess I will change that.
2.0,"The main thing is the cheap material. At this point I have no faith in clothes bought from Amazon to be as expected. The description for this shirt says '65% cotton, 35% polyester' but as you can see on the photo of the tag, that's a bold faced lie. It is 88% polyester and 12% cotton and I could immediately feel the difference. Its rough and thin. The first time I put it on it didn't fit right like the neck had been stretched and the shoulder strap didn't sit right but when I put it back on for the photo it fit much better, idk what that was about. It's a little short on the torso but I think it's suppose to be like that. I'd love it if it were what it says it is, so I'm going to send it back and see if I can buy it from a different seller."
2.0,Super cute on the model but does NOT look good on me. :(
2.0,It’s a rubber mask that folds in when you put it on. You are not able to see the full mask.
2.0,nope<br />i did not like the t shirt neck
2.0,"I wore these glasses twice, and screw fell out that attaches arm to lens. Very disappointed."
2.0,"Not a very good fabric. Just by trying it on, it's already loosing shape. Fits small. Fabric is slightly see through."
2.0,"This should only come in toddler sizes. My son is 8 and I got it for him in a size 8. It looked like I had intentionally dressed him like a baby. I sent it back. But if you are getting for a toddler, it was pretty cute."
2.0,Design is nice. L does not fit comfortably. Ordered XL and now have to return both.
2.0,"Design is ok, and it runs small."
2.0,Super cute and soft but also super see through! Not for older girls for sure! Kiddo can’t even wear a light colored bra under it or everything shows.
2.0,This is the best luggage I have ever owned! I travel for a living and this luggage is rock solid and the smoothest rolling luggage I have ever had! Must have for travelers.
2.0,The first order fit good. Sevcond order was smaller. No stretch. Didn’t like. Can’t wear.
2.0,It's too see-thru
2.0,"Runs very small, ordered a medium which is the size I alway wear and I couldn’t even snap this closed"
2.0,"I really wish this dress would have worked out because I liked the material and the length but the middle section is all rouched up and elastic so it fit really strange! It was neither empire waist nor was it on my actual waist! It made me look absolutely shapeless.<br />The buttons are just sewed into place, which is fine, but the color was really awkward. They need to put some sort of lapels or they need to make the neckline just a bit lower because it sat so high that it looked like I had just escaped off of the farm!<br />And then there is the coloring. The picture makes it look like it’s more of a cream background with tasteful, pinkish flowers here and there when in reality, it looks chaotic and more like something a cabbage patch doll is packaged in. In person, when you actually get a good look at the fabric, the background is actually an annoying shade of baby pink with some white and then very pink flowers. I’m not as upset about the coloring because admittedly, it is a hard fabric to accurately photograph but that in addition to the cut and style make it a no-go for me.<br />A lot of potential but they missed the actual mark."
2.0,"My friend recommended these. She said they were very comfortable. So I bought the small. I can wear anything between a 4-6. These are huge! Much larger than my current underwear. So I ordered an xsmall. Those are too small. Not sure if the smalls were mismarked but comparing the two shows a huge difference from xsmall to small. Sadly, I wanted to like them but sizing is odd. They will be returned."
2.0,"The style of this top is so awkward. The design is cute, but I don’t like how short it is in the front. It’s basically a crop top in the front if you lift your arms up and then it’s longer in the back. Then from the side view in the mirror the front flowiness of the shirt made me look pregnant.<br /><br />I also followed other reviewers’ suggestions of ordering a size up. I’m usually a size L but I ordered a XL which fit better. It was a little looser on the sleeves, but if I got a size L then it probably would’ve been tighter on my chest area.<br /><br />Overall I wasn’t happy with the style of this top so I will be returning it."
2.0,To thick for the size of western ear holes. It's almost like a starter for gages.
2.0,Kinda cheap not at all the same description. I gave them away instead of returning tho.
2.0,They dent by just looking at them. Looks good just not a every day wear item for that reason.
2.0,"Only 1 of the 3 ended up being lined, other 2 were missing the lining. Quality without the lining is poor. The lined one was amazing though!"
2.0,"The Rosary is beautiful, but I am sure. It's not Sterling Silver"
2.0,"At first, I loved this chain. It was exactly what I wanted. I had a diamond pendant that was a gift from my husband that was tricky to fit to a chain (it wouldn't fit over the clasp of many chains), but this one fit perfectly. Unfortunately, the chain broke in about a week, and my diamond pendant is lost. I would not repurchase."
2.0,Priced too higher than price tag!!!
2.0,"I ordered a 9, I ordered a men's size for a wider shoe, they barely fit in length. They are marked 42, which is an 8.5 European men's size. I'm keeping them because they are cute/different than regular flip flops."
2.0,Worked great for 2 weeks now doesn't move.  Will be contacting seller.
2.0,The description for sizing was for men/women size medium.  It should be for men only.  The gloves were much too large.
2.0,So annoyed that it does not come with belt as pictured and really really short.  Not for a person that has butt.  I’m a size 29 waist and height is 5.8. To the seller: Don’t use the cover photo with a belt if the dress doesn’t come with it . Bummed.
2.0,"Order three colors on separate orders and all of them fit differently. All the same size(2x) all but one, fit perfect length and all. The others fit xl or 1x. Not hitting my ankles at all  and I’m  5’4”."
2.0,"The dress is cute. The material is soft and it seems true to size. However, there is some kind of stain/heat transfer defect right on the chest design below one of the birds. I'll try to wash it out but overall I'm a little disappointed. I don't think my two year old will notice and the accessories are fun."
2.0,Save your money.  These are cheaply made and the ear holes (that your ears go into) are very small.  I ordered these as a gag.  I wish I had chosen a different gag.
2.0,I pulled them up and RIP! I didnt expect much for $9.99 and Im glad i did not.
2.0,the chain was not great it had pieces stuck on top of each other I could not fix it So I never used it
2.0,Other xx Large shirts fit well. This shirt is too small
2.0,The gold and silver are not as defined as it appears in the advertisement photo.  And the swans are kind if hard to see.  If the charm was a little bigger I think they could do a better job.  I'm thinking about returning it.
2.0,It looks great in the photo. I wasn't impressed with it in person. The Carbon inlay looked cheesy.
2.0,"I like the material and the shape of the bra but feel that it could be a little larger in the cups as it is somewhat uncomfortable.  Also, the straps are so narrow that when I wore it for an afternoon working in my garden, at day's end my shoulders had deep, red, grooves  caused by the straps.  From the reviews I understand that many people loved the bra.  It just didn't work out for me."
2.0,"Good if you want some sort of a running/workout sweater, nothing more. Very soft and comfortable but wouldn't recommend for the cold."
2.0,Too short of a length for a dress
2.0,"The price is OK, if they fit. I read the reviews, so I went up a size. They're still too small."
2.0,I ordered a 2x and it's smaller than a large size. It's a disappointment because it's so cute.
2.0,"I ordered a 2X based on the size chart and other reviews, but it is still smaller than I would like. I normally would wear an XL. Also, the color is completely different than what I expected and wanted, too. It's more of a sage green, whereas the picture online looks like a grass green."
2.0,"Guess they think you only have one foot. For the price, not worth it, and you only get one. The top rubs against your shoe, does not feel comfortable."
2.0,Very thin material and way too short.  I am 5'7&#34; and it barely covered my ankles.  Nothing like the model in the pic unless she 4'9&#34;.
2.0,"The fabric is literally a thin T-shirt material. I purchased the black polka dot pattern. The bust area wasn’t tight on me, but it does have a white hue to it…like the material is being stretched! I’m 5’4”, 155 lbs., sz 36B. Keep searching for a fun summer dress, this isn’t the one you’re looking for!"
2.0,My daughter is handicapped and doesn't move around much. She sleeps in my bedroom so I know how still she sleeps. Still one pair has gorilla tape down both sides where the seam just popped open. The other pair came loose from elastic around waist and one leg. I just threw that pair out. I have plenty of gorilla tape so maybe the one pair she is still wearing will last till after Christmas. Happy Holidays every one.
2.0,"Normally wear 2x, but the 3x fit like a 1x"
2.0,Trying to get someone to return my call for exchange to bigger size! Several days trying.
2.0,I think I received a returned item. Part was assembled and part was not. Then wouldn't fit together properly. If I had time I'd have sent it back.
2.0,"The coat and vest were decent for the price.  But the pants were garbage.  A super weird cut, and single stitched very cheaply.  And the thighs of the pants were crazy narrow.  They went right in the trash."
2.0,The only problem is being able to buy it! They jumped from $78.00 to $89.00 then $166.00 and now a whopping 399.00!! Every time I save my money they raise it more!! I guess they don't have the inventory to keep low prices!
2.0,It is a good warranty but not for $40 for rubber ring
2.0,Pretty cheap.  Big toe holes within a couple of wearings despite trimmed toe nails.
2.0,"I typically don't place orders for products with little to no reviews. Based on other Versa product reviews, I thought I would try out this newer and more expensive model. I like the sleek look of the winder and use of carbon fiber. I was disappointed to find how cheap the product feels when I recieved it. Additionally the logo in the front and center really ruined it for me."
2.0,"Loved the purse, but within two weeks the metal knob fell off and parts began to crack. Disappointed."
2.0,"I love the bright colors and the price is decent but the clip doesn't hold very securely. When you are a swimmer counting on your goggles staying in place, that is not acceptable. Would not purchase again."
2.0,"Really not as effective as I would have hoped for.  I had planned on using for cords, the actual plugs for my iPad, etc, but they just didn't really work out for me.  They just were not that secure, became rather bulky, and didn't hold as much as I would have liked.  In the end, I should have tried the cord roll bag or the cord organizer that was a little more bulky but zipped up and was self-contained.<br /><br />I would return if I could.<br /><br />If you only have small usb cords, ink pens and some thumb drives, this would probably work for you.  I just had too many other items that made it less than optimal."
2.0,Late delivery. Updates to tracking never happened. Enjoy the product upset that it arrived at least 3 days after its stated delivery date.
2.0,Color is pretty but the earrings didn’t line up with the clasp well at all. I had a hard time getting them in and I found that they came unclasped a lot too.
2.0,"I am 5' 8&#34; and these are too short. After one use they stained from being in the rain (cycling). And they shrunk even more after washing them (machine wash, hang dry). I would not recommend these."
2.0,Mask was good but doesn’t stay on so I use two face tape
2.0,"Material makes it extremely difficult to breathe even without a filter.  They are supposed to be faith based,  but one of the 3 designs has a marijuana leaf on it."
2.0,booooi
2.0,Ugly with a flimsy brim flapping down over my eyes... Don't run or bike with this or you might be in danger. I keep it on my &#34;Don't buy this again&#34; trunk.
2.0,I haven’t tried the dress on yet. Disappointed with the fabric.
2.0,Nice dress.  Nice colors..but NOT AT ALL AS SHOWN ON THE PICTURE.  Dress is made of soft polyester fabric.  You would need to put something under it to get this fullness.  Definitely not what i expected. You get what you pay for.  Takes several weeks to get it.  Took so long. ...I forgot i ordered it!  ;)  i would not recommend to a friend or enemy!😞😞
2.0,"It was cute at first, but it pilled after one wash. They can be removed with a trimmer, but it already looks worn."
2.0,"It probably is great, but I couldn’t get the springs to fit my watch like they’re supposed to. Connectors were too wide."
2.0,Sloppy
2.0,Very cheaply made. Didn't fit good at all
2.0,Pretty necklace but didn’t lay right on the neck. It twisted and was hard to get it to lay correctly. Sent this back and got a different one that I’m happy with.
2.0,"These are extremely poor quality for what they are. The fabric is poor quality, stitching is sloppy, I can’t imagine that they’ll hold up very long, and I’m pretty disappointed for the price. I gave them 2 stars because they “will work” for little while and I don’t want to go through the hassle of packaging them up and paying for shipping to send them back, but I would not purchase these again. Do yourself a favor and spend just a bit extra for some GREAT quality cycling gloves that will hold up significantly longer."
2.0,"The skirt for me, I'm a size 14. The waistband is elastic. Skirt is not fluffy and thick. It's 2 layers so it's see thru. Not what I'm looking for"
2.0,Very disappointed in the quality of the bag. The look is very nice but the quality is very cheap. I guess that what you get at that price though.  I will be using it for a while but I know it will not last.
2.0,"Love this brand and the fit, it’s durable but faded dramatically after a couple washes. Now it looks like I got it at a thrift store even though it’s still new. I am leery spending the money in other sweaters now because I don’t know if they will fade like that one! Still loyal to the brand but sad about the fading Evan with proper care."
2.0,The gloves are not waterproof in snow and my fingure tips never stay warm with the gloves
2.0,Runs really small. Bought a size up so it would be extra roomy. Glad I did or it wouldn’t fit at all.  Does not stretch.  My small cat barley fits in it.  If you have a medium to large cat don’t bother.
2.0,I wore this a few times and it was a cheap gold color. After a few weeks it started changing to a coppery color and looks to cheap to wear. With shipping and handleing I paid $10. Way to much since this looks like it came out of a gum ball machine.
2.0,It looks nice but it’s missing one of the little pins to add on the last link. It’s too small without that last link so will have to return.
2.0,Image looks smudged also the material of this hoodie is cheap and easy to snag and mess up. Also the vibrant color in the picture it does not come like that at all Looks very cheap dont except it to look like you bought it out the mall.. Not worth the money!!
2.0,These are more like pajama styled sweat pants. Thin without form. Perfectly fine for the price of this is what you’re looking for.
2.0,"The zipper is a really bad plastic and the buttons didn’t line up, also it started to tear a whole in the pocket pretty fast"
2.0,I sent these masks back because they were flimsy with gaps & no chin compartment.
2.0,Not as form fitting as it appears.
2.0,Waited forever to arrive and then the sizing is way off.  I normally wear a Medium and ordered an XXL and it is still too tight around the chest and shoulder.  Waste of money even if I did get it with a coupon for under $40.00.
2.0,Beautiful dress but the sizes are not accurate with American sizing.
2.0,Great for light outdoor activity. Not a durable work glove. I'm not sure how the -30 rating was determined either.
2.0,Bad experience. The leg and glass was coming out when kids are playing with it. Should have bought a durable one and so not recommended for kids
2.0,"I returned, was more of a shirt material- not a blazer"
2.0,"This dress looks nothing like the picture and it is not for tall people like myself.  I am 5'11"" and this looks nothing like the picture on me.  the elastic portion lays right below my breast comfortably."
2.0,Looks like a scarf in the photos. Looks like a throw blanket in real life. Way too big.
2.0,"I wear a 2x ,bought 4 x and it is too small."
2.0,Breaks really easily. The Honda strap piece broken the 3 days off my key ring. Only good for the fob cover.
2.0,"The material is flimsy and has a sort of shiny plastic sheen to it. Because the material is thin, there is gapping at the buttons if the dress is fitted, but a larger size hangs weirdly."
2.0,I like the shoes they are nice however way too big!! Not true to size
2.0,"These pjs were much less comfy cozy than expected-- the waffle material was not soft as expected, and the elastic waistband was incredibly tight. The shade of grey I chose was also not pretty or flattering."
2.0,Was waaaay too small. I ordered a large and it fit like a small. Sizing is off.
2.0,"Could be that I received a defective pair, but I'm giving these a 2 star based on durability. Purchased the laces in Dec 2014 and after using them in my MTB shoes for 6 months, one of them broke. I ride 3 times a week, and expected that the laces would last much longer than they did. The problem was that the covering over the bands separated and once the bands are exposed, they start breaking. Just not built in a very robust fashion."
2.0,"I ordered size 2X as I am 5'10&#34; and 170 lbs.  apparently this dress wasn't made for long waisted people, either.  The dress comes to above my knees, which is NOT cool, but it also starts poofing out right at my belly, making me look pregnant at the ripe old age of 57."
2.0,Awful Fabric. Cheap Cheap Cheap!
2.0,Don't buy if you are tall. I'm 5'10 and the slit in back went to bum. Returned.
2.0,"The metal clasp was so tight that we couldn't get them unhooked and my husband had to get a tool to adjust them. Before doing that, one of the metal hooks came off, but we managed to get it back on.<br />They are pretty earrings, just poor quality."
2.0,I really loved this ring as it was breathable for my finger so my eczema wouldn’t flare up like my other wedding ring. I’m very disappointed because the cluster o diamonds fell out today after having it only almost 2 months. I took it off to wash and shower and apply lotion so I don’t understand
2.0,"Although it is made well, the material is strange. It's like a heavyweight, Spandex that hangs loosely. It did not feel good against my skin. It felt heavy and hot."
2.0,Uncomfortably tight.
2.0,"I LOVE this bathing suit, but I got a 2XL & the top is still way too small.  the bottoms are a little big.  Obviously not made for large busted women.  I wear a 38DD & was coming out the top & bottom of the top"
2.0,"The dress isn’t bad, the sleeves are big but I think that’s obvious from the photo. The fit has some stretch but it was as I expected. The texture is off. It feels plasticy. Almost like a really thin throw away vinyl table cloth you get for a kids birthday party. My daughter said it “felt cheap” it had a few loose threads but nothing you couldn’t snip off. My teen said she didn’t like it so I’m going to be returning."
2.0,"Great designs, but the socks are way, way smaller than marked."
2.0,Definitely smaller sizes. I bought 2 sizes too big and it was still too small
2.0,Muy lindas las cadenas pero muy pequeñas no parece de mujer sino de niñas<br />En cuanto al material es muy pronto para opinar a penas compre hace una semana
2.0,Nose pads fell off within days. Now they’re just bare metal resting on your nose bridge.
2.0,The shirt is shorter than expected.
2.0,Hat quality is good.  Really crappy screen printed logo.  Not even fully screen printed...
2.0,"I wore it once to be Cindy Lou who at work. I walked around for a bit in it. Then the ribbon that tied it closed in the front unraveled and came away from the material, leaving the cape useless!"
2.0,"I really liked these at first, comfortable and easy to use. However one of the two gel packs didn't even last a couple hours, it got a hole in it and leaked blue gel all over. Considering my testicles aren't covered in spikes, I'm not sure how that even happened. Great concept, but the fact it didn't even last for one day makes it useless. Save your money from this overpriced marketing ploy and use a bag a frozen peas. If I ever pull a Michael Scott and snip snap snip snap snip snap, then I'll make sure to stock up on frozen peas."
2.0,Go bigger on the size.
2.0,They are not what I wanted. I assumed at least one of the balls was removable so I could put it on like an earring but I guess I'm suppose to wear them as cuffs? I don't like this at all.
2.0,I am going to keep it.  I rarely send things back anyway.  Material  is extremely thin and quite clingy.  I will wear it over a bathing suit and then end of summer I will wear it to sleep …. Not a dress as described - more like a top for over leggings at best
2.0,Way to tight. Could not wear it for more than a few minutes without it starting to hurt.
2.0,Quality is poor and necklaces is weak
2.0,"Completely see-through :( the size was perfect, XL fit great and wasn’t over stretched, but you could still see my entire butt before I even did one squat. Total bummer!"
2.0,"I ordered larg but I am a mid size , still sleeves are a bit short and when I raise my hands up it is tight.. Looks better on line than in reality. Got here faster than expected."
2.0,This is another item that looks better online than in person. The actual material looks and feel cheap. It doesn't look flattering unless you're a size zero ( ordered a medium)
2.0,Looked like a tent on me
2.0,The material is really soft and comfortable. the arms are too tight. you may need to order a bigger size
2.0,Will return heel is uncomfortable
2.0,"Buy a size a bigger size If you like but in advance, this material does feel like a washing cloth from the inside"
2.0,Polyester & see through
2.0,"Very difficult to get on and off. After putting them on, my husband noticed there was a hole in one. Since he had worn them, I wasn’t able to return them.<br />However, they worked very well to ease his discomfort. So we will be ordering another pair and hopefully will not find a hole."
2.0,The product has only 1 size. For me it was not a match and I returned them.
2.0,looks weird on me it's dirty and some of the paint is coming off
2.0,Did not hold up against everyday use.
2.0,These look like they came out of a bubble gum machine. No kidding.
2.0,Dress fix perfectly well but came with a torn. I am disappointed
2.0,I felt like a parachute and had to roll them for them to fit. I even used the size chart
2.0,This hat is apiece of garbage! Loses its shape..strings coming out of it. Wish I had sent it back
2.0,"Loved the belt while it lasted, but after about six months of only occasional use the buckle broke and made it useless. I have another brand of this type of belt with a better buckle design. I'm now in need of another black belt, but I will purchase the other brand since it's more reliable."
2.0,Good quality but size not accurate.  Also looking for attach bra support. Description was not much to better understand the kind of sport shirt presented.
2.0,Doesn't fit comfortably.
2.0,It tarnished immediately. And turned my finger green.
2.0,"Overall the dress is nice, good fabric, it stretches where there needs to be stretch. If you have a more chunkier child whose in like plus size clothes stick to older juniors or women's clothing. This was to small/short in the front for my 10year old."
2.0,"Arms are strange lengths, texture of fabric is a little strange as well… was hoping to like this a lot but unfortunately that is not the case."
2.0,Waste of money. Very very cheap quality
2.0,I thought it was going to be on the heavier side I wouldn't use it for anything but a one shot deal
2.0,Was not as sheer as it looked in the pic. Way too much sequin for me...looked like something for someone older...like in their 50's. Definitely not something to wear with a material that pulls easily...it will mess it up.
2.0,"Looked better in photos, looked cheesy when received."
2.0,It was pretty cheap looking when I tried it on
2.0,"These are very very flimsy, I know they wouldn’t last long and the designs don’t look very good either. These would likely break and fall off easily."
2.0,"It was too short, and didn't look the same as a online, size was a little small I had to return it."
2.0,Fit was somewhat large and thus looked like pajamas on me.  The solid turquoise color was a little different than the turquoise in the floral skirt.  I am 5'7&#34; and it was too short on me.
2.0,"I got the opportunity to review this bracelet and I want to be straight up honest because everything I purchase online I go by peoples reviews so I want to return the favor. I received this recently I was very excited because I also make Christian jewelry, it did come very well packaged but when I opened the box all that was in it was the bracelet in a plastic sleeve. The part to size this wasn’t in the box but the box was sealed So giving this an honest opinion on wearability is tough because I like a snug fit and this as it is slides up and down my forearm. This looks to be very well built as you can see in the pictures along with the placement of the magnets it also has very good weight to it doesn’t feel cheap at all. What disappoints most of all is the cross that is on the bracelet  it looks very cheap and even if this bracelet fit me I wouldn’t wear it because of this I truly thought it would be engraved but it’s just a sticker. It must have a coating on it it doesn’t seem to peel but it’s just the point why make something so sturdy built and top it off with a sticker? All in all would I recommend this? This missing parts was a disappointment but it doesn’t take away how well built this is. I cant though recommend this because I can’t get by how the cross is a sticker but everybody is different this is just my opinion. Thank you for reading my feedback."
2.0,"The sandals are very poorly made. The day I received them I couldn’t wait to them on my son and when I pulled off the Velcro on one of the shoes, it almost completely came off. The thread came out that was keeping the Velcro attached to the shoe. I think n can sew but when I pay for something, I expect it to come without any damages. I’m so disappointed."
2.0,"I really like the way this product is shaped to make it more breathable, it is easy to put on and is easily sizeable BUT the metal part that is used to secure the band RUSTS where it sits against your skin. Kinda gross. Covered it with nail polish which helped but honestly don't bother with this product."
2.0,The material is very light it was so flimsy... would not have purchased it
2.0,"well when i got it it bent instanty and turned my ear green, it was very upsetting. i do not recomend buying this item"
2.0,These look pretty but they'll fall apart the first time you try to put them in your ear they are not sturdy they're very cheaply made and not even worth the money.
2.0,Doesn't feel orthopedic and left slipper has dried glue on the inner side that is on the outside and inside of strap that rubs side of foot.
2.0,"Love the dress,  short of a few significant flaws.  First thing I noticed - the inside liner is sewn inside out,  with seams and tags on the outside.  Wow,  but not terribly noticeable, would have kept it for that.  The empire waist was not exactly flattering with the way the gathering was done on the skirt,  but that might have been remedied by dewrinkling it,  which I didn't do. Would have kept it anyway.  But the zipper... the zipper was hard to zip,  seemed cheap,  especially around the empire waist and husband thought it was just to tight until I showed him how cheap the zipper feels and difficulty zipping up after I took it off.  I don't think the zipper will last very long.  Still would have kept it. After debating whether to keep it or not,  I finally told hubby I think I'm going to return it, THEN HE TELLS ME,  at the top of my neck,  the dress stood away from my neck about an inch and a half and looked kinda weird.  Any one or two of those issues, I probably would have kept it, even with the risk of the zipper because it fit great.  But there were just too many adding up.  Very sad,  because otherwise I LOVE THE DRESS 😔"
2.0,The picture looks alot better than the product. It was cheaply made
2.0,"These did not fit the size chart at all - they are very thin fabric, with a bit of give, but they definitely don't fit."
2.0,Was to small for me so I gave it away
2.0,Material is thin and see through. You will need to wear an under shirt.  Definitely made in China so it’s sizing is off. Make sure you read the description to find your correct size. The print is high quality and will last a while it seems.
2.0,They don’t pull my old babies up. The squish them together and they can’t breathe
2.0,"Pictures look much better than product which is borderline trash, especially with those blow holes. Do yourself a favor and get the Under Armour Mask which is thick, soft, comfy and well made. This is garbage."
2.0,Its cute but its way to big my mom has to fix it  so it will fit me one size fits all is BS. I was super sad its so huge.
2.0,I must've dug through the description so many times before I bought this to ensure this was cotton and it certainly wasn't. I live in Jamaica and there are only 3-4 months out of the year when its cool so I needed cotton PJs and thats not what I got. The fabric was polyester and sleeping in these at nights were hell! The shirt was too short and the shorts kept curling up under my butt.
2.0,a couple mm to small for my glasses.
2.0,These are so much bigger than the single packs. It barely stays on my face.
2.0,Came with scratches and dings all over the pendant and the necklace itself would only fit around a wrist so now in order to even wear it like a necklace I have to cut off the existing string and by a separate chain to go around it
2.0,Quick shipping but BOTH broke within a few weeks of using them
2.0,"I was very disappointed in the fit of the rashgaurd. It was way too big . I bought a meadium size and it was just frumpy ,nothing like beachwear. It was more like a tennis shirt."
2.0,"I would give this product a higher rating if it weren't for the fact that it does not match the description. The description specifically states this is a 6-clip set of suspenders/braces. However, it is actually a 3-clip set. The quality of the product itself seems decent."
2.0,"I am a size 7 ring, and bought a size 7 ring. These are snug. I tried wearing them at work for a day and couldn't last. I started losing circulation to my finger. I am a CNA and in nursing school. I thought this would be a practical replacement for my engagement ring which I don't want to lose or &#34;dirty up&#34; on the job. Unfortunately they are unwearable."
2.0,Size up 3 sizes. 5xl=2xl at best. Odd fabric texture.
2.0,"Was amazing at first, very comfortable since they’re essentially Wiimote straps<br /><br />BUT<br />Cheaply and terribly made, I rarely use VR and when I did finally start getting back into it the strap came clean off from the bottom part of the strand, don’t bother with these cheap straps if you’re playing regularly"
2.0,I returned the dress. It is pretty but not for me. I was looking for a dress for a wedding and I felt like the mother of the bride.
2.0,Weird fabric. Seems cheap and fits loosely
2.0,Cheaply made! The only good thing about this cap is that it says Martin on it! Comes all crumpled up in a plastic envelope. Material is thin no crown cardboard or plastic...
2.0,The color is nice but the material is rough like paper and the breast area is totally not supportive..
2.0,"They fit well but the material covering your foot is extremely scratchy! Other than that, they’re cute and seem decent."
2.0,"Too tight has no stretch at all. I struggled to put it on and take it off. It was cute, but annoying to wear."
2.0,I wont buy this again because it turns.
2.0,Material is awful and the fit is really boxy. Gave it to my 12 year old.
2.0,"Bought these for my son to wear under his football helmet to keep sweat out of his eyes.  The measurements said they were 2"" tall - not even close.  These are the hairbands that women use to hold their hair back.  Would have no use, and are not appropriate in my opinion for sweat or for men to use at all.  Would send back but my wife loved them and took them...see what I mean?"
2.0,I was hoping that they would last longer but they all broke within a few weeks of constant wear.
2.0,Love the look but broke very quickly!
2.0,Wish I was small enough to wear oriental sized dresses
2.0,They squished my glasses on to my face. Made them uncomfortable. Returned. Other than that seemed ok. Maybe if you wore them without glasses they would be ok. My years old Scott goggles do not do this.
2.0,"Not sure how these are made for adult men....they're really narrow, and basically fit my 6 year old son perfectly."
2.0,I wanted to live these but these hurt my ears
2.0,"As soon as we received the package, we opened and hung up the dress for the future event. When the person the dress was bought for put it on, we noticed a small hole (the size of a half dollar) in the lace by one of the black straps. Overall it was pretty dress and fit mostly as expected, especially in length."
2.0,Shirt is closer to yellow
2.0,"Super cut looking, unfortunately the buttons pop off very easily and they don't last very long."
2.0,"Didn't like it,  won't buy it again"
2.0,Thin!
2.0,"I probably should have gotten the next size, Ordered a different suit. I am keeping this to wear when I loose some weight. Didn't like the the one piece, hard to get into. New one is 2 piece and much better."
2.0,I purchased the shirt and it had some glue marks and the insignia badge was a little tacky... well I gave it as a gift for my boyfriend and he re-did it and changed out the badge and etc... the shirt material is really good and he is very happy.
2.0,"On one page it says the masked rider is there but he isn't. I went over every single inch of the page and he's just not there. Also on several pages he doesn't actually look like what the example to find looks like. Also some items that you're supposed to find, such as a bag of popcorn, may be in the picture but they've &#34;hidden&#34; the items behind other pictures so much you can't tell if they're actually there or not."
2.0,Was broke when I got it fixed it and broke somewhere else not worth the money
2.0,"Felt like...foam rubber, like what you would wrap glasses in if you moved?  I wish it was softer jersey like material, I would have probably loved it.  Decided it would be good for an 80s costume (if I ever needed one), but ultimately donated it because it wasn’t a keeper."
2.0,"Disappointed at the price, found the same shorts at a cheaper price on the Shein app"
2.0,"Cute shirt, great colors, runs smallish but seriously DRY CLEAN ONLY?!<br />Never would have bought if I knew this"
2.0,The silver pictured on the website is NOT the silver I received.  This is more of a grey metallic which I wish would have been explained.  Medium Silver and the picture still do not look at all as the same color. A bit disappointed.
2.0,Not for ppl who wear glasses. The cuffs are a little big. It is adorable tho.
2.0,The material loosens up too much. No tummy control at all.
2.0,I bought these to make Fall/Halloween earrings with and was super excited to get them. I was very disappointed to pull them out and have the stems fall off the pumpkins. Hoping that my jewelry glue will be strong enough to hold them together so that I can still use them! :(
2.0,"I love the color and textures of these sandals. The pictures in advertisement are exact. The sandals are very lightweight, bottom are made of plastic. The best way to describe the bottom is that they feel like styrofoam encased in plastic or even sprayed with some kinda thin plastic. Although bottom is tough its a has a bit more squish and flexibility than I like. The product just doesn't carry the quality I'd expect even with a $10 price tag. In sandals I can wear a 7- 7.5 which was selected. The bottom of the shoe states 39-40 (made in china) I assume are UK size. If I read correctly that's more of a size 9 in USA. Perhaps the seller thought they were selling to Great Britain. I didn't contact seller, no need to waste my time further."
2.0,Too small Sent back
2.0,Looked pretty dull
2.0,Sorry. Just OK...DKM
2.0,Good fit except for one pant leg is shorter than the other. I didn't expect to get factory rejects form such a  popular company as amazon.
2.0,"Not a good fit, was baggy. I'm 5'2&#34; 120<br />Returned it...."
2.0,"Women's clothing sizes are a complete mess. I'm a 2 in most stores if not a 0 so I ordered a 4 in this and it was far too small, still."
2.0,"This dress is ok, some what large. I returned it the next day, the material is nice and soft; over all this dress just wasn't for me.."
2.0,"im not really sure im going to wear these, they look like they were slapped together really fast with glue on the seams. not impressed"
2.0,It’s cute but too small I ordered a larger size for my daughter still too small short in length but it’s cute
2.0,They look exactly like the picture which I loved. But they are so heavy on my ears it makes it very hard to wear them.
2.0,"I bought them because they look fluffy in the photo, but the fur was a little but of everywhere and you could see the metal bits where it attaches. And they catch in the hair."
2.0,"I am disappointed with the quality of these earrings.  I bought them in gold and silver.  They do not lay on your ears as shown in the picture, they feel like they're made out of plastic and the finish is really cheap looking.  I am returning these."
2.0,Quality of fabric feels great but they ride up my leg annoyingly. Had to return
2.0,It's a different material than what it looks like in the picture. I thought it would be all cotton but it's not.  Guess I should have read a little further.  It fits a little small. If I could return it in the store I would and it took a long time to get here
2.0,"This should advertise as misses, not women's. It is way too small and the lace is way more messy than formal."
2.0,"I ordered my usual shirt size, large tall, and the shirts I received fit like a medium through the chest and the arm holes were way too high. The quality is not in line with the price of the shirts, either. The material is thin and feels like it would shrink a lot when washed. For what I paid, I was expecting Carhartt quality but the shirts I received felt like $20 or $25 shirts. These are going back."
2.0,"Not good quality, very sheer and the material is not comfortable."
2.0,"The Earrings were beautiful; however, unlike the picture depicts by the Seller, the earrings were way too long and rested past my collarbone and sat below my collarbone. I am returning to Amazon for a refund."
2.0,You can see through the top to the round cushions
2.0,I got this a while ago expecting that it would be this certain item and hoping that the packages got mixed up but it turned out to be something completely different.
2.0,"Too thin for winter socks. Loose, doesn't stay up well."
2.0,"This was a classic case where the product worked until days after the return window and there is absolutely no information available to contact the manufacturer.  The only redeeming factor about this vest is that it is a really nice quilted vest for the price.  Too bad the vest doesn't heat.<br /><br />I've tried three different USB power packs on this vest, all rated for 2.1A output.  The vest turns on for a minute or so.  Just as you think there might be a hint of warmth, the vest turns off and will not turn on again.<br /><br />I new the price was ""too good"" when I ordered it, but expected it would at least last a year or so.  No such luck.  I only gave it two stars because it is still a functional vest."
2.0,"I love the bright color and the fabric, it's soft and warm at the same time... but the fit is just awful!<br />I am 5'8"" and 120lbs, I got a medium and it was super large around the hips, but short arms and legs. So short I couldn't raise my arms. Had to return it. I wish they made a better fit."
2.0,Fits smaller then described
2.0,So I ordered an XL and fit more like a small. Not sure where this thing was made but I was very disappointed in this product couldn't even get it over my calves.
2.0,The clasp mechanism is very weak and does not fasten well. One or both sides of the clasp will disengage with minimum movement and or pressure. Other than that the watch band is as described.
2.0,"Size wise, a little big.  However, this fabric and fit is NOT compression."
2.0,My son loved it for 5 minutes till it broke.
2.0,"I was completely satisfied with this until this past weekend when the metal buckle fell off.  I was eating dinner and all the sudden my firbit fell off my wrist.  I looked and the buckle was gone, nowhere to be found.  I would give this a 5 star if not for that.<br />Comfort = 5<br />ease of use 5<br />Durability 2"
2.0,"Not what I expected. Cheap material, and is not well fitting. Will be returning."
2.0,"It is very cute and it'll work, but it SMELLS AWFUL!!!! I am not sure I am going to be able to even use it because of the strong chemical smell of China.  🤢"
2.0,"So I bought 2 colors I got this one as a XXL. But it fits like an American medium.  I ordered another color in a large that arrived the same day, and the Large fit better.  But this one the XXL was really tight..... which makes no sence since I ordered them from the same company.<br /> The flower fabric is a stretchy thin material that is white on the inside so when it stretches AT ALL it looks see through (and slightly is).  I might as well have ordered this off of wish.  Super disappointed because I loved the flower print.  Only reason it gets 2 stars is because I like the blue one which fits more appropriately"
2.0,"Doesn't stay in place, it rolls up on top of the ladies!"
2.0,I thought these were so cute so I bought 2 for mom and me. The hats are adorable but the face shield is a soft plastic that was folded. I am really trying to flatten the wrinkles in the face shield but I'm not sure it's going to happen. Also the face shield fogs from your breath.
2.0,"I've been looking for the perfect dress with pockets for ages, and I had high hopes that this would be it. Unfortunately, it's just 'off'.<br /><br />First, it was big on me. I usually wear a size 6/8 in tops, 10/12 in bottoms. The size Medium was too big and hung in all the wrong ways. The size Small fit perfectly.<br /><br />First, the pros:<br />- I really like the fabric - it's a thickly knit cotton with just a bit of stretch.<br />- The deep pocket fits my phone, even in a slightly bulky case.<br />- Once I sized down, it fit well with nothing in the pockets.<br /><br />The cons:<br />- The pocket that's in the small of the back is useless. It's hard to reach, and the &#34;hidden&#34; zipper sticks out in a way that's noticeable in profile.<br />- The zippered pocket doesn't fit my passport with a case on it without sticking out in a very obvious way.<br />- I have large hips, and once I put my phone, passport, and wallet in the pockets the dress becomes very unflattering.<br /><br />Lastly, the 'black' color isn't actually black. It's off-black, or maybe a very dark navy. It's not very obvious on its own, but as soon as I tried pairing it with black tights or a black blazer the color difference was very noticeable.<br /><br />I decided not to keep it. With a few small changes, it would be perfect -- but this iteration doesn't meet my needs."
2.0,They fit as expected but unfortunately never made it to the event without running.
2.0,Not very pleased with this watch!  No way to contact company in regards to watch!  I guess  I should have known better buying a name brand watch id never heard of before!?  It runs 15 minutes fast for every 48 hours.  It has beautiful movements and looks but mot worth the price tag!
2.0,Thin material and very short.
2.0,Shrunk too much and did not hold shape.
2.0,I ordered the wine it is more like mauve. I ordered one before and really liked it but somehow this fits different. My first one says 2xl for size and this says xxl and the arms are tigheter. Im sending it back. I wish they had more colors in the bigger sizes....because I woukd order more just one size up.
2.0,"While this dress is very pretty, the material is very thin & would require a full slip."
2.0,The material is so light-weight it is transparent.  Not classy.
2.0,Really nice but clamp is way too hard to take on and off. I’ve never been able to take it off without asking for help from someone. Too bad...It’s really nice.
2.0,I had to send this back. It is a fairly nice but way too small.  The Large is actually about a size small.
2.0,Dress is quite clingy as the fabric is really cheap - wore it to work and had to keep pulling it down and the slip up - when it arrived had to take it to cleaner to have it pressed as it was unwearably wrinkled - guess its okay for the money but have better fitting $8 Old Navy dresses
2.0,Only issue is the blue color numbers on my black blue watch are hard to see... i should o ordered the yellow black design.. The EL LED display is also not very bright.. visible only at night.  Would been a go to watch... but will most likely give away.
2.0,"This is a long shirt, not a dress"
2.0,Thee large are at best medium. This item is more for petite women not big guys like me.
2.0,Wrong fit by far
2.0,"So disappointed. Couldn't wait to get this vest & received with chipped zipper paint and zipper very difficult to zip up, whether on or off. Maybe I just got a lemon? Love everything else about it.  Sadly, I'm returning it.  Further, got refunded for cost of vest $35, but not $7.25 shipping.  Don't appreciate that in terms of poor customer service.  Will avoid this seller for future purchases."
2.0,Bought xl was too small so returned it for xxl and it’s the same size so again too small and also too thin of fabric
2.0,"This did not come with a box, it's not the right size and is too big for any of my fingers, it's also not as detailed like in the picture but still nice looking."
2.0,The color (plum) was lighter than I thought... I'm 5'3 and for it to look right on me I have to wear it high waisted....
2.0,Very thin metal frames that easily bend.
2.0,Broke within a week of receiving them. My son is so sad.
2.0,This top runs very small.
2.0,came to small and it is an extra larg
2.0,Boots fell apart and she was able to RIP off jewels
2.0,"Fit is smaller than expected. It is made for fit, slim, but not sticky fit."
2.0,They all broke within a month. Thay are cheap and I won't recommend them for anyone.
2.0,"The size says one size fits.  Fits what,  a twig?  My sister who is a size small  fit in it,  but it won't fit a medium.  It is a shame.  It is a beautiful shirt."
2.0,When I opened the box all the beads fell out. It wasn't sewed all the way closed.
2.0,"I bought this for my husband who was in a motorcycle accident.  He said it was uncomfortable, especially because he could *feel* the snaps that go down the side.  He said feeling them against his skin was annoying.  Additionally, he said the material was not very soft--- felt like hospital scrubs."
2.0,"These boots were delivered on March 25. It is now April 27 and the soles are splitting in half. These are my daughter's favorite boots and she has worn them frequently, but only to school. I would have hoped they would have lasted longer."
2.0,Product made at least 3 sizes too small. Well made though.
2.0,"I have a wide head/face so I've been looking for large sunglasses for years. These things are weird. They are very tall, yet aren't super wide.  If you have a really long/tall face these may fit you. The do not fit wide faces though."
2.0,"Very flimsy, thought it would be sexy/ cute but just looked cheap and awkward."
2.0,it didn't fit around my glasses so I returned items
2.0,"I returned this product, it just felt cheap to me"
2.0,Pretty but no tummy control
2.0,"Looked good but whatever it is made out of.. is just horrible material to me. Taking out and putting back in my tracker constantly is too tough to what the real brand bracelets is and it just ended up falling apart from that. To me, it's made for looks. NOT to be used."
2.0,It was way too big and looked nothing like the picture.
2.0,"So cheaply made, looks cheap wish I wouldve took pics."
2.0,I didn’t realize it would be made of that somewhat shiny material that clings to you. Would probably look great on someone thinner than me.
2.0,"Disappointed in my purchase. When tightening the straps so it wouldn’t be too low, the plastic tightener on the straps broke.<br />I actually never got to wear it. Looks cute in the picture but when it actually arrived I was underwhelmed."
2.0,This suit was so cute but as other reviewers stated the butt was way too big.this suit was so cute I was tempted to keep it but knowing how a swimsuit gets bigger when wet I knew it would sag in the butt way too much. If you are pear shaped this suit is for you.
2.0,Definitely not worth the price the skirt is stiff and looks terrible and the bow fell apart before she even got to wear it. The leg warmers don’t fit right they are tight in some spots and too big in the other and the spiders stick together. The only thing I like about the outfit is the onesie.
2.0,poor quality did not fit as expected.
2.0,I was able to return them.
2.0,My old robe from Miss Elaine is showing the wear  because  I have worn it so often.  I was excited to find a new one listed on Amazon but it is totally different.  It has a dolman type of sleeve that is not flattering to a fuller body and it ran a little small.  I sadly had to return this item and continue to wear my old one.  Guess that means Miss Elaine makes a durable product lol.  Will wait for the next season and hope that is kinder to a fuller figure like my old one.
2.0,Not as dry as they say ! They fit comfortable but I was  looking for something that stayed drier on humid hot days .
2.0,"This is a decent dress for around the pool if you aren't in the sun too much.  (Polyester doesn't ""breathe"" and can feel much warmer than other fabrics in hot weather.)  It looks very cute on the product page, but just looks and feels cheap in person.  The elastic works find for keeping it up.  I may get some use for it around the house, but it is not something I would wear to a pool party or a casual picnic or barbecue.  It is ""currently unavailable"" at the time I'm posting this review, so be sure to comparison shop if it becomes available and you want to give it a try."
2.0,"I ordered this jacket and an Amazon's essentials full zip hoodie. The Amazon hoodie was softer and warmer! I kept the Amazon hoodie, sent the Chigant back!! I was disappointed with this Chigant hoodie quality. For the price China could have used a bit more material and had the quilt design line up straight in the front. That's what made it look cheap. The cuffs and bottom band were cheap material, looked like it was stretched out already. The hood came all the way down to my chin. Made for a gigantic head. The fit and color black were the only nice thing about it."
2.0,"While this fits well, it is poorly made, & with fabric on the bottom half that I wouldn’t have used. It’s a mix between jersey knit on top & satin like material on bottom. The whole thing should have been Jersey. Wouldn’t buy again!"
2.0,"It fits great and was really cute at first, but the paw print pattern started fading and running off within just a few days."
2.0,Really sad because my wallet came stained too. :( ill try to clean it but will return if I cant.<br />I like how sturdy it is its large but skinny. Fits cards dont use cash much but there is pockets you can place cash or receipts in.
2.0,only meant for small ears not for normal people
2.0,Arrived ripped.  A gift for my Sis.  So disappointed.
2.0,beautify but poor quality - the colors bleed?
2.0,I had to return it because the face of the watch was crooked.
2.0,B's and under only.
2.0,"IT'S  just not my style, but I'm sure<br />others will like it."
2.0,"i bought this try on it, the price is great, but the build material using very cheap plastic, and it's very think. i don't feel safe wearing it on my bike."
2.0,thought the details were going to be bigger.
2.0,Too clingy for my body shape.
2.0,"Great quality and heavy, good quality material but fits much smaller than expected (and I sized up). VERY short and does not stretch at all."
2.0,"Did not care for this watch. I had a beautiful pocket watch from Avalon that was bigger, and more substantial. It did not have a cover, and did not have the roman numerals. I loved it and it was stolen during a house viewing. I have never been able to find that particular model again so I tried this one, but it is smaller, making it harder to read, and the winder is incorporated with the lid latch so it doesn't wind easily and makes a rough noise. It does keep time OK, but it definitely doesn't compare to the one I had."
2.0,Seemed a bit generic and cheap.  Didn't like the cut of the jean- long waisted and crotchy
2.0,"I must have skinny legs, but this seemed too big on me and kept sliding down. Pretty though, if I can keep them in place."
2.0,I love the look after I changed out the string that would hold it on my face as you can see. This had a better look but I accidently dropped it and it broke in half and as you can see broke off a fang! I'm going to try to glue it back together.
2.0,"Loved it when I first wore it, got a lot a compliment.  After washing it was all wrinkled so I steamed it and it looked good but didn't drape as nicely as when I first got it. I ended up catching it on my chain and ripped a hole in it :(  Am not replacing it."
2.0,"Its very cheaply made but its still cute, but still it stains your finger easily.............. SO yeah guess so soo"
2.0,Like but too big
2.0,I don't like the noise piece and to big
2.0,Loved the color and ordered one size up and it's still a little snug. Not true to size
2.0,Followed sizing instructions but still too large.  Didn't activate my phone's touch screen reliably.<br />Returned.
2.0,This item is cute but looks like it may be sized for a baby that has gotten their ears pierced for the first time. If your looking for earrings for and adult or a child even then these earrings aren’t the ones for you. Suitable for babies only.
2.0,"Unless I am built weird the underarms have huge gaps. Honestly, I might be built weird!! I ordered a small. The color and pattern was really cute!"
2.0,Cheap material. Had yo return it
2.0,Says &#34;unisex&#34; but totally looks boyish. Not for a female at all! My daughter NEVER was able to wear. Giving away to a boy.
2.0,"I purchased the clear view masks. They were very comfortable, BUT the description said a 4-pk. Unfortunately, I only received a 2-pk. As a result, I returned them."
2.0,I’m 5’10” and this was so long I could hardly reach the zipper bottom. Came horribly wrinkled as it’s in a wadded up ball inside a bag.  But the worst part was the color. Baby crap brownish yellow. Worst than those Carhartt coats. Item arrived quickly which is about all I can say nice.
2.0,Colors do NOT match the picture. I ordered midnight blue and pine green. I received dark navy and mint green
2.0,"Super thin, rough material. Had a hole in them before my daughter ever wore them. They were cute, but the thin material meant they could only be worn under a dress or something. My daughter only wore them once because she didn’t like the roughy material. Fit small."
2.0,"Very thin material, you could see right through it."
2.0,"I only wore this for about an hour before the clasp completely broke. Good for pictures, but not for functionality."
2.0,These are soooo adorable!!! They have beautiful embroidery and a few sequins for shine. They run about a half size too small. They are canvas and won't stretch. I'm a size 9 and I ordered size 40. I'm returning and buying a bigger size.
2.0,The straps were way too long and the skirt was way too short. It worked for Christmas pictures with some alterations to the straps but looked silly when she walked around and you could see her bum
2.0,Theoretically this would be a great combo to have the length of the biker shorts covered by the loose fit of running shorts. Reality is that the running shorts stick out like a weird tutu.  I meant to send back but missed the deadline.  So found the perfect use for these….gardening shorts.
2.0,Bottom of the dress is cheap. Too black did not match the bottom
2.0,My item did come fast but the stone is very tiny and one of the earnings came with no back on it... I have other backs but it should have had it .
2.0,"This hat looks nice, but it won't last more than 1 wear.  It is very poorly made."
2.0,"I don't know if it was just poor construction or what, but the purse is like sticky with the glue that was used to hold the sequins down. So when you are holding it, your hands get a bit tacky. I will probably end up returning this because the smell and stickness of the glue just are not what I was expecting and could cause damage to an evening dress."
2.0,This outfit was too small that I didn't bother to try it on my baby. Look like it was made for a doll baby. Way too small and not even stretchy. I had to return.
2.0,"Poor quality, fraying after a couple of uses."
2.0,These suits are very cute and fit well but the fabric is very poor quality. It feels more like a costume than a bathing suit. I didn't feel it would last even one wash or swim so I returned them.
2.0,"Two of the packages arrived torn open. Makes me think these were returns, perhaps worn. UGH!"
2.0,"It runs small. I have a small to average sized wrist and could not get it to close around my wrist without being tight and uncomfortable. It looks like a child's size. The bracelet itself is pretty, but the round stones do not lay flat, they are raised above the rest of the stones in an odd way."
2.0,They actually hurt to walk!
2.0,Looks cheap. Wouldn’t recommend.
2.0,"I went off their product sizing chart. And it's huge. I am going to have it altered. Fabric is okay, it is thin. If it fit, I'm sure it would be great blouse. I ordered a medium black and it fits like an extra large."
2.0,I loved this watch band. It fit perfect and easy to install on Apple Watch. The only bad thing is that the first time I wore it the gold tone color looks like it was a coating of paint and it keeps chipping off the bolo  dangling chain that’s for adjusting wristband onto my skin and now the chain is a copper color instead of matte gold. If it wasn’t for this it would be the perfect watch band
2.0,"This is definitely a light jacket. It's more like a sweater made out of jacket material. I ordered a size up, which allowed it to fit properly. I am returning it, however, because I expected the jacket to be burgundy and received a cherry red jacket labeled as burgundy. I took a picture by the window so that others could see the real color."
2.0,Tarnished very quickly. Only wore a few times.
2.0,Horrible quality very cheap does not fit. Even if it did fit wouldn't look Good. The bottoms are OK but the top was mainly my issue
2.0,Was supposed to get one with skulls on it.  Istead I got one that looks like stars and outerspace.  I ordered for the skulls.  I don't appreciate bait and switch
2.0,Cute concept but thin and meh material.
2.0,Unless the decor in the middle is REALLY small or moveable you probably won't be able to get them in.
2.0,"Dress fits well at waist and chest but length is short, I’m 5’6 and dress falls mid thighs. Also if you wear a dark color underwear it will show through the white dress."
2.0,They do not hold for a long period of time and if you have bigger breasts they do not hold at all
2.0,Great material looks amazing but it’s more for 5-10 years of age and not adults
2.0,I have a short torso so i had my Aunt take in the mid section because when i would bend over the middle looked weird. I wanted it to fit tight to my body. Also order a bigger size than what you would normally wear. Also I did notice imperfections and some parts uneven. Otherwise it was a nice suit.
2.0,"It's advertised as genuine leather, but once received, it was clear that it was some sort of faux leather material.  Also the picture does not match the product received.  In the photo it shows that the word &#34;Passport&#34; is embossed in the front.  The product received does not have that, instead it has the brand embossed on the front.  I loved the layout of the passport holder, but disappointed that the product received was different than the product advertised and photographed."
2.0,Some of my earrings were broken upon arrival.. overall cheap
2.0,"""Not my thing"" the wife reported. So it's difficult to write a review since she plans on donating it on the next clothing drive. I will say that it came in packaging that was too large. OTOH, it folds neatly and would be nice for travel (the use I had intended for my wife).Seems to be functional, but make sure you know that this is a visor, and not a hat."
2.0,"This dress looks like a cheap knock off of the picture of the actual dress. The material is so cheap that I’m embarrassed to wear it. I’ll have to find some way to make it look decent. It’s a shame because I’ve had this dress on my wishlist for some time as I went back and forth with whether I should buy it or not. If you’re wondering, don’t buy it."
2.0,"Surprised to have it come in bag right from China, would not have ordered if known. Although I like the look and feel, the XX ordered was too small.I'm 6'2 & most XX fit right, this was too tight. But then upon washing it shrank another 40% !"
2.0,"Gorgeous shawl. However, it &#34;sheds&#34; like a glittery fuzz that will COVER everything you wear it with. Just awful. So far I've worn it once and now I just don't feel like looking like I'm covered in glitter."
2.0,"I think the quality of this bag was well worth the price.  But, I really dislike the colors (grey and yellow) of the big and I will be returning it tomorrow."
2.0,Do not buy this watch. It looks great and my son loved it but some internal pieces broke within the first week of having it. We exchanged it for another exactly like it and had the exact same problem. We returned it and were charged an Item Promotion Deduction of $1.30 & a Restocking Fee  of $4.94. This is not consistent with the statement “free returns”. Save yourself the hassle and keep looking for a different watch.
2.0,It is A LOT smaller than you would think<br />But it is very cute
2.0,Faux Leather had a smell to it; but I washed it in cold water with some fabric softener liquid and the smell was gone.  It is not too hot and it does hold me in which is what I wanted to give my body some definition and shape.
2.0,"These are lightweight and cute. Unfortunately, one is assembled backwards and I did not realize it until I was out with friends and someone pointed it out. I am returning for a replacement so I hope the new pair is correct!"
2.0,Nice idea but image is not crisp colors a tad muddy
2.0,"These shoes were super comfortable. Lightweight and really nice to walk around with. Good and durable.<br /><br />I bought these in January 2021. But by April 2021, the soles got so slick that I slip if I step in water. I don't even walk that much at work, I either drive a forklift or sit in my office.<br /><br />These shoes are only good for a really short time. Like 3 Months. Anything more, don't get your hopes up."
2.0,Did not look like the sweater on the model as advertised. Not impressed. Ordered in two colors and ask that both be returned b/c wasn’t what I was expecting.
2.0,"Not quite as expected. There is a section of fabric matching the wide part of the tie on the skinny end which defeats the purpose of a 'contrast tie' in my opinion. Delivery was fairly prompt, sooner than the estimated dates on Amazon, so props there. Other than that, it's a tie and it was fairly inexpensive, seems decent in and of itself."
2.0,Cancel this product because prize is too high
2.0,It's supposed to be easy to tell time in the dark with florescent green hour hands. Very difficult if not impossible to see in the dark.
2.0,Was just looking for a simple white t-shirt which did not allow visibility of my under garment. Well the material allowed a view which is not desired.  Wear around the house.  It fits a little snug so if you like a loose fit you may want a size up.
2.0,"Made of great soft material, however when receiving a xxl, it was still too small."
2.0,i like the color but socks seem to be cheaply made
2.0,Totally see through.
2.0,these are fairly thin and dainty. I was expecting them to make a little more of a statement but you really couldn't even see them through my hair. Pretty small!
2.0,"Although they look like the pictures, they are dull, the ‘shapes’ are not distinguishable, and some are so enormous, I literally laughed out loud"
2.0,"If it wasn’t a Christmas gift it would be returned right away. Definitely looks like a fish with ears, but will leave that decision up to my daughter.  Obviously they made a flub in the making and are pawning them off on the buyers and hoping they won’t be returned, instead of doing the right thing and trashing them or putting up the appropriate picture of what you’re getting.  Yes, I’m seriously annoyed and gave it a 2 star ,only because despite being fishy looking it does look pretty."
2.0,Not at thick as I thought. Inside of pockets are ripping. Cute pattern but not a functional winter coat.
2.0,Was expecting a textured feel on the surface of the tie given what the image looked like in the display. Disappointed in that there was none.
2.0,"Unfortunately, the yellow scarf (the one I really wanted) had a red stain that was still present after spot-treating and laundering.<br /><br />It ended up being discarded!😩"
2.0,"Well, The item was defective upon receipt.  It works and looks good in general, but it has some kind of white glue or paint all over the seem  The package and or boxes were not damaged, so it must be a factory defect?  If seller responds and takes care of the issue I will gladly change my review stars."
2.0,The sleeves are extremely short for the sweater. Really disappointed.
2.0,"Fabric does not give, XL fit too tight."
2.0,Be wary! While the description does say navy blue the photo is a completely different shade. Sweater is very dark navy and I had to return it as this was not at all the color I needed.
2.0,This shirt was poor quality material and was way too big.
2.0,There were no clas to hook the strap in the back.
2.0,Too small for my head. Always pops up and does not keep my ears warm
2.0,"Runs small.  Not right.  Very clingy.  Shows all bumps and curves, including extra pounds."
2.0,Looks great. Shedding a bit.
2.0,The picture shows the leather part of the necklace to be a reddish color.  It's dark brown and so I don't like it. The color of the leaves show also to be a burnished color as well. They are bright gold. So the color doesn't match the picture.  Deceiving.
2.0,"Comfortable to wear, easy to install but didn't last long.  6months and fabric ripped.  Luckily I felt it went it fell off my wrist and saved my watch."
2.0,These leggings where too small. The back and front were the same.
2.0,I like the weight but the wrinkles are not coming out with a steamer.
2.0,Looked like crap
2.0,"The hat itself is cute, but it arrived folded flat and I have been unable to get the hard creases out. The fit is on the large side."
2.0,"Okay I guess for costume use.  Thin material, red color is not quite right.  Smelled like chemicals, but smell dissipated quickly."
2.0,Fits big but nice material
2.0,"This shirt is 95 polyester 5 spandex.  After the initial wash, (I hadn't even worn it yet), it was pilled so bad I had to use  a clothes shaver on it. Also, I have pets, and their hair seems to gravitate toward it. Do not recommend"
2.0,It arrived in two pieces and haven't been able to wear it until I get it fixed.
2.0,I just ordered several sleeping bottoms for my elderly father and I avoid white ones cause they are kinda nasty. I was satisfied with all except this batch. Look at the nasty white ones and then get 3 of them rather than the color blocked ones shown in the picture and you understand my disappointment. I was willing to accept one of the white ones with the 2 colored ones for the price and I expected to get what I ordered
2.0,I like the looks but the band is slick & the end slides loose from the retaining strap. Don't really recommend it.
2.0,"Loved this at first, but after my first washing the seams started splitting and it just kind of fell apart."
2.0,This wig is hallow so to get it to stand up you need to stuff it and then it falls left and right the whole time! I would pass!
2.0,I bought a small and it was large I have to fix it. The fabric is not good either
2.0,"The ends keep unscrewing while on and I lost parts within the first week.  Also if you have long hair and you use these in your ears it keeps getting twirled around in the earrings.  The ends were so hard to put on especially doing it by myself, I think a baby's hands would still be too big for them.  If I hadn't tried them for a week in hopes they'd work out I would return them."
2.0,"While these socks are size appropriate, they are not 20-30mmHg. There is barely any compression and for someone who NEEDS heavy compression, these were a major letdown."
2.0,"I Liked the suit but even the XL was way too small for me.  I'm 5'4&#34;, 145# & a 36D."
2.0,Did not fit as expected - too small!
2.0,It’s little bigger in size than normal<br />Size. Quality is ok
2.0,runs small. looks better on long thin torso.
2.0,"This product fits very well and is comfortable, unfortunately it started to fall apart at the seams after 2 washes.  It is not durable and I can't wear it right now unless I sew it."
2.0,"The front pocket had a hole inside pocket. Too much hassle to return since I already used and washed item. Quality control needs to check inside pockets to make sure there’s no defects. Oh well, this time I guess."
2.0,I didn’t have these very long and was pulling them on and the whole thing ripped apart
2.0,Sleeves too small. Material thin.
2.0,"This was a somewhat scratchy sweater.  Was not comfortable at all.  The bottom was not stretchy like most sweaters, but had an edge that was like a piece of string that wouldn’t stretch.  And the worst part was the massive neck on this thing.  I think it was for a giraff.  I could literally put the whole neck up over my head like a turtle.  Ended up returning it due to the giraffe neck."
2.0,This product is ridiculously SMALL. Thats why it was so cheap. I normally wear a woman’s small or medium. This extra large fits like a SMALL/MEDIUM. So beware of sizing issues. The shirt itself is awesome though.
2.0,The sleeves were not as shown in the picture. I got a quarter sleeve and not wrist length. I can not use it for the purpose it bought. The size runs small.
2.0,Its cute but not as cute as the picture shows. The color is much lighter and mainly purple
2.0,Disappointed.  Size is NOT true size fit.  Way too big.  Nicely made.  Would've loved them had they been true size fit.  Not reordering.  Don't have time to guess what MAY fit.
2.0,They are cute but came out and were bent very easily.
2.0,This watch was larger than I thought from the picture of it so I returned it. I also thought it looked like exactly what it cost.
2.0,like the feel but its way too small
2.0,"Nice but made me look big, to flowie"
2.0,Fit like a big diaper. Rubbed My upper inner thigh making it not feel good.
2.0,Very poorly made. Change came out of fastener right away.
2.0,"Delivery and service were excellent, but it seems like tee shirt fabric has gotten thinner and thinner in recent years.  These colored v-neck tees are every bit as thin as Fruit of the Loom underwear tees but at a much higher price. Where has good solid weight 100% cotton fabric gone?  It is hard to find v-neck tees in the tall sizes, so I am keeping these, but what a disappointment.  It would really help if venders would disclose the weight of the fabric that is being used."
2.0,My son wanted this thing so bad so I got it…he will not be wearing this costume in public! It is skin tight and very revealing for a boy…he would have to wear shorts over it.
2.0,Different material than picture
2.0,This is very pretty but it has a sharp barb on one of the edges that can cut into hand when you put the cuff on.
2.0,"The earrings were too big for my taste, but they were nice. I gave them away."
2.0,Funny. Thick cotton that's kindof scratchy. My main complaint is that the color is off and doesn't match the picture. My shirt has a red smear across the cats mouth and the flowers are white instead of pink. I wore it once and the collar started turning orange.
2.0,"Thus was very thin, very cheap material . Not likeva regular hoodie sweatshirt. Very small and short ."
2.0,don't care for these...the eye pockets are too flat; the elastic band stretches out too quickly and the material that covers the foam padding separated after only a couple uses. I've used other brands that I liked much better.
2.0,They are more like sweater tights than leggings. Pill so easily that I only can wear around the house.
2.0,Order 2 sizes up. Very small.
2.0,I woke up to all the plastic hooks and purses on the ground. Find a better constructed alternative
2.0,This is the only sulfur product I've used that expires and no longer works even well sealed. The liquids I've used work best but cannot be well contained and spoil and rust anything they are stored with. I'm thinking I will have to go with a gel or try harder at storing the liquid bottles now that I have a stationary studio. I had bought this thinking it would store well but it gave up.
2.0,"The bracelet and ring are nice enough, but the earrings wouldn’t fit into an average piercing. They’re HUGE posts, if that’s the correct term. You’d be gauging out your ears if you tried to put them in."
2.0,"Love the color.  I didn't like the fabric, so thin and clingy. Not what I expected.  I was going to returnit but decided to keep.  It makes a great nightgown. It is lightweight enough to sleep comfortably."
2.0,"Looks pretty in person, but the sizing is small.  It has to lay on your neck and decollate just perfectly.  It didn't work out for me"
2.0,I loved the color and the set up. But It is too big for my  for my time arm. I was very disaponted that I could not ware it because I was looking  forward too waring it.
2.0,Its way too big and way too thin. Not what I expected.
2.0,Too small for a 2X had to given it to my daughter who is small as he'll.
2.0,The caged part sits perfect on my chest. The bra part is super small and cuts my breast in half. I don't even have large breast! I am a small C cup and the size was for like an A
2.0,"The pants looks like the picture. The material feels like you are putting your leg inside a balloon. My daughter has sensory issues, so no way she’ll wear them. My older one will, and we will get the one time use out of them we planned on. Not good for anything long term."
2.0,Kind of hard to figure out how to make this look like the picture... it's also a weird fleece/wool texture that's too light to be either material.<br /><br />It feels pretty cheap and doesn't really look like the item described.
2.0,It fell off on the first day I used it. It looked pretty but only lasted half a day.
2.0,They are way shorter than expected
2.0,"Very pretty, but eye charm broke off first time I even wore it."
2.0,Quality didn’t seem great. The teeth looked cheap and wouldn’t wash well. Returned the item.
2.0,"Demasiado pequeña...no se ve como en la foto, pero la tela buena"
2.0,They broke like in 2 month
2.0,These sleeves were at least 5 inches too long. The shirt itself was nice but this shirt was designed for somebody else.
2.0,"Pretty dress, but it's totally see through. Fit on my body except my chest area and I got an XL."
2.0,Sizing was extremely off from other jeans.
2.0,"Used the size chart as directed, which directed me to choose a smaller size. With with a large, and it still was too small."
2.0,I was very disappointed with the cheap quality of this hoodie. It is very thin. And seems to run small. The image was actually very nice. Just be aware this is VERY thin material.
2.0,"Pokes you, very uncomfortable"
2.0,"This is a very specific reason I don't like the item. I got these for a friend who has a very unusual plastic/rubber allergy. Anything plastic or rubbery causes a local rash on the facial skin. There is no metal allergy.<br /><br />I thought these would be great as they are all metal.<br /><br />Not so, the nose piece has a plastic pad.<br /><br />Sorry Jimmy Orange, this is not an all metal frame. Not with a plastic pad on the nose. Some people just can't take the plastic."
2.0,"Adorable design that should be super flattering, right? ... Except the workmanship is so, so bad. I ordered this suit in two identical styles and sizes, just different prints. On arrival, one fit like a size larger than the other, despite both having an S label. The dye job on one was imperfect in multiple joined spots. The twist front on the other had been sewn poorly and just hung loose at the bottom instead of being a sweet criss-cross effect. Very inconsistent workmanship here and both were returned."
2.0,I sent this item back because the cheetah print was bright orange and totally clashed with the coral colored stripe!
2.0,The dress has a odor which smells like perfume. Fits too small.
2.0,"Before even trying these on, I found a small hole in the seam near the waistband, as well as the waistband being thinner (in width) than the opposite side. Material is cheap. Very stretchy but cheap and thin. I like a thicker material. I bought them for my softball league. We have red jerseys so I got the black with red because I thought a red heart on my rear would be cute. I tried them on, they feel nice but the elastic on the waistband flips inside of the material. I can't stand that!!! It's annoying and I don't want to be fixing my pants every time I stand up. The only reason I'm not returning them is because I can't...  I ordered them and before even receiving them needed to fly home and got back 4 days after the return window closed.<br />I think they be OK if you needed them for a one time thing or costume or something."
2.0,"Cute, but are an awful material and the pearls fell out right away. I had to put them back on, and when I recieved them in the mail, they came very bend."
2.0,"Inexpensive is one thing; however, cheap is another.  I will probably never wear this set - And I wear a LOT of statement jewelry."
2.0,The material was not what I expected.
2.0,"The straps seem ok. But, in the description said it included one springbar tool and 4 spring bars. Didn't come with any of that. And that was one of the reasons I bougt it for.. So I wouldn't have to buy the spring bars separate."
2.0,My 5 year old can not put these on himself at all. I even had a hard time maneuvering the ear covers myself. Very frustrating. We bought them for my son to wear at my daughter's dance competitions that have music blasting. We didn't even end up using them because they were just too stiff/difficult to use. UGHHHHH.
2.0,So a bit misleading since I think that cap is great but the goggles were sub par. I should have paid more attention to how they were set up. Instead of having the strap be removable with tabs on the sides of the mask for tightening/loosening what they have are these very weak little holes in the side straps coming off of the mask part. This means you can't replace the strap and that all of the tension is on these small holes that the head strap runs through. Needless to say they can't handle it and mine broke today after about 3 months of use. Since it doesn't use the tabs you can't replace strap and the goggles are a waste of money.
2.0,"So bulky, feels terrible"
2.0,"Very thin and see through. I’d have to wear another layer underneath so everyone wouldn’t see my bra, but I don’t want to do that in the hot summer. Returning."
2.0,Doesn't fit correctly. Cheaply made and a little lage in width.
2.0,"The masks are fine, but  one of them were wrong. It wasn't worth having to go out of the way and do a return."
2.0,"EDIT: I wore this dress for the first time and received a lot of compliments as it fit great and was beautiful. Unfortunately, while walking through a restaurant that evening, the back seam tore open. It didn't tear all the way down, but rather ~1/2in from the bottom and up ~3-4in. One of the side seams started to tear and a few threads from the waist started to become loose as well, but weren't nearly as damaging. I contacted the seller and they gave me a small credit for the dress, but did not consider it a factory defect. Personally, I consider poorly sewn material a defect but that is just me. I was so hopeful for this dress, but I no longer trust the quality of clothing this company sells.<br /><br />________________________________________________________________________________________________________________<br />I purchased this dress for my wedding season and plan on wearing it for pre-wedding festivities. I am a 32DD, 28 waist, and 37ish hips and ordered a 6.<br /><br />It is very cute, but I understand how some people may have issues. The bottom and top may not be proportional if you don't have simple measurements. For me, the bottom fits nicely and the top is a little loose, but I like clothes that fit that way, especially in Texas. The top, even when loose, is very flattering. The bottom may be a little bit itchy, but no more so than a dress from Express."
2.0,"They look good, BUT they are not durable for long term use (washing).<br />Also, the top part that covers the nose flips down defeating its purpose."
2.0,I was a little dissapionted with the quality
2.0,Too SMALL+ SMASH+DAMAGE  PLASTIC BRA WAS SMASH & out of SHAPE* IN YOUR PLASTIC BAG mail DELIVERY.. *YOU NEED to do A BOX MAIL ORDER for Your PLASTIC BRA DELIVER.!!! PLUS. The BACK PLASTIC on BRA LOOKS WEAK TO THIN..
2.0,They were too small and the zipper came off first time I wore them
2.0,It fell apart litterally the first day. But its cute as just a plain key chain
2.0,"I'm 5'4 and 110lbs and a small didn't fit me. The top was too big, and the bottoms were awkwardly fitted."
2.0,"I love the print on the photo, but the fabric has not give what so ever and doesn't look as good in person. I wouldn't advise buying if you are bottom heavy."
2.0,I got a note in my package. Someone needed help but they don’t know what to do. I find that very strange
2.0,"flimsy material, tight fit. I would buy a size larger."
2.0,"On advice of other reviews, ordered bigger than my size. I got xl, and I am size 12 right now. I will have to be at least a size 10 to zip these up."
2.0,I dislike when it’s not in plastic sealed bag . It’s not sanitary! But the mask it’s self I really love! I’m debating if I’m going to buy it again.
2.0,Not really as shown on videos unless it needs some hard working brushing time! Used it on my triple white yeezys no much difference they dont look brand new as i saw on videos.
2.0,Fell apart quickly. Had a month and the knit was coming apart. Warm and cozy.
2.0,"Silk is graded based on winding, size, tenacity, elongation, evenness, cleanness, neatness, and cohesion. This scarf falls short in all categories. It is very light weight chiffon with uneven silk threads. I suspect that the threads would pull very easily over time. I returned it immediately."
2.0,Wanted to like this dress. I liked the material. My husband said it made me look huge so it’s going back.
2.0,I’m 5’11” and ordered a small because it matched my measurements but the back and chest was too tight.
2.0,"Very thin, low quality. Not worth the $8.00 I paid for it.  Also, it is so thin the tag that is lightly glued on the fabric pretty much ruins the scarf when pulled off."
2.0,Had to return. Couldn't get my kid's fingers through it.
2.0,"It runs very small, super cute bra just like the pictures, but did not fit. I wear a 36 DD and wanted it to wear under low cut or sheer tops but the large was way too small. Defiantly for petite women."
2.0,"No velcro closure, solid top goes over your foot. Gave the shoes to my daughter-in-law, she has narrower feet."
2.0,Received  two left foot shoes
2.0,"Received the wrong size and colors, didn’t fit snugly on watch. Went back to see if I mistakenly got the wrong size but I didn’t. Was kinda hesitant to order due to some reviews but now I should’ve listened to them 🥲"
2.0,"Okay, so I love the design and quality but I feel like something might be wrong with mine as I can NOT get it installed on both sides!!! One side is super easy and the other I can NOT get in no matter what I do"
2.0,One apron: good quality but only one apron. Description is misleading. The “two pieces” is the one apron and the straps that go with the apron / NOT two aprons!!!!
2.0,I didn't like the pant .it is too long for me.also not suitable for winter.
2.0,this falls apart and looks bad. for a small child party for one time only
2.0,Super cute but falls off easily.
2.0,I kind of hate this. But I hate going through the process of returning it more. The shirt isn’t long enough. On the model you’ll see. It’s long but as you can see in my pic it’s pretty short. I also am not super happy with the color. The photos show a tad darker of a lighth blue. This light blue is nearly white.
2.0,"Not the best quality fabric. And it's thinner than I thought. You can see my son's diaper through the pants. Also, it fit small."
2.0,Product was OK. Crease marks look faded. Not what I expected coming from a 5 star reviewed company ... Oh well
2.0,"Size questionable, doesn't fit in a traditional wallet. Too much trouble to return."
2.0,It is a beautiful piece. But the first night I went to sleep it broke. And I can not fix if.
2.0,"Bad quality, it irritated my neck and rusted after a week."
2.0,"I just got the bag yesterday and I was disappointed. The bag in the pictures seem a lot bigger than what I received. I liked the color but I wanted it for its size unfortunately, it did not meet my expectations. I'm still keeping the bag just repurpose it as a lunch bag."
2.0,Bag looks great but smell is horrible.  On my second round of trying to deodorize it so I can hopefully use it!
2.0,"I ordered this for chemo but it is too small for a blanket and necessities. After chemo it will be a great size for appointments. Wallet, treats, yarn, blanket, AirPods, meds, chapstick. Odds and ends necessary. It also attracts dirt, lint and dog hair. Very cute 🥰"
2.0,These are so sooooo cute but they are only meant to go over a normal mask! Not to be worn alone.
2.0,Uhhhhh yeah super cute. Too bad I have to try and alter them myself. One side didn’t have ANY buttons. I guess I’m going to go to Walmart and try to figure out how to put on these metal buttons. Cause if I don’t my daughter will be showing her underwear. Like seriously how hard is it to make sure all your pants have buttons on them before shipping?!?!
2.0,I don't care about the weight want matters is how long the charge lasts. They all seem to under preform if you buy a heated vest understand this and be prepared to buy extra battery packs if you plan to be using it for an extended time like cold weather camping this one is no better than others and cheaper ones can be found if you're going to be changing them out alot anyway
2.0,Even with the 5% spandex could not get these on.  The other issue is that there are strings on the inside of the sockets so your toes got caught.  Like the design but have to have smal legs for these to fit.
2.0,"The product fit my daughter perfectly. She is getting ready to go the 9th grade, and she is athletic. She likes to wear jogging pants around the house to relax. These look great and have retained their color after several washings BUT...... they are already splitting at the seams.  Two of the 4 I have bought are splitting at the seam around the calf area and the inside thigh.  Both I can sew up, but we have only had these for a couple of months, so it makes me suspect the quality of the product."
2.0,"These pants are really comfortable and warm, but it's SO annoying that the legs are not the same length! The first one I bought, the right pant leg was about 1 inch longer than the left and I find myself pulling the right leg up several times throughout the day. The fleece-lining was so comfortable that I thought maybe I got a defective product and bought a second one... this one, the left leg was longer than the right! 😩😩😩 Super comfy until you get up and move around. As much as I want to, I can't give this product more stars because the leg lengths just annoy me to no end."
2.0,"Thought I would take a chance on this based on reviews. I am usually a perfect size 8, but I ordered an XL based on other reviews. It did fit, but the quality is awful. The zipper is on the wrong side and is very difficult to zip. The plaid does not match and the hem is not even. It is lined but the fabric is bulky and doesn't lie well. The picture is not a good representation.<br />I'm sending it back because it is not something I could wear."
2.0,I like them but only one shoe lights up
2.0,Most didn't work as advertised...a few died after only being on an hour
2.0,"This skirt was way too small but being a seamstress nad because I like it so much I am actually adjusting thr size it fit,"
2.0,Does not have any shine very well and I did not know it was so little.  I will try to use them
2.0,The shirt came with a bleached spot that I didn't notice until later. Fits well though.
2.0,Fits weird had to bend it a lot
2.0,Chapter ring is saligned with watch face indices and bezel indices
2.0,"The grey of the vest area and the arm area are different, and the edge stitches are clearly visible on the front of the sweater. Returned."
2.0,"The website states that the skirt is sized to &#34;fit most&#34;.<br />When it arrived, however, the tag read M, which I assume indicated that the skirt was, indeed, a specific medium size.<br />I would have preferred a size Large, to be sure, and am disappointed in the fit and in the advertising on the website."
2.0,The material is very thin. Not good quality material. Very cheaply made.
2.0,Arms are very tight . The fabric is scratchy  . It doesn't feel good against my skin .
2.0,"So it started out too large. I know you can never expect it to look quite like the model (since they are all the size of a toothpick) but this was so long it was 5"" below my knee. I am 5'6"", average height, but this was almost Amish looking. I generally wear Medium (36D) bra size, and I ordered Medium. but it was so big. Returning this, def. not a cute look."
2.0,Even though I ordered an extra large (which was sent) it did't fit like an extra large. Also I expected a plain blue shirt without a pattern which I accept was my fault for not reading the description more closely.. This shirt has chrome buttons which were too flashy for someone my age.
2.0,it does nothing
2.0,Was really hoping this would be cute . Nope just makes ya looking wide & frumpy . I got a med it’s a little big but gonna pass all together .
2.0,"I love the earrings & necklace!<br />Sadly, the Evil Eye necklace pendant arrived chipped as seen in the pictures attached.<br />I will be returning the jewelry set because of the pendant is chipped (not what I paid for, broken jewelry)."
2.0,"I ordered XL- the tag says XL-but it fits,& looks small. the item isn't true to form. I am a size 14-16 and this dress is nothing in size to this.<br />Luvada Smith<br />luvadaj@sbcglobal.net"
2.0,it's okay not quite what they picture it to Be
2.0,Disappointed because they are very cute. But the genius who designed them affixed the post to the top of the back instead of in the middle (to distribute weight properly and balance). So they don’t hang right because of the size and weight. Not sure how they will hold up while in use.
2.0,Paint chipped like day 2
2.0,"got all black bracelets, when ordered the red/black set. only revieved one card and two tiny gift bags that could barely fit a quater in it. very upset bc these were all gifts. only reason im not sending back is bc its too close to xmas."
2.0,"The bands were a nice quality, however they latched in the center back of your wrist.  This creates a bit of a challenge as they latch with magnets, which allows for the ""picking up"" of any small items by  said magnets (paper clips, pins, dinnerware). We have returned them therefore, for something else."
2.0,"Lasted me 3 months and broke, I barely used them."
2.0,I don't know what the other reviewers talking about. The quality was ok at best but for the price can't complain. However the front pockets are very small you won't be able to fit a phone in there. And the way it sits was not comfortable
2.0,"You get what you pay for. Poorly made. One of the tops in the package was sewn completely crooked, the side seam almost touched my belly button. Another I actually ended up turning around backwards at some point during the day because the neckline was so high up otherwise that it was uncomfortable. None of the straps stay in place"
2.0,"While the jacket fit slightly too snug and I ordered my usual size, more annoying was the wet dog smell it emits when it gets wet. Strange"
2.0,I have another pair of these pants that are supposed to be the same and they are buttery soft and so comfortable. These are not the same material and not nearly as comfortable. The fabric feels totally different than the first pair I have even though it is supposed to be the same. I would not order these again.
2.0,The leather for the chain is a closed piece and fits over no one's head!  Be prepared to replace it. We cut it off and put on a regular chain. I'm not sure who this tiny thing would fit. I bought for a ten year old and here was no way he could get it on. He loves the charm though.
2.0,"The fit is good however, nothing special about this top. For the cost I expected it to be more like my Smartwool tops but it is really just a glorified base layer."
2.0,"I was disappointed, it looked good. But didn't fit well. And for material was cheap and could tell it was going to be a hot shirt to wear. It's not all bad, go up one size and you might actually like it. I'm picky about material feel on my skin. With an undershirt this could be a very good looking shirt. I was bummed. I wanted to like it. Color was true to picture. And it's a good looking shirt."
2.0,This runs incredibly small. Had to size up 2-3 sizes for it to fit. The neckline is too low and loose. Would not recommend.
2.0,Catches every bit of makeup you wear and is impossible to clean out of it
2.0,"The design is great but unfortunately, its to small and there are gaps on both sides of the mask even after adjusting the ear straps.  I'm an average size woman and the mask barely covers my chin.  Material wise, it's great... it just needs to made tighter on the sides so that nothing can get in and a it needs to be a tad bit longer to go under the chin...not just on it.  One good thing is the nose area is GREAT!"
2.0,The fit was small so order a size larger than you normally would!
2.0,Nice boots to look at but not to wear.  After three times wearing they are ready for the garbage.
2.0,Cushion flattened quickly on sole- then felt like walking on cardboard. Very disappointed
2.0,"While this is a cute watchband, I think it is plastic and not leather.  It just does not have the suppleness of leather."
2.0,I am a size H bra and this shirt is a little too tight in the chest(barely) but my waist isnt that big so the bottom flowy part made me look bigger than I am. I would suggest to the maker to add a little more shape to it. And the material was a little scratchy and not breathable. I sadly have to return it.
2.0,"After wearing for a few hours, it becomes clear that the cups are too large because they start gapping. Also, the band is too large and doesn’t stay in place... it rides up. Not ideal for small sizes."
2.0,Looks cute in photos but in person the material was very cheap. Kind of reminded me of Halloween costume material if that makes sense.
2.0,"I purchased these earrings based on many positive reviews. My package arrived quickly, which was wonderful. But when I opened the package I was disappointed to see that my earrings are not the shiny, almost brilliant blue color pictured but a dull, dark blue. I even shined a light on them to see if I could replicate the picture. Didn't work. The size is good, especially if you have double-pierced earrings. I wanted to purchase more colors from this manufacturer but I will not do that now as I have no confidence the earrings will match their picture."
2.0,I like the product but the screws have fallen out and shades can't be re-attached. I can't find any way to contact the company to ask for replacement screws.
2.0,Not easy on. Cut me off at the knee. Says wash before wearing. How would you send back then?  Also now that I wore for a few hours and it was too tight at top and cut me off I can’t return either. Waste of money. Swelling in lower legs.
2.0,As far as I can tell the beeping when pressing a button cannot be turned off. This makes the watch useless for me. The answers and reviews indicated that this beep could be turned off. If anyone knows other wise please let me know.<br /><br />Screen is also quite small.
2.0,Takes batteries can't figure out where they go???
2.0,It was very scratchy and had a strong smell that was unpleasant. Returned.
2.0,Way too small for being a large. No ball room
2.0,Lens is decent quality but often falls out of the frame
2.0,The watch actually hurt my wrist when I wore it.  Ended up giving it to a co-worker.
2.0,"Not as expected quality, The skirt part of the dress felt so coarse and the top material was flimsy. Had to return."
2.0,"I'm a 36C, and I know everyone is built different, but the Med is way too small for my chest, and body.  Re-ordering an X-Large."
2.0,"It's not worth the price.  Image is cute, but way larger than expected.  The plastic is hard, cheap, and has sharp edges.  After peeling off the protective cover, they key chain is sticky and smells like strong glue."
2.0,"Appeared like multiple bracelets in the order, it was just 1"
2.0,"Man, I ordered this outfit in a 2X!! and when I saw that 2x was more like a small. I don't know what happened because I was looking forward to wearing it to an event, but this was nowhere near a size 2x I looked at the reviews and I was thinking I would be good but no. I guess this is a try for yourself and see because it worked for some people and others it doesn't.  This isn't for the plus size or thick girls."
2.0,It is so hard to see with them. I feel like I am in a 3D theater watching a movie without the 3D glasses.
2.0,"I was expecting more from these earrings.  Literally, I expected them to be larger.  Makes sense though, given the price.  It may be that I don't grasp the metric scale very well.  It's an ok to below average buy for the price."
2.0,The hem was uneven--longer in the front and back than it was on the sides. Fabric is rough.
2.0,"Cute fit, but Not holding up after a few washes. There are small elastic threads sticking out in an embarrassing spot!"
2.0,If i was skinnier i probably would have loved this shirt. With that being said it was very form fitting through stomach area which i did not like. Color was as pictured and seemed to be good fabric!!! Wish it would have fit more like my Agnes and Dora dolmans!!!!
2.0,Ordered correctly but it's sized smaller.
2.0,"Didn't like fabric it's see through, now what I expected"
2.0,Not stretchy. Feels cheap.
2.0,they are too tight and too thin can see underwear through them and tight
2.0,"I use these sunglasses as a second pair to use while golfing.  There is a flaw in the design of the right arm of these sunglasses.  There is a blue plastic &#34;e|o&#34; logo that is glued into the right arm.  This makes that one area of the arm weaker and more brittle than the rest of the arm.  As a result, I went to take them off the other day and the arm snapped at that spot.<br /><br />The lens itself is pretty good.  I guess you get what you paid for.  Replacement parts search online came up empty for me.  Search of the company itself also came up empty online."
2.0,The quality of this shirt is very bad. The fabric isn’t stretchy at all and the shirt is too small.
2.0,"Took forever to arrive (from China!) Pretty enough, but for the price I would have expected a touch-button for easy open, and a rod that's not so flimsy and cheap. As it is, this umbrella is a struggle to open AND close. Not great when you're trying to get seamlessly into and out of cars and buildings without getting rained on. Would not recommend."
2.0,"In the photo of this piece of jewelry the stone is very beautiful, bright pink and luminescent.  When I got mine, it is nothing like what was in the photo.  My stone was very dark, so dark that you would almost say it was brown.  It lacks almost all luster and transparency that you would expect of a piece of rose quartz.  In fact, I have my doubts that the pendent I received is even actually a real piece of rose quartz at all.  I don't know maybe every piece is different but mine was sure a disappointment.  If the pendants do all resemble mine, it is nothing like what you see in the photo and I would look else where for beautiful specimens of rose quartz jewelry."
2.0,"The seller sent a cherry red gummy bear on a stick, instead of a pink bubblegum.  Other than that, she really loves these things."
2.0,Beautiful product. I find that all of these waist trainers that are made of neoprene run very small and are a bit of a battle to put on. In the classic lace and netting I take a small in several manufactures. I use these for back support not waist training. For my uses I will stick to the classic lace and stretch netting.
2.0,It’s nice but Very Tight. Unflattering in the back.  Great in the front.  Can’t wear it :(
2.0,"Very nice dress but was way too small, XL was barely a medium, and have to send back all the way to China for a refund.:("
2.0,"Giving 2 stars because it’s not returnable. I ordered a small, but it’s way too big so I can’t even wear it. I’m disappointed because I hoped to be able to return it and order an extra small. Oh well."
2.0,Cute but a bit heavy and one rhinestone has already fallen off. Would not recommend.
2.0,Thin material and the color was different than I anticipated. This and the price caused a return of the product.
2.0,not very de pendable
2.0,Bumper case is so cheap! It broke in a week.
2.0,These are like 60s style bell bottoms.  Too big for boot cut.
2.0,"Overall a really nice necklace accept the misspelling on it and the word ""think"" and the ""&"" symbol are too close together. The surface of this cross features an American flag on the front and an inspirational quote on the back: ""Always remember you are Brover (should be BRAVER) than you believe Stronger than you seem Smarter than you think& (there should be a space between think and &) Loved more than you know""  It is made with high-grade stainless steel. I was going to give it to my son, but since it has the misspelled word on it, I only gave him the two chains it comes with. I just wish I would have ordered another one with a different quote on it. Buyer beware. I should have looked closer at the pictures before picking this verse."
2.0,bad stitching
2.0,"Not what I expected, easy return however.  Fabric was kinda like cheap drapes."
2.0,Do not buy if your any kind of chubby. The waist band is at full extension here x.x Have not used it yet other than to try it on.
2.0,Buckle broke immediately.
2.0,One of the eyelets come off the first wash. Other than that my husband was happy with them
2.0,"This item's chain broke w/in days of putting it on my daughter.  Too bad, she really loved it.  The dolphin was beautiful, it's just too bad the chain is so poorly made."
2.0,Cute dress but it's too tight in the chest.
2.0,Personal credit and bank cards are too easily accessible even with the wallet snapped shut. I do not feel like this product holds my sensitive financial items securely. I am shopping for a new wallet.
2.0,This a very shiny and chic dress but the sequence falls off.
2.0,Made for a short guy. Rolls up to much
2.0,"Cambia de color en 48 hrs de uso, se obscurece<br />Es buena para varias ocasiones si lo usas poco tiempo<br />El diseño es hermoso"
2.0,too small to fit around my calves. and I dont have large calves.... and it was made from crappy material
2.0,"All of the color was gone within about a week. When the first arrive, the colors were vibrant, but the rose and gold tones wore away quickly. The rings don't stack together perfectly either. They have slightly differing curves at the chevron point. I'd recommend passing on this one."
2.0,"Cheap quality, and bad fitting."
2.0,Looked forward to receiving this jacket but had to start the return process immediately. Smelled gross right out of the bag and was too big to be a US XS (sleeves fit ok but the body was huge).
2.0,"Hardly stay on, too bad, another disappointment"
2.0,All of the buttons down the back of the dress are barely stitched on and came off when we unbuttoned them to try the dress on
2.0,"Am I missing something? I got the 0.0 magnification as I want these for glare only. I notice nothing. Literally can lift up the glasses from my eyes and put them back on while staring at the computer screen in a somewhat lit area and notice no difference. The frames seem fairly well made and I like that there are 2 pairs but at this point, all this is doing is making me look smarter. I should probably just return these. The lenses don’t even look yellow tinted like the person’s who recommended them to me. :-/"
2.0,very nice material but cups are smalleer than 38 C which is my size.. I could not return it but contacted seller NO ANSWER.
2.0,This is a cheep necklace for the value. The chain broke shortly after taking it out of the box.
2.0,Not sewn properly.  Very uneven sides.
2.0,The Material feels more like rubber than a bathing suit.
2.0,"It's okay, not great and definitely not worth what I paid. There are pieces of raffia already loose and dangling right out of the package. I should have returned it."
2.0,"It feels very soft and comfortable. But the button is very easy to come off. Also, very easy to get wrinkle."
2.0,Sized two sizes too small.  Very annoying.
2.0,I loved the color just not the fit.
2.0,This thing is so small it is ridiculous.  I bought the 4 X because I read the reviews!  I wear a size 14-16 and the 4X is suppose to fit a size 18.  It looks to be about a size 12.  It is also short so if you have a long torso you will not be able to pull it all the way up.  I did squeeze into it but it won't stay up over my breast on the off the shoulder side.  It is so cute and the fabric is nice; too bad it runs so small.
2.0,"Looks beautiful and came quickly, however, I wore it one time, and noticed it was missing two jump rings, it completely broke in half midway through the day. :("
2.0,"I ordered my normal size, however, they were too small. Fabric was very thin, regret not sending them back.  The pattern was pretty."
2.0,Tears easily
2.0,I ordered a necklace and received a bracelet. That's my main complaint.
2.0,It’s made of cotton so it’s comfortable on the face but very thin layers (2 only). Need filter to be effective. The inside layer opens to one side so not easy to insert filter correctly.
2.0,"Very thin, and very short. Basically, a narrow tube of chiffon, with frayed seam. It will fit your neck INSIDE of your collar, like an ascot, if you choose to keep it. Color/style not as shown."
2.0,Did not match photo...very cheaply made. Blue color
2.0,Don't think the &#34;padding&#34; will help. It definitely is not designed to give you any boost.
2.0,"Cheap looking.  One post screws in further that the other one and the post are fragile looking like they will bend very easily, not for an active child.<br />Disappointed would not have purchase if seen in person."
2.0,"I liked the look and feel of them, but they are not true to size.  I didn't return them because the thought of doing that felt icky."
2.0,I got these because they said long. They are not long at all. Made for a petite person. And they are very wide on the bottom so they do not fit like the picture. Ended up giving them to my 12yr old daughter.
2.0,The length of these pants were about 8-9 inches too long for me.  I am 5’4.
2.0,"I am returning this. It fits nicely, except for the top-- it gapes out significantly around the armpit/shoulder area and looks a bit silly. I haven't had this problem with clothes before, so I dont think it's just my body type. It was hard to capture in a picture, but I tried."
2.0,The leather is cheap. I don't know if you can expect better. But I need a good quality leather
2.0,The shoe material did not match the photo. The photo material looks like faux fur but in person looks like teddy bear material. Returned them.
2.0,"These wrinkle up easily and they don't wash up very nicely. :(<br /> For all intensive purposes, they work-- but I wouldn't order again."
2.0,Had to return. Very well made. But if your a true D way way too small. And theres no size to move up to. Its a return
2.0,"It's exactly like the picture. It fits funny, it's uncomfortable and it has a really short torso, my daughter is petite and it's to small on her in the torso but is huge in the shoulder part"
2.0,Runs super small. Not at all flowy like the picture. Very cheap material and they used as little fabric as possible. Sleeves too short. Won't wrap around to close.  Very cheap and disappointing.
2.0,"Cute, right length, but definitely not true to size. I could not get it on. I may have needed 2 sizes up."
2.0,"These are a cute design, but one earring arrived with a rusty, tarnished post. No way I’m putting it in my ear. The same one is also bent out of shape and no way to bend it back. So not very happy with these, will probably return."
2.0,Looks better in the picture. Great stretchy material though.
2.0,"Pro-These fit nicely and the waistband was awesome..no rolling or pinching.<br /><br />Con-You get what you pay for. The pad wvs dead after a single 1hr ride. Since we typically ride30-40 miles, this is unacceptable.<br /><br />I am on a weight loss journey and didn't want to buy $150 shorts that I would only wear for a couple months but these shorts were NO savings at all. Worn once and off to Goodwill.  save your money and buy quality cycling shorts."
2.0,They are very thin and not qualitative
2.0,Time runs slow. Dissapointed.
2.0,"This is a nice coverup, but the side slits were not flattering on my hips."
2.0,"Well it is kind of cute, but not made very well. There were strings hanging off it and fuzzy stuff from other colors here and there over the sweater. In the picture it looks like it goes fuller at the bottom, no it doesn't. In fact it looks narrower. Where the bottoms on the side are located, it makes that area kind of pucker up making it look even more narrow at the bottom than from the top.<br />I would not purchase it again, but I will keep it. It will be a little cover up when it gets chilly."
2.0,Pretty... Turns my finger green. Somewhat falling apart already.
2.0,Came in and the purse was HUGE and looks kind of cheap. It's okay.
2.0,Very baggy. Sleeves looked as if long sleeves were sewn onto the ends of the short sleeves.
2.0,They are cute but my ears turned black from the stems.
2.0,It runs on the smaller side for fit and the hem was a mess there were threads bunched all over the hem very cheaply made.
2.0,Cute graphics. Thin material and runs small
2.0,Looks really.
2.0,"The bathing suit is cute but the sizing is awful. I weigh around 150, I'm 5'4ish and my weight distribution is average for my size. I wear a 34-36c bra and ~ size 6-8 pants. I got this in a XL (US 8-10).<br /><br />The top is WAAAAAY to big. Like, I thought I was relatively large in the chest area, but this is insane. I'd classify this as something like a 38DD. It makes me feel like a 12 year old boy. I can't imagine anyone of average size who wears a US 8-10 fitting into this. There is no way I could wear this in public. Even tied as tight as it goes, it hangs somewhere in my mid-region and rests about 3 inches away from my skin.<br /><br />The worst part is, the bottom is a bit too small. You'd expect it to be as large as the top, right? Nope. It's made for someone who's disadvantaged in the behind, I suppose. The leg holes are uncomfortably tight around my thighs and my waist is bordering on a muffin top when I put this on. The polka dots on my butt become little pink ovals and the blue becomes slightly see-through.<br /><br />Maybe I'd have better things to say if the top and bottom were actually a coordinating size - I'd just decide that I bought too large, or too small. But this swimsuit is definitely designed for Barbie or someone similarly top-heavy. I'm very confused and somewhat afraid. However, it's adorable, and the material seems nice, so I'll give it that."
2.0,"I liked the idea of a belt with no chains, but this thing is just way too bulky. Takes too much space in a girl's bag. I decided to go for the chained Harbinger instead."
2.0,"The touchscreen seldom works on my iphone7. If you want warm well-fitted gloves, you can buy these or there are better options available. But if you want the touchscreen capability, it isn't worth the money."
2.0,This shirt waz not what I expected.  It runs small and is more fitted that what is shown in the photo.
2.0,"You get what you pay for, these feel like paper, not soft at all!"
2.0,"This shirt is not true to size. I bought them for my daughter. She takes a medium, I bought her a large snd it just fit. The fabric is very stiff snd feels scratchy on the skin. Update: both shirts were the same size and one was smaller than the other"
2.0,5’7 140lbs pants do not come up high enough. Material was thinner than expected. Cute but not for me.
2.0,Love the colors but not flattering on
2.0,It’s way smaller than the picture it wouldn’t cover anything not a good buy
2.0,Vey large. Ordered a small and I'm usually a medium. It still looked like I was wearing a tent.
2.0,"in other compression socks I am a size small.  Ordered small from here, and they are so tight. They hurt my toes in the front while I'm working b/c they're so tight.  I do like the fabric though, I can tell they are good quality."
2.0,"Shirt is actually really nice for the price, runs a size small though so I won’t be able to wear mine"
2.0,"Like: Funny design - not really 3D but ok<br />Disliked: Thin material with a horrid chemical smell even after 2 washings. More of a novelty than a real mask, but for $9.99 I did expect something that was usable. Not as “tall” as most masks I have."
2.0,It runs large!
2.0,The sleeves were really tight
2.0,Loved the idea of this shirt but way off basis in size. Had to give to a friend who has kids that can fit into
2.0,you can blow out a candle while wearing it. (which means its not proper PPE) only 2 thick layers
2.0,"Despite using the sizing chart as well as other's reviews, the dress fit is off...the waist hits very high on me.  I asked my daughter if she wanted it and she said ""sure, for a nightgown...""  going back!"
2.0,"The sizing is just plain ridiculous.  I am 5'5&#34; and wear a large in almost everything I buy, but I ordered a medium anyway and not only was it still WAY too big, it literally went down to my knees in the front.  Not a good look."
2.0,This is my favorite album ever. It’s fits well. I got it for Christmas 2022. I’ve worn it a handful of times and the red is already pretty much washed out. I’m so bummed!
2.0,Very pretty but the stone wasn’t glued in when it arrived
2.0,"Don’t get me wrong. This is a very nice product. What inspired me to make the purchase was the design of the camera mounted plate that allowed one to add a tripod quick release plate. What they didn’t make clear was that this function only works with their tripod plates. My manfroto quick release attached just fine but became impossible to remove without using channel locks. Their support response was:<br />“Due to product patent issues, our products are not compatible with all the quick release plates, so it may lead to your situation。<br />So we recommend using our brand's stand as much as possible, I hope you can understand.<br />Best regards<br />TYCKA team<br />KIm”<br /><br />If you want this item, You should also purchase one of their sub-par “stands”"
2.0,"Ordered a 38 which was labeled as an adult medium. Fit more like a youth jersey. Short, tight. Sent back for a larger size and will<br />Update"
2.0,"Too small. They are adjustable, but are still too tight around the waist for an average 10 year old boy."
2.0,"Tapers didn't have a label saying what the size was. Spent more time trying to figure out the order of them, then actually gauging myself. Metal was okay quality, didn't irritate me. I still had to buy plugs, so I would recommend buying a plug/taper kit instead of this. I was also missing two pieces and never heard back from customer service about them. Wish I could return these."
2.0,The rubber broke after a week of occasional wear.  That's one of the earliest failures in products that I've experienced in ages.
2.0,"Gave as a gift. Cute socks, but only two out of the five were the pattern shown. The other three were different, and I didn't like them nearly as well as what's shown. We received the dragon and the octopus shown, but not the yeti, ocean scene, or fish. Instead we received a sea monster and two we can't identify at all. So be aware that &#34;Same as the picture shows&#34; is not accurate!"
2.0,"For some reason the armpit hole comes up into your pits more than the pictures lead you to believe. Normal tanks arm holes go lower in the arm region.  Material is decent.  Shipping was fast.  Packaging was good.  I think once they fix the arm pit issue, these would be decent budget tanks."
2.0,"I have been asked to give my honest and unbiased opinion about this product. I got this for the headlamp, not even realizing it had the headphones built in. I like the concept, but not this product. The headlamp isn't very bright and the charge doesn't last very long. I also can't get the Bluetooth to connect to be able to use the headphones part. The charging ports aren't very accessible and its a pain to try and charge."
2.0,"After two washes and two wears the elasticity on the top half of the dress was ruined. It was a beautiful dress to wear but I wish the quality of the elastic was better. If you just want this dress for one wear, absolutely get it but I am not happy that i already have to throw it away. To me, wasn't worth it."
2.0,tooooooooo small
2.0,Butt busted out along the seam while doing a Patrol Rifle course (about an hr into it). This pant would probably be good if you’re not planning on sitting / doing ground work while shooting. I wear a 34 and even ordered the 36...still didn’t matter; I believe if I would have gone bigger the pant would not have fit properly.
2.0,Cute print..but wrong fabric for a facemask.
2.0,"Positive:  attractive watch, like the large size; like the color<br />Negative: frustrating adjustmens with the buttons; dial is hard to read<br /><br />Ultimately, the negatives won out; would not recommend"
2.0,She wears a 12 and I ordered up because of the reviews but this thing is cutting my babies circulation off.
2.0,This is not a floppy hat.  It is a regular sized hat.
2.0,Had to send them back.  They slipped off my heel and the arch was in the wrong place to fit well.
2.0,The dress is very see-through so I had to wear a slip underneath. I’m a size medium and I had to get a extra large and that was still too small. The length is very short. I’m 5” 4” and it barely passed my mid thigh’s.
2.0,This material is too thin
2.0,Too heavy. Weird fit.
2.0,"This dress doesn't fit the way it should. I am short with hops, and the pocket sticks out when I put it on. I bought this dress back un 2020, and haven't worn it yet because of the da* pockets 🙄"
2.0,I bought this sound it Bluetooth but was not pleased. The sound is great however the seem on top if very unflattering just looks awful.
2.0,I'm a little thicker ( I have boobs and a butt) and this was SOOO short. I had to return it because you could see my private
2.0,"First off, the zipper is on the opposite side of any typical men's zip up, which is weird but manageable. However, the stitching is loose and uneven, and the thread basically falls out. Also the color is of from the picture advertised; it's less of a light khaki and more like a dirty linen color. Besides the ugly look of it, it is somewhat comfortable and serves it's one purpose of keeping you warm."
2.0,"I sent them back.  They just look cheap.  For workout, they are fine.  Streetwear, no."
2.0,Took weeks to get -- finally here 1 1/2 inch split in seam over right breast.  Not worth the time and hassle to re do.  Fit would have been fine.  My loss.
2.0,It fits perfect everywhere else but left absolutely no room for my boobs. It was completely unwearable.
2.0,"The quality for this skirt just wasn’t good. You get what you pay for, which is fair, but because the material was so cheap, it required constant adjusting to keep its shape, not ride up, and for the belt to stay centered. I ended up buying a different skirt that cost more because I’d rather pay a bit more if it means I’ll get more wear out of it."
2.0,"Its very cheap and does not look like the photo, it is not worth $68.00 more like $25.00 not a good buy"
2.0,I like the dress but was not impressed because there was a snag in it upon arrival.
2.0,"I ordered the xl size as the instructions were to order bigger size. When I got the vest, it seemed very small. No way could I wear it"
2.0,I ordered these pants based on the statement that they fit 'true to size'. They DO NOT. Order at least a size bigger. And definitely take into consideration if you're wearing an IWB weapon.
2.0,"This coat fit great in the body, but I could not get my arms in the sleeves.  It's as if they attached the wrong size sleeve to the coat.  Had to return it."
2.0,"Cheapest, smallest necklace ever sold.  They must have used the biggest zoom lens on the camera to make it appear decent.  The chain was in a separate bag, tangled hopelessly as I was putting the pendant on it and ended up breaking.  Not worth the money paid for it.  UGH."
2.0,The fabric feels like 1980s polyester
2.0,"Están más chicas de cómo se ven en la foto, con trabajo y me tapa la nariz."
2.0,I ordered my regular size but should have sizes up one or two sizes.
2.0,Christmas gift . Not as expected.
2.0,Poor fit since light-weight synthetic material lacks elasticity.<br />The legs consistently ride up my thigh.  Not a good design.
2.0,"These pants run a size too large. Otherwise, they were nice pants.  Had to return them."
2.0,"These socks are advertised as being a cotton blend (37% cotton).  On the packages I received. there's.NO COTTON...just microfiber, and elastane.  Purchased these instead of others, because of the cotton component. I have been duped."
2.0,stitching came out where the keyhole is after only a couple wears and washes.
2.0,My son said it was a little uncomfortable and I could tell it was because he felt restrained on his breathing. I think that the product is too tight around the face. He is 7 years old in case you need a reference point. My daughter did not like it at all.
2.0,"The strap is attached to only one side, so all of the weight in the bag puts extreme strain on the straps and forces the bag to be totally lop-sided and the straps are going to rip out at any moment."
2.0,"Not at all worth the price. Runs two sizes small, extremely thin fabric that tears easily. Stitching started coming out while wearing them for the first time. Does not include suspenders pictured. Do not recommend."
2.0,"First time trying something like this, definitely did  not hold as I expected and they were way too small,<br />I ordered the xxxl and barely covers my boob. Or holds them up, but it did it well enough to make it through the day.<br />I have to restock them a few times during the day as well."
2.0,the pencil case pictured has the fluffy monkey which I love. the one I received has the rubber monkey. I'm dissapointed because I specifically ordered this one because it shows the fluffy monkey.
2.0,"Love the looks of jeans.  Bought as a gift for teenaged granddaughter.  I did not order ""short"" length, but that's what they were.  Do not have time to send back to seller before Christmas."
2.0,"Cheap POS. Insignia is just a decal placed over a what looks like a store bought coffee mug.  Haven’t washed it yet, but expect decal to wash off."
2.0,"I'm 5' 115 lbs. These pants (even if you order the smallest size, are MONSTROUSLY HUGE. My fiancé found it so funny he decided to try them on top of his sweatpants. He is a little over 6' tall and 190lbs. The ""small"" size was still big on him, even with the sweatpants on underneath."
2.0,Small plastic one shattered almost immediately. Long metal one my 6'2 husband finds too long to use easily
2.0,Fell apart with in a week:/
2.0,Looked different than pictures - not flattering on me.
2.0,I ordered two of these based on &#34;Amazon Favorite&#34; and they are extremely low quality. I would expect to pay 1/3 of the list price based on the low grade fabric and poor assembly of the garment.
2.0,"I purchased one over the summer. I loved it so much I decided to get another one last month. It has just arrived and to my disappointment, it turns out that the color, fabric and style is not consistent. The one I got in June had a gathered neckline and tighter batwing like sleeves. The new one has a t-shirt style neckline and sleeves. The fabric looks and feels different. Also the new version is wider at the bottom so converting the new dress into a tunic is not an option as it won’t stay on the hips like the old version. It just slips back down. I’m bummed."
2.0,Cute glasses but smaller than they advertise.  Then I learned they couldn’t be returned.  Not thrilled with that
2.0,The fit is not great. Constantly slipping off my nose. There's little threads inside that itch my face as well. I've bought some face shields from SA and they fit great. Those are a great deal. These ones I feel like I wasted my money. I bought them and I don't even use them.
2.0,It turned orange and made my skin itchy! 😩
2.0,"Ordered a medium and the bottoms fit good but the top didn't fit.  Since I loved the look of it so much I decided to buy a large set (same color set) so I could wear a large top and medium bottoms.  Although it fit perfectly, they were different shades of blue.  Very disappointed."
2.0,it arrived on time but i did not really like it. well it is a cheap watch...you get what you pay for
2.0,I didn’t like the fit or material. I was looking for a summer dress and this didn’t work for me.
2.0,"Had really high hopes for this dress — the model makes it look so flowy, fitting, and cute! First, this dress runs extremely large ... I wear a L/XL (14/16) in dresses usually and I was SWIMMING in this XL. Second, the fabric is horrendous ... cheap, not soft, and definitely no breathe to it. Ended up returning."
2.0,It is very cheap looking.
2.0,Cheap fabric and kind of confusing which way is up/down as neither sit/stay on shoulders comfortably. I wish there was size options for this item.
2.0,Did not fit my Maui Jim sunglasses
2.0,"It’s a nice bag and all, but the color is very different, it’s an ugly color and doesn’t have the denim look it shows in the pictures"
2.0,No quedo como esperaba
2.0,"The print is cute, fabric is soft but the tassels are a mangled mess. They’re horribly sewn. Returning for sure."
2.0,This dress was a cute design and fit me well. The issues I had were that the black faded a bit and on the flowers you could see black dots/smeared print.
2.0,"I wear a woman's 8-10 so I thought getting the 8-10 would be exactly what I needed. Boy was I wrong. The top is embarrassingly small so i'm not posting a picture of it. The bottoms weren't as bad, but the material used doesn't seem like actual bathing suit material, more like legging material, so I can't attest to it being used in the pool or at the beach since like I said earlier it's kind of embarrassing all together. The ONLY redeeming quality is the Union Jack cover up. It's a very soft material and is pretty large. I got this with the intent to use the top and cover up with a cosplay so I can at least still use the cover up, but I'll probably end up donating the suit to one of my smaller chested friends."
2.0,Very stylish looking but made my wrist begin to itch after about an hour of wear.
2.0,Little large around the waist
2.0,"These neckwarmers have synthetic fur on the inside, and woven exterior (felt like wool, rough cotton, or a synthetic wool).  They were very large and loose, not great for skiing for anything where wind is blowing.  It wouldn't stay up when pulled up over the ears.  Overall these were not great, I wouldn't recommend them."
2.0,"These shirts are short!  Buy a size larger, unless you want to tuck your shirt in all day."
2.0,"Hard to keep on, not much structure. Really not much more than an L-shaped bag of down. Finally stuck a pair of insoles in them to keep the bottom from rolling around and up the side.  Going to stick with tried and true wool sox."
2.0,Flimsy fabric.  Looks cheap.
2.0,I am 5 ft 1 in and this dress way way too long. It is going back.
2.0,they need to change the sizing on the list
2.0,"There was a learning curve with these.  First--You can't cross your legs with them on. OUCH!  Second--they were a tad bit tight. So I had to brush up on my sewing skills.  I cut the elastic (which I knew violated the warranty, or what there was of one) and sewed  a 3 inch piece of elastic (salvaged from a cheap pair of leggings,  which is another review in itself) to extend the back of the garter.  Third--fabric glue does not hold.  The original elastic had glue where the elastic attaches to the decorative part of the garter (the heart, studs and clips), looped through a ring and sealed with fabric glue.  This gave out yesterday.  But I'm glad I sharpened my sewing skills, because it came in handy for this repair.  Fourth--you really do need a back clip otherwise stocking sag is a problem.<br /><br />The front half is beautiful,  but the back half leaves something to be desired.  Because of my impatience, and the need for instant gratification, or Amazon's version of it which is next day in this case, I bought it from Amazon but I should have shelved my need for speed and ordered it cheaper .  I knew ,though, it would literally be on a slow boat from China (if it even arrived at all).  If I were you I'd go the China route.  It was only about $2.00 apiece and if they fell apart,  I could justify --because it only cost $2.00!!"
2.0,Way smaller It's more like an XL
2.0,Loved the color not the fit
2.0,"Tired of Chinese one size fits all. I'm a size 6, not small but not big either. I will no longer order sexy clothing from Amazon."
2.0,Very cute but very thin material and is see thru. Such a bummer.
2.0,The color is a more purple than blue. Also the little strings fell off as soon as I opened the package. Very disappointed.
2.0,Love the look and the size but the glass is incredibly fragile and breaks with only the slightest  bump
2.0,I'm 5'-6&#34; and it was very small and much shorter on me than appeared on the photo.
2.0,The size is great but the quality is poor.
2.0,"Based on reviews, I purchased 2 sizes larger than normal, fit perfect, but not loose like on the model. Stitches are cheap, came unraveled in 1 sleeve, so repaired before I wore."
2.0,A bit disappointed! I bought 2 of these sets totaling 12 bras for my 10 year old cause she’s needing them these days! I wrapped it to go under the Christmas tree for her!!<br />The quality seemed nice when I bought it but it’s only been about 3 weeks she’s been using them and already they are so worn out!!! She does not wear them more than one day at a time and I bought more than enough to go 2 weeks without washing so it’s not like they are worn down from over using!!!<br />The logos have peeled off<br />The padded lining is either gone from washing or bent and hard to fix!! There is a hole on 2 of the bras along the seem line and the material is much thinner! I am a fan of Bebe but this kids collection has been horrible lately!!<br />I am not happy that a month after her using I am already having to look somewhere and buy her more! I paid about $24 in all for these bras to wear down so fast!<br />The sizing is fairly accurate she is using a medium at 10 years old!<br />The elastic band is decently made but I have a feeling won’t be lasting either!!<br />Colors are as seen in pics!<br />Very disappointed at these bras... not to mention I also bought panties that are in worded shape<br />I would not be comfortable buying these again or recommending them...
2.0,"I guess they get an extra star because the frame is cute, but these are cheap and fit terribly. I guess your eyes won’t get damaged by the your screens if the frame is in your direct line of sight!"
2.0,"I like this skirt and wish I could rank it higher. However, the quality of the skirt is just plain crappy.<br /><br />For the pros: The colors are vibrant, material is thin and breezy but not see-through, and this pairs well with a variety of looks - from a crop top to a simple tank, all the way to a chambray shirt or denim jacket.  I have received several compliments while wearing it.<br /><br />The cons: This is constructed horribly; the most poorly-sewn garment I've purchased from Amazon.  The full length is way too long and will probably only work for very tall women.  But worse than that, the hemline of mine was completely crooked. I was unable to wear the shortest part in the front as shown because the right side was almost TWO inches longer than the left.  How does that happen??<br /><br />As a temporary fix, I wore it to the side and that actually provided a cute look.  But, because I missed the window to return this item, I ultimately had to pay to have this altered so it was wearable.  My seamstress also pointed out that the seam down the side was very  crooked.... it was not made at a right angle from the waist line, but instead at a diagonal.  So this caused her some more challenges and ultimately increased the price of alterations.<br /><br />Bottom line, I do this this is a gorgeous skirt, and I wear it often now that I have it altered.  But the price of the skirt + alteration wasn't worth it in the end.  The manufacturer really should be held accountable for how poorly executed the sewing and overall construction is.  As such, I do not recommend it to others."
2.0,"Nice sandals, but it’s too big. Please buy your exact size. I wore it for my birthday and it was way too big."
2.0,barely covers your toes and shrink when laundered
2.0,TOO SMALL NOT TRUE TO SIZE
2.0,I am 5’8 and this fit like a shirt. There is no way this could have passed as a dress
2.0,"good concept, way too thin of fabric. It's like I got first in a wet t-shirt contest without even getting wet. I ordered the white color so I guess shame on me. Never worn and sent to Goodwill."
2.0,"Love the look of the shoes, but man do they hurt. They little bow strap pressings against and into your toes. It was painful and left an indent. Would not buy again, due to this discomfort"
2.0,"The color of leggings faded away after first wash and material is too thin, they look like my kid was wearing them for ages 😭 I wish I had a replacement...."
2.0,The stainless steal looks like those fake material you buy off the street that would go black after wearing once. I didn't like it at all. Not a great gift idea.
2.0,The skirt fits but the top was giant. It also came snagged. If it wasnt for these problems I would of kept it since it is a really cute outfit.
2.0,A lot of them broke just trying to put them on.  And they are hard to put on if you don't have loose skin around your belly button.
2.0,"Works, cheap watch"
2.0,Wouldn’t say they’re the best quality. I guess for the price...
2.0,The color is diferent... is other Blue I dont like this Blue.
2.0,"The chain is too thin of gauge for the gauge of the circle. Nicely made, good be really lovely if it were better balanc"
2.0,I should have listened to the reviews... this is way too cropped and only covers your boobs. I will probably wear it over a bodycon dress or something but it’s not what I was imagining.
2.0,"My husband bought this backpack/purse for me, was a gift, he payed 50$ and I’m not sure why , it’s impossible to wear on the shoulder, extremely slippery, I went grocery shopping today with a toddler and I had such a hard time to take my backpack out and then put it in the cart and then taking the wallet out, told my husband to send it back"
2.0,Wish it was bigger. The maximum stretch is only fitting for a teenager.
2.0,"It’s a really cute design and the color is accurate, but if you have a large chest: Forget about it. Plus, I’m pretty sure once I wash it, it will probably shrink and I can turn it into a shirt for my chihuahua. So get excited for that."
2.0,"My sunglasses arrived damaged.  There was a line in the left lens, and it caused my vision to be distorted."
2.0,Beautiful bag but without the lining that comes with MK's bags.  Also there are 2 pockets in the bag but neither one have a zipper for safe keeping.  Not the interior I would expect from MK.
2.0,"I’m a size 8 (5’6 and weigh 144 pounds) bought a large because that’s usually the swim size that is for a person of my size and the bathingsuit was ridiculously tight, it barely fits my torso!!! Like I’m not that tall and it shouldn’t be this hard to get it over my shoulders. I’m pretty sure the product I got is severely defective. I’m not going to return it because the amazon return policy is crazy so I’ll just take my losses. Don’t buy unless if your a child’s size."
2.0,I’m only 5’ tall. This dress (and yes it was more of a dress than a sexy nighty) was way to long. The short side was past my knees. I returned it.
2.0,This is NOT full sized adult.
2.0,Silver colored coating is wearing off after only 2 months. It looks terrible. Cheap junk metal.
2.0,"The V neck is very low, I had to hide my bra, and the crop top lifts up. I got a large for references."
2.0,My daughter was so excited for her new slippers. She couldn’t wait to put them on. However one of the slippers is smaller than he other. Everest is smaller than Skye. These are literally two different slippers!
2.0,"I'm not sure what kind of human this is supposed to fit, but the cups stuck out like chasms from my chest and the straps were just as awkward. I was literally confused and thought maybe I'd done something wrong putting it on, but nope. It was just that bad. Return was quick and easy though."
2.0,It took 7 weeks to receive the shirt. It’s well made. The fit is at least one size small compared to most manufacturers. Go up 1-2 sizes.
2.0,"Unfortunately, these shoes were too small for my daughter.  I will be sending them back."
2.0,"These are very cute, but they did not stay on my sons feet for more than a few minutes at a time before slipping off"
2.0,I did not care for the parachute nylon type material. Very weird type of fabric to be wearing. I returned it
2.0,Really really tight
2.0,Seemed smaller than it should be.
2.0,Caps are way too small.
2.0,"The dresses are made for wide women.  I'm 5'3"" 100 lb.  The material was nice but the dress does not look like the photo.  The cut was off. Maybe because dress is made for wider women."
2.0,This wallet suck ! Cards are hard to get in and out . And its not ez to sit on.
2.0,Fits too close
2.0,"Fit it too small, I ordered an XL, but it fits like a small."
2.0,Love the pattern but way to large
2.0,"I would pay more for a larger pendant, it is too small for me to really enjoy it."
2.0,Bracelet is not a comfortable fit especially when wearing a long sleeve shirt.
2.0,"Too small,sent back."
2.0,I will have to wear it with straps other wise it won't stay up
2.0,"The description clearly states &#34;5 double-sided windows for cards or photos (10-places)&#34; ... The product I received only has 4 SINGLE-SIDED windows; so rather than 10 slots, there are 4. The [incredibly wasteful] packaging that the product COMES IN even says &#34;Durable vinyl 10-place book type window for photos, credit cards, etc.&#34;<br /><br />Additionally, the packaging also has a &#34;Suggested Retail&#34; of $1.19... Paying $1.19 for a 10-pocket plastic insert (about 12 cents per pocket) seems like a good deal, but paying $6.99 for a 4-pocket PLASTIC insert (about $1.75 per pocket) is a complete rip off.<br /><br />That being said, the product itself seems like good quality (I haven't put it to use yet, so we'll see.) But again, &#34;good quality&#34; for what one should pay really no more than $3 for..."
2.0,calf was very tight. i have a normal calf and it was too tight
2.0,These are awesome little finger lights....while they work. 14 out of the 40 came burnt out or the bulbs so dim it was only a matter of seconds before they died too.  Shame I have to return them. I purchased these before and the Kids loved them.  But even with that purchase quite a few were defective.
2.0,all rhinestones were broken very bad product
2.0,"These are not snug fit.  I think they are also a little shorter in the waist than I like too.  (Where my kid outgrows first). The color is also slightly lighter lavender than expected.  They are not cotton, but not that silky nightgown material either."
2.0,These are dry fit tank tops - NOTHING compression about these.. how can they be? thin as a piece of paper!!
2.0,The fit is a little loose and the cut is not as I expected.
2.0,This shoe fit much smaller than Tiempos normally fit. Very bizarre. May have to go up a full size.
2.0,Split down both sides
2.0,I ordered a 42C (ALL my bras are 42c so yes I know my size) and this was terribly small. The cup size was more like a B and the band was more like a 38. It was very small. 2 stars because while it did not fit it was still a cute and sturdy bra. If you wear a smaller size you may have better luck than I did. Thankfully Amazon accepts returns!
2.0,"Pineapple wore off really fast and the clasp broke, just feels cheap"
2.0,Did not look like the pic advertised. The scarf is big and does not look pretty like the picture. I like that the fabric is thin.
2.0,"The bra is made well and the customer service was very good but it is definitely not for for bigger chested women. I'm in my forties a, c to d cup and wobbled right out of the cups."
2.0,It is very cheap material and runs very short.
2.0,"finally got here today, so the shipping was much quicker than expected. the problem is when i opened the packaged where you squeezethe ring to fit on your finger it was a little cracked. Then later itstarted breaking more and it finally snapped in half... Onlyhad it for a few hours.<br />Ohwell timetogo find that glue gun."
2.0,"The top was too large although I followed the sizing, but not too big of a deal. The worst part was the seam where the black and white fabrics intersect was not sewn all the way together, creating a nice keyhole appearance right on top of my muff! Easy fix for someone who sews, unfortunately not me. Bottoms fit fine otherwise, material quality was ok."
2.0,"These earrings are 2 different colors.... but it not super noticeable, just annoying. i will still wear them."
2.0,Beautiful top...Fits ok but sleeves are tight.
2.0,"Very soft fabric, the sewing was OK on mine.  But the fabric is like cotton underwear, very thin. If you have any cellulite – – and who doesn’t? – – It’s going to show.  Yes, the fabric is that thin.  Almost too vulgar to wear outside your house.  But for just relaxing around the house, or for sleepwear, these would be adequate. The colors are beautiful. But they are useless to me and I wish that I had returned them when I had the chance."
2.0,This top doesn't look at all like it did online. It is more see through and fit way too big. It didn't complement my shape in a flattering way at all. I was planning to wear it to work with a skirt but now I will be wearing it at home around the house on days I'm not planning to go out at all. It is only good for a junk garment to wear when nobody will be seeing you.
2.0,"Such a cute dress, but I had to return because it was incredibly small through the chest and shoulders ☹️"
2.0,"At first sight the wallet looks really nice, it has plenty of space for cards, and it has nice stitches. However, after using it for 2 weeks it started to show signs of wear that I did not expect. According to the description of the item, it is made of goat leather; however, it looks more like some kind of low quality &#34;vinyl&#34;. I really like the design of this wallet but its durability is very dissappointing. I cannot imagine how it is going to look after a couple of months. In summary, I would not recommend this wallet to a friend."
2.0,Did not like the material or looks of it
2.0,"Fit is fine, fabric isn't great. Felt like I got it at Rite Aid in the clothing section."
2.0,"I really liked this bracelet. It was cool with a handmade look to it. Everyone that saw it gave compliments. Aside from the clasp, I'd say the quality was good. The materials looked like quality stuff - real leather and metal and not plastic. The clasp, however, is absolute crap. It looks nice but comes apart way too easily. It came apart on its own at least once every time I wore it. Unfortunately, I lost the bracelet in less than 2 weeks. As much as I like the look, I wouldn't buy it again unless they improve the clasp. Literally anything would be better than the current design."
2.0,"The socks are not as tall as they look, they sit right above the ankle.  The black socks gets fuzzy after one wear."
2.0,"Don't fit well, its more long."
2.0,"I own a Grooming salon...upon holding the gloves I knew cats would easily penetrate those gloves.<br />Now claws on a ferrets, rabbit or some other small pet you’d be fine. But a fearful or stressed cat or dog these gloves simply don’t have the adequate protection.  If your seeking something more heavy duty think along the lines of a harder rubber type glove."
2.0,Love the color but they were too big to put in my upper ear hole... so it was a waste of money for me :( and i was really excited for them...
2.0,"Fabric not as expected, as it's see thru."
2.0,"Too small, no stretch"
2.0,Costume watch at the very very best.
2.0,Not very happy with this insoles seem very cheaply made.  I had  to cut them down to fit my shoes so I cant get my money back but thats what I want.
2.0,"I have ordered 4 dresses from this company and none of them fit properly. I ordered 8-9 and it fit like a 10-11 year old.<br />The red with fluffy skirt looks cheap, poor quality material and even though I ordered 7-8 it was way too loose on my 8yr old. She is roughly 52lbs.<br /><br />The red with tulle skirt (7-8) fit like a 5yr old in hight and 10yr old in width. Also the trim was poorly done.<br /><br />The blue one is beautiful (7-8)and does look nice but was way too short on the chest area which made the skirt way shorter. It would fit a 5yr old in hight. The width was not bed, it fit ok not too loose but the hight measurements were all wrong. Returning all of them."
2.0,Really really wanted to love this wallet but the zipper came broken. Now I'm stuck traveling with nowhere to store my coins :(
2.0,They turned the color of copper within a month...<br />They were cute
2.0,"I love the boots, but I am incredibly disappointed that the box was shredded. I keep my boots in the UGG box and am unable to do this as the shoes were obviously returned and the box was destroyed. They should have discounted the shoes as a result!"
2.0,Made super small bought large and they might fit a small.
2.0,"Poorly made,fabric falls apart"
2.0,The plane looks nice but the hole that the bracelet goes through is excessively wide.....so it doesn't work well with stoppers.
2.0,Thought it would be a little bigger
2.0,It's light but ok
2.0,Too big. Not in love with the fabric. I usually wear a medium and this medium was way too big....I wanted this to work but didn't...looks like a maternity shirt.
2.0,Did not last more than two weeks.
2.0,My son loved the shirt but after short I usage and few washings I found a hole in the shirt. This is disappointing as he loves the shirt
2.0,One of the diamonds fell off just at few months after getting them. Disappointed. I hope they’ll replace them.
2.0,"Actual item is more flimsy. Clasp arrived broken but it will cost 5 times the value of the item to return it. Will have to take the loss,"
2.0,Smear and do not seem &#34;clear&#34; enough to see well
2.0,It's ok...
2.0,The shorts fit great. The fixed internal pad was huge and not at all comfortable. Ended up cutting out the pad and using the shorts with a separate liner and pad combo.
2.0,"Well, you get what you pay for. This ate my car keys and my taser within a few weeks, the lining ripped and thank goodness the canvas held, I'd have been real mad otherwise. Good sized bag but poor materials."
2.0,"The color is sprayed on and rubs off easily. I’ve only been wearing my band a week, with only gentle use, and the color is rubbing off. The band itself is comfortable and stays on, but I purchased it for the color."
2.0,"The bra performed as expected (good for yoga, but not enough support for high-impact/cardio workouts), but the straps were, unfortunately, a deal-breaker for me - they never lay flat and are made of a rather itchy material that irritated my skin."
2.0,"These cami's are just okay. They are cheaply made and I don't like the way the plastic hooks on the straps feel. I've had similar ones before and have had problem's with the plastic hooks breaking. I found better quality cami's that feel great at New York and Co. for $9.99 apiece, and are much better quality, so I am returning these."
2.0,Two stars for awesome fabric but the strings were too short and the biggest size was teeny and I’m not that big and I gave to my daughter who is tiny and it’s still small on her . 3xl fits a c/d at best and don’t be over a size 6
2.0,Boots are a little snuggle for the size. Had to stretch toe box. Otherwise boots are super cute.
2.0,"Disappointed in this cardigan--it didn't fit, nor looked as attractive as the way the picture made it appear it would."
2.0,"Wanted to love it, proportions were off. Sleeves, chest  & waist were enormous,  while hips fit as expected."
2.0,..... lo pudo lucir una sola vez..... despues se desarmo.
2.0,This is a beautiful dress but it runs small and was a little too short for my liking. I am usually a medium and I tried a large and it was still just a tad snug.
2.0,Cute but took weeks to receive
2.0,Nice pants.  About 4 sizes smaller than tagged.
2.0,This top was incredibly boxy and too short to wear tied at the waist as shown. Also the material was not comfortable
2.0,Could not get the band to seat on the watch with an hour of serious effort. Ended up cannibalizing parts to give a few more months of life to my broken band.
2.0,This would be for a large headed person.
2.0,Order a size up or two.<br />Completely see through but it is nice fabric.
2.0,After a few wear the snap holding the band on to the watch face cracked off and it will no longer clip into the fitbit....
2.0,"Cute top, but the pants had heavy elastic in the waist. Had to return them."
2.0,"Really cutie and picture shows true, however after  about a dozen wearing large pieces on the top of the boot at the toe break has come off."
2.0,one of the pieces was missing and chain to latch to is very flimsy and does not seem to be as long as the description...it looks better in the picture
2.0,"Did not like fabric,or the fit..."
2.0,"I am sure it will do what is needed, but it isn't very pretty and certainly isn't at all attractive."
2.0,ordered a large thinking it would work for a size 12. more like a 6 or an 8.
2.0,This item has start turning colors
2.0,Ball keeps falling off after it was cut to size
2.0,"it looks nothing, I mean nothing like the picture in online"
2.0,Cheap material and seemed flimsy.
2.0,Cheaply made. Returned it
2.0,"I didn't like it because it wasn't Sterling silver and I thought it was a little big for the Pandora bracelet, so I sent it back."
2.0,"So, the birth months are February, July, November, and March in THAT order. I understand that they are simulated but the fact that the Amethyst is not purple.... That's a severe irritation point for me. I'm not sure it's even a simulated amethyst. Other than that, it's great. Unfortunately, my daughter noticed the mistake so my mother will as well. It sucks because this was a Christmas gift to her and I've waited 3 weeks for this to arrive. Thank you for spelling their names correctly, I just wish the birth stones would have been accurate as well. 😐 I would have given this review 5 stars had everything been accurate."
2.0,Pretty skirt way to small even being an Xl
2.0,"Poor quality. Thin. Pants super long (I’m 5’6”), so must be worn with a higher heel. Looked nice from a distance."
2.0,I had a pair of kodiak boots that I absolutely loved. I wore them like crazy the past 4 years and thought it was time to get a new pair. I tried this style out with high hopes. Unfortunately it does not fit well around my ankle and lower leg. It's too large. It rubs against my heels causing a blisters and is not a good fit for my foot shape. My other boots took some time to brake in so I decided to wear them a handful of times to see if they would mild toy for better. Unfortunately they haven't. I'm so sad about it. Because I wore them I don't think I can return them now which is super disappointing because they're not cheap!  I wish I would have ordered the other style I originally had.
2.0,"not slim fit at all. waist was true to size, but pants were very loose"
2.0,"The quality sucks and it broke upon arrival. However, it was a cute concept and was inexpensive."
2.0,The cross was too big for the bracelet.
2.0,"I've had these now for about almost 3 months after switching from Rainbow sandals. The bottle opener on the bottom is cool however, these sandals are not as comfortable and are now starting to fall apart. The rubber bottom is coming apart from the bottom of the sandal. My sister purchase a different pair of reef sandals and was raving about them, I so purchased these. I would not recommend buying this particular sandal as they are not comfortable and fall apart."
2.0,"Cute and comfy dress, but as soon as I tried it on I noticed a large hole in the back! Very sad to have to send this back. There was no exchange option, so I have to go through the return process and then repurchase if I want a (hopefully) whole garment. A little inconvenient."
2.0,Surprise! The stitching came apart the first day I used it. I sewed it back up and am using it as a foot stool.
2.0,even stiches are not finished
2.0,It might be my apple-shaped body but this was not flattering at all.  No bust support and very thin material.
2.0,The dta 800 came with a red & black wire where it says 120v. My repairman is afraid that it will fry because every says 120v except a label placed on the box by ASA electronics.
2.0,"I so wanted to like this dress, but the cutout back is right over the bra strap. A little higher or lower and it would have been a keeper, but I can't skip the bra and those sticky bras aren't fooling anyone."
2.0,Color is far different then expected
2.0,"Somewhat small, if it came in one more size bigger"
2.0,"Fitted way too small, thank you."
2.0,"The colors in these photos are very deceiving. They all look very dull and lifeless in real life, especially when wearing them. I can't tell what color they're supposed to be when I look in the mirror. And somehow all of them look like the same muted color. I wouldn't buy these again, that's for sure."
2.0,"For some reason, I read that this was a 2 pack, but did not screen shot it so can not prove it. I would not have paid $40 for one pair of underwear. I had a c-section 5 days ago and was excited to try these on when my husband brought them to me. I have been wearing a medium or large maternity clothing up to delivery day. I ordered the L/XL. The first thing I noticed was that I could barely get the waistband around my thighs. I powered through as I thought that would mean awesome compression on my stomach area. After doing some sort of inchworm manuever and getting them on, I then failed at multiple attempts to keep the top from rolling down my back. After rationalizing that a back muffin-top would not be that much different than what I already look like, I moved on to the other aspects of the panties. It had some sort of compression on my upper ribs, but about the same as an old shapewear pair I bought from Target for less than half the price. Along my incision, it didn't have much more compression than my regular panties,  but since these are high waist, they don't dig into the incision either. I don't have a very big butt (thanks, mom) and the fabric on my butt seemed a little loose, while still overly squeezing my thighs, creating a mushroom effect there as well. I had a reaction to the iodine cleanser, so my thighs are rather sensitive and having them sqeezed to death was more than a little unpleasant. I walked around in them a bit, to see if maybe I just needed to ""loosen them up"" or something. Lack of sleep will make you have strange rationalization skills.  Eventually, I gave up and took them off and have requested a refund."
2.0,The frames of the glasses and the hinges seem to be made very well but the lenses did not seem to block the sun out very well and i was getting glare from the mirrored lenses. and also these glasses are really big
2.0,"I've loved the UK issue smocks, I have one in DPM, one in DDPM and one in MTP.  I wanted a plain colour to wear around town without being the guy in camo.  The design is great, its the latest version of the smock.  The one failure I find in this is the original issue smocks are windproof, while this one is not, and that makes a huge difference because now it's not actually a useful garment, now it's just fashion."
2.0,Awful material. Also does not fit well especially around the shoulder/ underarm. Save your money.
2.0,Very tight on the arms and shoulders. Got pretty small (even though I ordered my size). VERY SEE THROUGH. The back you can see everything but the front is too see through to go braless unless you are wearing nipple covers...
2.0,Toop ddnt fit me nd im pissed cuz i orderd the right size
2.0,sized incorrectly
2.0,The seam tore on the first use. My daughter was so upset! They are poorly sewn together.
2.0,"Looks very good, even though you can feel that is not the best material. Shoes where too hard for my daughter, she kept complaining, and eventually returned it."
2.0,Necklace lights do not work after a mere twenty minutes of wear. Not worth any investment if they can't stay lit more than 20 minutes.
2.0,This is a lovely piece.<br />Not likely to wear because of difficulty taking off. ( best to include instructions)<br />Or not?
2.0,"This was the first time I bought from this seller. I must have overlooked or not read the reviews. It's not quite what I expected. When I see maziar dress I think flowy not just long. This is pretty much a long straight dream. There is no give in the fabric at all. I wear a US 14-16 so I purchased a XX-Large  It feels like a large, so maybe go up 2 to 3 more sizes I'd you want the flow. The color was okay,  not as bright as in the picture.  But I am of the philosophy you get what you pay for, so I can only be $22 or so worth of disappointment....lol"
2.0,"I couldn't get the neckline to sit any way that looked the least bit flattering or even passable. The material has a nice feel and the green is very pretty, but spending a good five minutes time fiddling with the neckline and still not succeeding is a deal breaker for me. The sizing seems accurate and I don't believe that's an issue. I wouldn't reorder it."
2.0,"Looks very cheap, but then again it was so..."
2.0,Print is not as bright as the picture. Probably i got this at lesser price in ebay for the same quality.
2.0,These gloves are poorly designed.  Maybe for a child.
2.0,This is not very strong and the back pin broke off the first day I got them without much use at all
2.0,"It is a good quality, but the color was not really Tiffany blue.  It was more like Robin's Egg blue."
2.0,"I love the style and the look, but upon arrival the post was bent completely sideways from shipment."
2.0,"Well, the large was really tight across the bust and I am 5’2” and 128 pounds and wear a Size 10-12. Cute print but felt this was really for a person not too busty or maybe a junior size."
2.0,"I will probably keep this, but it will be because I have removed the lining of the beanie and the company probably would not return it. Honestly, I really did want this. I wear my hair in a ponytail that is higher up on my head, and this beanie would be perfect for me! If it didn't itch so freaking much!!<br />I'm not allergic to this material, I have a sweater that is made of of the same thing and I love it! But this beanie is just too itchy. I have tried making some adjustments to help with the itchiness, but at some point, I just have to let it go.<br />The control panel is also another thing. It's circular, but the button pad is square. So when you go to use the buttons, the control panel will shift on you. It's super annoying when you're at work and you're trying to skip a song, but end up pausing the song over and over and you have to stop what you're doing just to use your phone to change the song...at this point, it's not worth it.<br /><br />So, to sum up, the design it a good idea! I loved it! The liner is a bit much for me, but good if it's extremely cold where you're at. The material is itchy for me. And maybe if they use a control panel that is square, it will work out better."
2.0,Didnt stay on it smudged if you touched your face
2.0,"It’s like you’re wearing a bag... no shape, nothing. I really like the picture but when you get it it’s nothing similar!"
2.0,The backs are too loose. Lost an earring at work.
2.0,Way too small! May fit my 11 year old!
2.0,"Were good shoes for about a week. Not good quality, fell apart very quickly"
2.0,"Overall I like the glasses. However, the outer lens coating starting to come off after 2 months of me wearing them. I was careful when cleaning them and using the supplied cleaning towel. I wont buy them again because of this issue. I have to throw away a perfectly good pair of glasses due to not being able to see out of them. Not good!"
2.0,"Keep in mind, the pattern you see that ""lights up"" is a cardboard cut out. Will absolutely get destroyed in any kind of moisture. Being that these are listed when you search for ""Ski mask"" or ""face warmer"" it's a bit misleading"
2.0,"Anything 14mm and up isn’t that great, it’s too thin so it easily tears. I Would keep shopping and look for something thicker."
2.0,I was hoping for a snugger fit but on my face is is too loose and does not stay up well.  I have not used it in any of its other configurations.
2.0,The kidney belt velcro had both sides the hook velcro. Rather than one side being loop velcro and on side being hook velcro. So it wouldn’t stay secured. Rivets didn’t look to me like they would last. But for the money. It’s not a bad value. Typical of Chinese made products.
2.0,"Got a large bc of the height measurements. I'm 6ft and it was giving me a camel toe, or should I say knuckle.. The gold accents were peeling right off. Returned it"
2.0,In America 3x is big this shirt was like maybe a large in American sizes. I couldn't even get both arms in barley got one arm. I love the design and I would love to tell my friends where I got it but I can't.
2.0,I like the sturdy frames but I do not like the glasses. The lenses I thought were a much darker blue in color but they are far from what you see in the picture. I do t like seeing my eyes. To me that’s not sunglasses.
2.0,these do not block the sun at all if you are looking to keep the sun out of your eyes do not buy these if you are just looking for glasses to wear then these are your glasses
2.0,The hat I noticed is to big where the patch is you can't see it good. Thanks
2.0,These are thin and see through and i am so bummed. The last time i ordered these leggings they were awesome and have been my favorite workout pants. I ordered 3 pairs recently and even the legs are see through. Lame.
2.0,"* The ear loops are too short, and not adjustable at all. It's painful to wear for any length of time.<br />* The metal piece that's supposed to help fit the mask around the nose is loose inside the mask. I had to work it up into place and then add a few stitches to keep it there."
2.0,Runs a little big. Made of cheap<br />Material. You get what you pay for!
2.0,I found it it was hidden I like it
2.0,I did not care for the style. No place to put your credit cards. Its not an organizing purse. Its pretty though. The size is nice.
2.0,"I like the material and pockets.  My only complaint is that the sizing is way off.  I would usually wear a large, and I wanted them looser, so I ordered an extra large, but it fits like a medium."
2.0,The lining was much shorter than the length of pants.  Too short
2.0,"Update: Seller returned full refund. I would have preferred accurate lenses since the frame and lights are good enough.<br />The item must be 1/2&#34; from lenses and if you want to see with both eyes, the item becomes out of focus. The strengths are not more than what you would get with a 2.50x $10 pair of reading glasses. At least with the reading glasses you can use both eyes. I believe that the two comments for this item cannot be true. The item came from Guangdong. I requested a refund and a label to return the item and they only offered to refund 1/2 the price (no return label)."
2.0,"Sizing info is not accurate.  Description says one size fits most teens, but it is WAY too tight for my average sized 9 year old."
2.0,I am 5'3 at 140lbs. These are made of women under 100lbs or a woman with zero curves. Good material.
2.0,Too big.  Looked wide and frumpy.  Very soft and comfortable though.  I guess I need to order a smaller size. Ordered a large and it was way too big.
2.0,"Great dress cut, but material thicker than usual (I have it in 3 other colors), so it flows differently and looks less elegant, more like thick t-shirt material. Returning."
2.0,I really liked the dress. very slimming. For me I had to return it as it was cut to high on the chest/neck area. It was cutting/rubbing into my neck. It felt like I was choking. No one mentioned that on their reviews...If it wasn't for that I would've kept it.
2.0,Iridescent part peels off after a week of wear.
2.0,"I would say that if you have a wide foot or bunions that this shoe may be a tad bit narrow for you. I wore these to work today and they were so uncomfortable. The shoe flopped from the back every time I took a step but the front of the shoe is narrow that it squeezes the walls of my feet, leaving marks and discomfort. I noticed that the sole inside one of the shoes started to peel back. There is no cushion inside and it feels as if you are walking on a hard surface.I'm disappointed because this shoe seemed as if it had potential given the affordable price."
2.0,Beautiful but turns you green
2.0,"The design of these shorts are great, but they run very small. I’ve washed the shorts 2 times and dry hung them and there is already some wear and tear on the shorts. I ran it on a delicate cycle on my new Samsung washer. Hope these shorts can last longer."
2.0,Not a very good swim suit. Fabric cheap feeling.
2.0,Weird color. Feels and look poor quality. I think it is over prized.
2.0,These were pretty cute but 2 out of 4 of these broke so easily while I was trying to put them in my ears.
2.0,"Maybe my kids got a big head, but he freaked when I put it over him to get on. Too tight"
2.0,Returned this.  It was lined which I thought was great.  But the lining is the same print so I had sunflowers popping through in random places.  Not cute.
2.0,"Totally a different necklace than the one pictured.  I don't hate it enough to return it, but I might give it away to a friend because it is NOT the one in the picture and I never would have ordered the one I received."
2.0,Great PJ's but I had to give them to my daughter as they are waaaay to small for anyone with boobs.
2.0,Washed it in cold water no detergent. The red colors ran dyed the white
2.0,Thought these would look really well on me until I received them and put them on. They were uncomfortable to wear for a long period of time. Buckles were irritating and the holes for adjustment look terrible.
2.0,I ordered based off size chart... the item was too short and I am only 5'4&#34; It was tight and bunched up in the legs. Bought another from lulus fit much better
2.0,"This and concept is a great idea as an optional laptop sleeve. However, it  does not fit a 15 inch laptop as you know it. I'm hoping this fabric will give in & my 15 inch Lenovo will eventually fit. Look at the measurements before you buy it's not for a tablet  it seems specifically made for apple and a Mac that is a 15 inch.  I about broke off my thumbs forcing my laptop in - my dell 15 inch doesn't fit at all -  if this does not break the material with an easier glide into the main pocket it's going to get returned. Again good idea poor design or description! not that great for the price. Absolutely ridiculous amount for this product. Go get a laptop sleeve for 10 bucks with the pocket you'll be happier at least you'll have handles<br /><br />Update - picture of 15 lenovo flex 15 in as you does not fit & again my 15 inch dell doesnt fit at all, perhaps seller should change description that it fits 13 inch the best"
2.0,Material is cheap. Rough and thin.
2.0,My bracelet turned on black
2.0,"One of the other reviews shows this, but in the sellers' pictures, all the fans seem to point to the side, but they actually face forward, so when they were extended, they were constantly hitting my cheeks and just didn't sit well. They *are* good quality and I liked them otherwise, but a 90 degree angle rotation would have been so much nicer."
2.0,The nose was falling off of one witch and the jacket  was coming off another. Poor quality.
2.0,Not comfortable and doesn’t fit right
2.0,"The material not great, worn one time and the material torn!"
2.0,Love how they fit but they are not true to size im 5'2 150 i ordered a large i could of gotten XL and been a lot more comfy
2.0,No es bueno por el precio!
2.0,cuts my ear after a while..
2.0,"Just didn't like, I returned it."
2.0,Coat is too short for 24m old.  Lifting arms exposes the belly.
2.0,I would have been better off if these had been straight stainless steel instead of Rhodium plated since the Rhodium seems to have caused an allergic reaction. I had raw lobes for over a week. Be careful if you have any sensitivities to metal.
2.0,"Although I love the price and the variety of colors these straps come in, they don't stay on my glasses.  I'm always losing them, as the straps easily slip off the frames.  Maybe if I got larger glasses they would work, but I'm not interested in changing out my glasses just so these straps will work.  Highly disappointed."
2.0,I bought white and black. Black one had a defect where the spring bar lever (?) broke off after i put it on. I couldn't get the band off...so i ended up cutting the band a bit and used a knife...it took me over 30 minutes to get it off. I was told that u would get a replacement but it has been 3 weeks...I'll update on whether they actually follow through their promises or not.
2.0,"Very big, fabric was not good"
2.0,"This is basically see through, you can see the padding in the white one. Also it’s tiny, so even ordering a size up it’s too small if you have a chest."
2.0,Fell apart in 6 months
2.0,"Expected to use for the holiday season, but disappointing.  One size DOES NOT fit most.  I'm 5""11, 220 and wear a 44-46.  Jacket is snug, I could barely get hat on without the wig and couldn't even get the boot covers over my feet.  My wife is 5'2"" 120 and she could barely get the boot covers on.  Needless to say I returned it."
2.0,Zipper does not stay up.
2.0,"I’m a bit disappointed because I absolutely love the pattern of this band, however it seems to be made for a more petite human. I attempted to wear this but after 10 mins it was cutting off the circulation in my hand so I had to put my other band back on."
2.0,"After 10 minutes of wearing these eyeglasses (body heat?) they begin to smell of chemcals really bad. I assume some sort of plastic outgassing. I returned them, got a replacement set hoping for a better batch. Update: replacement set also stinks badly, make my eyes burn, headache. I am putting them outside in the sun hoping for complete outgassing so that they will be wearable. If this does not work I will have to return them again."
2.0,runs small and tight
2.0,"Took two months to ship. When it finally got here it was wet. At first I thought it was a delivery issue but it hadn’t rained in a while, the shirt was wrapped in two layers of plastic, and the outside of the package was not wet at all. The shirt was ok, a bit thinner than I expected. Just really irritated at the shipping issues."
2.0,"I was hoping these shorts would be soft, but they are very very stiff.  Overall they are made well, and have very nice pockets, but they may be the stiffest shorts I have ever felt.  And, since they have teflon treatment on them, they don't soften with washing."
2.0,This product kept making my skin break out.
2.0,The strap's electricity was worn and not fitted according to the size.
2.0,"You get what you pay for, the apostrophe was not there on the shirt so when you stand back it looks like it says “IT  SMY  BIRTHDAY”"
2.0,beautiful but the clasps are not reliable - they broke
2.0,Some colors such as pink and lighter blue run a whole size smaller than other colors
2.0,Too lacy not flattering for plus size figure
2.0,Returned them without exchange.  They have too much padding/insulation.
2.0,Too SHORT!  Stop making workout tanks so short!
2.0,The tool it came with wouldn’t unscrew. It was stuck in there so I can’t get the links off. Tried everything. No w I have to go pay to have it done
2.0,"I loved this dress unfortunately, I hand washed this dress in cold water and the black ran throughout the yellow and white.  Many attempts to repair unsuccessful.  It is a great dress if YOU DONT WASH IT."
2.0,I was looking for something that I could wrap around and wear to church and sorority  meetings which I hoped would be heavier.  However when the item came it was very thin and I was very disappointed . If you want an lightweight shawl for spring or summer wear. This will be an great buy.
2.0,This item is not white but gray
2.0,Swimsuit is good for smaller top women
2.0,I liked material.  And followed the size chart.  Also went up 1 size and still small.<br />I normally wear L and 2x was to small.<br />If u are blessed with a butt.  Order 3x or<br />Larger
2.0,Did not like the quality of this product it ran way too big and did not like the colors looks very outdated would not recommend
2.0,This was ordered for my son as a 2x and product was way small was not a 2x
2.0,"feel like cardboard, with a decal pasted on it, not worth the money"
2.0,"Not a fan of the brassy color honestly. I prefer more of a golden tone. These are ok, just not exactly what I was expecting"
2.0,Was not meant to fit a human.
2.0,Just as described but a little long
2.0,"Sorry but this is embarrassingly cheap looking. I didn't expect much for the price and I'll wear it with the costume for the party but after that, may be donation to a thrift shop? It looks for all the world like plastic beads, though the sound made when they click against each other indicates glass-like material."
2.0,"The fabric of the black tank was perfect! It had more compression than the other two and felt a little thicker. The red one was fine. The pink one was shorter than the other two. Fabric of those two were way thinner than the black, but colors are really nice.  If I would buy again, I'd buy the black."
2.0,One size fits all!?? Too large!
2.0,I knew it was a &#34;JKL&#34; diamond but was disappointed - it is very cloudy and does not sparkle.<br />The chain is very fine.
2.0,"Very cute.<br />Pros: very quiet and warm. Packs tremendously small and washes well.<br />Cons: no real structure underfoot, and not very difficult to walk right out of them. Will not last long."
2.0,"Initially it wa great, just what i wanted, a clear slime line case. I bought this in late November but I finally gave up on it at the end of June as it had discolored severely and looked like it been in an old smoke filled bar for years."
2.0,"The charms isn't evenly numbered.. I got ONE ""L"" but NINE ""J"", SEVEN ""X"", ONE ""U""... I mean what kind of foolery is this??? Very disappointed"
2.0,"Purchased this for my daughter. .. it must've been stored in a place with heavy mildew,  because the whole necklace reeks of it. We had to throw away the leather cord because my daughter's asthma became very worrisome if she had it on.  Wet tried soaking it in bleach and in vinegar, but eventually just threw it out.  ... very pretty pendant, larger than anticipated,  but still very pretty."
2.0,Size is smaller than chart indicates<br />Had to give away
2.0,Bought for my daughter and she wears a size 9/10 in shoe and they would fit if they weren’t so tight. She can’t even get her foot all the way in.
2.0,these were a gift for my mom for Christmas and within 20 minutes of her wearing them the thumb seam split open. She was not doing anything physically demanding at all and she has small hands. There was no reason for these to come apart within 20 minutes of wear.
2.0,The bottoms fit but the top was about 2 sizes too small and my daughter is a skinny girl.
2.0,Hat was really small
2.0,I ordered saffron yellow and it came dark orange. FYI if you want yellow don't buy it here. Extremely disappointed in the color but otherwise good hat for the price.
2.0,"One great feature is the UV protection.  Thats it. For a very cheap price, its actually pretty good during the day while driving."
2.0,"I’m 5’6”, 140 lbs, working on losing my pooch, and this (size Medium) just wasn’t flattering on me at all. No matter how I pulled or moved the waistband around, I looked like a lumpy sack. For over $40, I don’t think this simple dress would be worth the money even if it looked great on me. It’s just tshirt material, and I got a dress like this at Costco for $15 that lays much better, without bunching or sticking. It’s pretty on the model, but too expensive."
2.0,"Run tight and small<br />Well made, just tight for an elderly man"
2.0,Didn't like it in person.  Looks really cheap.
2.0,"SIZE UP, RUNS SMALL!!!!!"
2.0,"I wanted a high waisted pants for awhile now and when I came across this pants on Amazon I decided to purchase it. When I received it I was a bit disappointed, and here's is why. The material looks bes very cheap and it wasn't true to size. So that's why i had to return it, this might work out for someone else,  but i'm sorry this wasn't for me."
2.0,My daughter did a lot of running at the beach and the inside edge stitching gave her a skin rash/irritation. Now she doesn’t want to wear the again.
2.0,"It fits the watch great. Said it comes with a tool to adjust the links, it does NOT come with the tool. It is bulky but pretty. There is no button/tab to contact the seller either. The only reason I gave it 2 stars is because I DO like the color."
2.0,I do not like the white inside and it does not fit wall
2.0,"Looked very cute and at least a little durable, but does not fit like a large! My friend bought one as well and had the same issues. Only recommend for smaller chested women"
2.0,I was really excited to wear this. Unfortunately when I put it on it was restricting in the arms I couldn't lift them up past my shoulders and it was very tight around my body it was hard to breathe
2.0,"They are okay, but will not purchase anymore, ever!"
2.0,Bottom of Umbrella pole was broken upon delivery - looking to return product for refund.
2.0,Material is like a Halloween Costume was not expecting that otherwise for Halloween ok not for work.
2.0,"Extremely nice bracelet, unfortunately it's BABY size. Too small even for my 14 year old daughter."
2.0,These are okay but a little small for my 11 month old's feet. He is a 5 foot size and these just fit him. He will definitely grow out of these in a few months. I have this a 2 out of 5 because I found another seller that sold exactly the same socks but for much less (by Totmart).
2.0,The band looks quite nice but the issue I have with it is the the closing mechanism isn't very good at all. I am using the band for 2 days now and I had it several times were it just opened itself....especially annoying while driving.
2.0,This product is thin and uncomfortable.
2.0,"These come in a pack of three. One of the three had a bad snag in it before I even took it out of its package. As other reviewers stated, these are a very thin Jersey material. I personally don’t like the fit at all. They are much larger towards the bottom which is annoying and makes the fit look huge. Not practical for working out in as the material wouldn’t hold up."
2.0,"Its pretty much the material of most plus size womens tops. It wears like anight gown u tied a rope around. Notflattering AT ALL as a dress. Its also shorterthen the picture so on the plus side, I hiked it up, french tucked the bottom n its a blouse with pockets lol."
2.0,"I bought according to measurements and when I received ( beautiful) dress , it was extremely big, buy two sizes down according to chart. Material is soft, print is beautiful , and flow is elegant."
2.0,"I like this a bit and I don't more.  The fake (they call it ""PU Leather"") suede leather of the main black bag is nice looking. Then, attached is a shiny ""PU"" patent leather small purse bag.  Not removable, as I thought it may be when I first looked at it. But attached. So it contrasts very much and the smaller shiny section really doesn't help the look to me.  Though it is a smart idea, and is handy.  The main purse section is one large opening when you zip it open.  That's good. There is also a zippered separate compartment inside halfway down on the purse for stashing, although it does slightly show through the bag if you put in anything bumpy, like keys.  The strap is also a mix of fake leather and sort of cheap feeling chain. I like the look of that, but the chain itself feels like it has a plastic coating or something. The shoulder bag also has a bottom that is soft and not necessarily stable on a table.  It also comes with a bonus large ""grocery"" size bag, a nice extra. That is thick plastic with the logo on it.  I don't like the fact that they now call fake leather ""PU"" with no explanation.  I also think the bag design is not very well thought out for functionality. It can't figure out what it wants to be."
2.0,Worst sizing ever
2.0,"Love the price for the 14K white gold, nice shiny CZ’s perfect size for my second & third ear piercings but the post is so short they barely fit in my ear. It’s as if these are made for small children and not adults. Very disappointing..."
2.0,The material was very thin. No support w/ okay coverage. It was too big for me personally. I ordered a large. Probably should’ve ordered a medium.
2.0,"Pretty flimsy construction. Very light weight material, arrived folded pretty small and I was unable to get it to retain a decent shape. For this reason, I ended up returning."
2.0,"Zipper broke within 2 days of use, poorly made and hard to use."
2.0,"This top looks like a rag in comparison the the elegant looking &#34;sweater&#34; on the model.  It is not a &#34;sweater&#34; as described by the seller, it is a thin knit material and the sleeves are tighter, and there is a banded bottom.  It is fine for working out, I guess, but I am pretty disappointed."
2.0,Didn't fit my phone
2.0,Pictures aren't very good. But the glowing Stargate is just a sticker on a generic pocketwatch. Not worth buying.
2.0,You can see right through it so you will need a slip
2.0,Lamentablemente me enviaron un talle que no era el correcto y era un regalo que viajo hacia otro pais.
2.0,It broke after few using unfortunately. Very gentle
2.0,"I just received the product yesterday and Iam disappointing ,because I thought I’m getting 2 stretchers.<br />I just have 1 stretcher and a brush!!!<br />I don’t need a funny brush !!"
2.0,I wore them twice. They got a hole in the crotch the second time I wore them.  They look great and I got a lot of compliments on them. Unfortunately not very good quality. :(
2.0,To small in chest area. Made for girls in high school
2.0,"I am fully aware that this isn't intended to be a COVID mask. But most masks on the market aren't.  I have cloth masks, and gaiters for myself and you can't feel my breath come through the mask.  This one is as if he has a nylon on his face.  It doesn't hold back any breath at all.  Also it's very tight on my 8 year old. I was hoping that he'd find something that would be comfortable, but this is not it.  The ear holes aren't really necessary bc it's so tight on him, and when he does use the ear holes, it's just like how this style fits on an adult - where it goes so high that it almost covers the eyes if it isn't placed well.  it's too bad bc the concept is nice, and the patterns are fun."
2.0,Looks a little cheaper than I expected
2.0,They tarnished after one time of forgetting to take them out before getting in the shower. But otherwise really cute.
2.0,Seam of the shoulders was off shoulders by 3 inches front was benched would not recommend.
2.0,"Clasp and chain are poor quality,  pendant is very nice"
2.0,"Very nice pair of shoes, sadly one of the light sets died within 24 hours.  There's a tiny wire exposed that probably is the cause, doubt I can get my grandson to give them up for a return but will keep trying."
2.0,"Felt like I was on stilts. I believe a different style may have been pretty good, like the sandals did."
2.0,These earrings are very thin and falls off the easily.  Won't be wearing them often.  Disappointed
2.0,You can use about 2-3 times and then it will break.  Very thin and small.
2.0,Muy pequeños! Me parecen caros para su tamaño que es muy reducido
2.0,The fabric was very cheap
2.0,Was cheap quality made had to fix the straps of both of them the one I bought from the dollar store held together better
2.0,"I really wanted to love these, they were adorable. But thr size says 3C-7C and considering my kid is a 4-5C these should have worked. They shrank quite a bit after first wash and were very tight around the ankles (and my kid has small ankles). These are not true to size and shrink so much in the dryer after 1 wash."
2.0,My toes felt constricted but the fabric was ok. Compression is correct 15-20mmhg.
2.0,"I ordered this product a few weeks ago in an attempt to have it arrive before Thanksgiving. The product was listed with Prime shipping, so I had assumed I would be good on time. For some reason, even though I received &#34;free&#34; shipping for the product, it shipped directly from China and I received it yesterday.<br /><br />Regarding the shirt itself, it does not look anything like the photos. One of the main reasons that I chose this particular top was because of the pockets shown in the product image. The shirt I received did not have pockets. Additionally, I normally wear a L/XL and since the reviews said to size up, I ordered a XXL. When I tried the shirt on it was so small it fit like a US Women's size Small. It was too tight everywhere and even too narrow in the shoulders.<br /><br />If you are able to order quite a few sizes up from your normal size, you should be ok. Regardless, I wouldn't recommend this shirt to anyone."
2.0,"Poor quality, Chinese knockoff.. your money would be better spent somewhere else. Graphics are printed in a way that when you wear it no one can read it."
2.0,I love the fit and the design. The only thing is the material is peeling so now the top and bottom look sheer.🤦🏾‍♀️
2.0,had to repair pocket when I got it poor quality control If had not disposed of the package would have returned it
2.0,dont buy made very cheap and was way too small
2.0,"if I was anorexic, it would fit...at 5 feet and 7 inches, 135 lbs., it's too small"
2.0,"The main problem with the shirt is that the description on Amazon says it's a soft cotton blend of 60% cotton, 30% linen & 10% polyester.  In fact the label sewn into the shirt says it's 98% Ramie and 2% other.  Moreover the description says it's machine washable; the label sewn into the shirt says it must be hand washed or dry cleaned."
2.0,"Sadly it didn’t take long for parts on this necklace to begin breaking, and continue breaking in new ways while I attempted to fix it! I’m still keeping it anyway because I do find it very cute, despite lack of Hawkeye charm, and I figure I can jerryrig a more sustainable piece."
2.0,"This belt worked great for about 75 days, then it began to split apart. I am still able to wear it, but it is like wearing two belts layered on top of each other. Not happy with the quality."
2.0,I was not happy with its fit.
2.0,"I picked this one over other entries because the Q&A claimed the inside metal were stainless steel instead of brass. I could tell as soon as I put it in that it was brass because my ears became hot and enflamed right away. I even took them out and tried on stainless steel earrings I personally made to confirm it wasn't my ears being sensitive to having something in them.<br /><br />I don't have high expectations for quality for something priced in this range but at least be honest about the metal type. some buyers care because they have a metal allergy. added on one star for the style. if metal is not an issue, it's a cute style of earring. because it's brass based tho, expect it to patina."
2.0,Broke the first time they fell out of my pocket. I’m only 5’... so my pocket is only a 1’ drop lol
2.0,"I just received my beautiful watch today. I have been waiting a few months but it finally came in and is in great shape. It looks amazing on my little wrist. I have another one somewhat like it but it has a white band. I am so happy with my watch and still can't believe that I got it pretty cheap,  but you wouldn't think it was cheap when looking at it close. It is very elegant and I hope that it is good quality made. My other one has a spring that pops off quite a bit but this one seems better and hopefully is. This watch is worth every penny spent.<br /><br />Update<br /><br />Watch broke the second week that I wore it . Cheaply made and really disappointed.. the strap broke . It was a really cute watch but broke .<br /><br />I wouldn’t recommend it ."
2.0,"These ride down when you walk. And it’s not like they fit small on me. The fit is true to size and the fabric is nice, except they are really uncomfortable because I keep having to pull them up every two minutes. No, no, not for me, so I do not recommend."
2.0,Giant patch that’s ironed and stitched on. Not what was pictured. Pretty disappointed.
2.0,Definitely didn’t look like what I originally purchased
2.0,The band catches on fabrics and snags quite a bit.
2.0,This would’ve been great but I wish it was adjustable around the neck .
2.0,"Baggy, loose in places. Thats fine i5s the style i guess but the strings at every seam and losing both sleeve buttons after literally 1 wear is unacceptable for a 20 dollar shirt. If my job didnt require this color for uniforms i wouldve never kept it after the first day"
2.0,The material was good but it was too tight.
2.0,super uncomfortable not soft at all and very thin
2.0,Didn't fit like an XL
2.0,I love them so much they were super soft and fit right but they ripped in the butt after wearing three times.
2.0,Don't fit right.
2.0,"Item is good, but be ready to pay more for delivery at the postal service 😐🤔"
2.0,designs rub off after about a week of wear
2.0,I got this because i thought it would be easy to get on and off. It is very difficult and time consuming. Definitely not worth the trouble so we hardly use these shoes now.
2.0,"This item looks better on the listing. The wire is super cheap and can be stretched out straight without any force, like very thin aluminum wiring.  Disappointed in the overrall look and feel of this item,  and was purchased for a Christmas gift for my daughter. The item dropped 2 beads immediately after she opened the box,  and I was so embarrassed, and offered to returm it for another item,  but she refused saying she felt bad because I gave it to her, she would just keep it... but she hasn't worn it because it won't last through the day to wear.  It's now hanging on the mirror.<br />Beads look more like planets in person.  Not the look I was going for either.<br />2 stars for the colors of the beads."
2.0,"The shirt fits nicely...but its a kinda faded looking black, and the graphic is cracking before I have even worn it......will be returning, not sure if they are going to send a new one or if I just let it go completely."
2.0,"Very cute but too soft and easy to bend so be careful when you handle. Although i thought little too cheap quality, i'm keeping them because it looks really nice"
2.0,"Very thin silky material, more like costume material than an outfit. Too short."
2.0,"5’3”, 37-28-38 for reference. I bought the “small/medium” grey ombré leggings. The material is very nice, breathable and comfortable. Fits very nicely on my legs, but could use more give in the bum area. The waist band is SO high waisted. It comes up to my sports bra and I feel like I’m wearing a body suit. The waistband is seamless with no elastic band in it which is nice, however it’s too loose around my waist and I’m constantly pulling them up (around my waist, they don’t slide off my bum). I tried rolling them down and it just doesn’t feel comfortable for me. The length is nice if you’re short. It comes about 1/2-3/4” above my ankle. Taller people it may be too short."
2.0,A little disappointed that it’s not as slim as I would have liked.
2.0,"What I liked -The fabric is cute, but the print was larger then expected.<br />What I didn't like - The fabric was really thin, and the quality was not as expected. There is no seaming or hem so just a raw cut edge and with this type of fabric and the thinness, it is not going to stay up.<br />There was not enough for ""good"" for me to keep this so I returned it."
2.0,Nice product just runs very small
2.0,"It’s a crop top, the top was too tight and the shorts were too big!"
2.0,This was supposed to be cooling.  It was just as hot as any other mask .<br />Did not live up to hype.
2.0,i need to exchange it for a large but there is no return information on the package.
2.0,They look really nice but they're advertised as 16g and they're definitely bigger. Won't fit in my nose at all. I'm disappointed
2.0,the image on dress wasn't great quality and the skirt came unraveled quickly.
2.0,"I really liked the earrings on amazon, and when I opened them I was pleasantly surprised; however, one of the earrings was broken when I opened it :(. And my boyfriend and I are having trouble fixing it. Overall pretty disappointed."
2.0,Not really good quality
2.0,"The hello kitty eyeglass case seemed beautiful upon package opening. Once I opened the actual case, I found the liner wasn't properly glued. My daughter has already seen it so I'm not sending it back but for the price, I shouldn't have to fix the item before using it."
2.0,The size claimed is better than most.  The material weight is very thin lacking an outdoor ruggedness leading to questions of durability.  There is no crotch pocket for the men which puts pressure on stuff making the casual wearing of these uncomfortable.  The pants look good but lack a well thought out design for men and outdoor use.  I would not recommend these.
2.0,Sharks teeth are made of felt?!?!?!  Bent already as was vacuumed sealed. Does unfold nicely and is super soft. Can’t get over the felt bent teeth. Also has a snap on top for closure and pen marks near pockets. Returning. If I was more up for it I’d remove the teeth and use it but that defeats the purpose.
2.0,"The skirt looks good and I like the style.  However, it’s made from a very cheap jean material and runs slightly big."
2.0,It was a nice shirt but it kept riding up so it u do get this just put a tank top under a shirt
2.0,"This jacket is cute but very poorly made. Seams are ripping, thread is loose and I had to cut one of the snaps that hold the inner jacket in because it was sewn into the outter jacket. It's not very heavy or warm either."
2.0,"as others have described, it is unbearably small and made of poor materials."
2.0,I did not really care for this dress.  It did not look as nice on as it does in the photograph.
2.0,"There is no filter insert, just a plan piece of cloth. It's not reusable because the rhinestones fall off easily. Before use, I washed it gently with soap and water, let it air dry and they came off. Won't be able to use these."
2.0,didn't need another sweatshirt
2.0,"I found the posture t-shirt to be comfortable and to offer some encouragement to my back. The second day, I wore<br />it to a physical therapy appointment. The therapist who had told me to purchase it said that it was too loose in the back<br />and too tight in my bosom. I guess I can't fit into a regular size since I don't have a standard body shape. Wish there was some way to customize it because it is a good product."
2.0,"I'm 5'1, 125lbs, with a larger chest. I chose a medium and it fits nicely. It hugs my upper body without being revealing or too snug. The length is perfect.<br /><br />Edited to add: the top feels a little big and it seems see through. I'm not happy with that. Reduced from 4 stars to 2 just due to the sheer fabric at the top. I don't like that it is so see through that I can't even wear a nude coloured bra."
2.0,Street clothes.
2.0,They fit me but so Snugly that I look even skinnier than I already am. Those who would like to have such problems would change their minds on hearing &#34;oh you really have lost weight! You're too skinny! Stop!&#34; I'm trying already. But the size and fit makes them warm leggings. The material and fit makes them itchy. Too much spandex (over 5%) and my skin itches. Returning them is more h hassle than its worth.
2.0,These shorts are SO wide in the legs. They would be freaking cute if they fit right. Definitely not for petite/smaller framed bodies. I ordered a small. I’m 5’1” and 100 pounds. They were huge in the legs/hips
2.0,"I wanted a loose fit top and this was not. I’m 5’1 about 145lbs. Ordered my normal size, medium and it just didn’t work out."
2.0,Would work for a child but not an adult . Bought to carry at an amusement park and it was not enough space for me
2.0,"The set itself fits well, is true to size and really cute. However, the white set is sooooo see through. I definitely wouldn’t wear this out."
2.0,"Overall quality is poor. The green is not as 'washed out' looking as the photo. Nearly see through material. Unfortunately, will be returning."
2.0,Watch face very large.
2.0,It is too clingy to be an A line dress. It also runs small. Fabric feels like plastic. It doesn't breath. Really disappointed.
2.0,"It's absolutely hideous and nothing like the picture. The only reason I gave it two stars is because it's insanely comfortable. I wouldn't be caught dead in public wearing it, but it's a comfortable nightgown."
2.0,"This fit like an XL size. Unacceptable, disappointing."
2.0,"These gloves were terribly constructed.  I am 6' 4"" tall with long slender fingers.  I purchased a set of extra large.  The length was okay, but the problem is that the finger tips were poorly shaped, making the tips more like claws than fingers.  Also, the thumb was about an inch too long (you can see in the picture).  I don't know if the construction quality has declined since the pandemic, or if I got a bad set, but the pair I received were terrible.  Also, they didn't work well at all on my phone.  I tried to use them indoors where it wasn't cold, and they worked about 20%.  Overall, these were a bust.  hope this helps."
2.0,"Very small. My husband couldn't even get his foot in. He's a size 9, I got the large 10..."
2.0,"Cute, but way too big.. might just be my belly button, but they were too long and the jewelry too large."
2.0,"The jacket lets water in, so my daughter came home soaked down the front of her shirt. I do not recommend this jacket if you want to stay dry. If you are just after fashion, then you may be okay with it."
2.0,The posted size was two sizes bigger.
2.0,Was supportive
2.0,"it is stamped stainless steel,but when it got scratched it showed copper underneath, very disappointed"
2.0,The outfit looked exactly like the picture.. I ordered a 2x however it was still too small in pants..
2.0,"the clear ones are fine, the black ones too fragile & soon break"
2.0,"Very nice design, but quality seems kinda cheap. The part of the earring that goes through the piercing was bent on one of the earrings. maybe I just had a defective one or its just cheap."
2.0,"I was so excited for this dress--I couldn't wait to wear it on vacation. It's a beautiful fit, and in every other way is a perfect summer dress. But after wearing it the first time, I noticed a large tear in the upper par of the sleeve along the seam. It wasn't tight at all, and I don't think it caught on anything. But the fact that the rip was along the sleeve makes me think that there was an issue with the stitching of the dress; maybe it was loose. And it might be that it was just on my dress, but it could also be a manufacturing issue."
2.0,They're really shiny polyester. Then I washed them they shrunk. Don't buy these.
2.0,"The length is great, but the arms are way too tight."
2.0,Good quality. Doesn't fit as advertised. Runs small
2.0,This was way too big the belt itself didn’t seem to bad
2.0,super uncomfortable and ill-fitting. they were falling so bad while walking that the entire grocery store nearly saw my butt. the material is super itchy as well send leaves a crazy imprint with the pattern. it is flattering for pictures of your behind though. would not recommend for anything else.
2.0,This product is very comfortable but the product is also very see through so if you have anything like a tattoo or anything dark you will be able to see it quite clearly.
2.0,"Not at all what I expected. The front of the cap is very flimsy, the front folds and cresses when you put it on. The bill does not keep its shape."
2.0,Bought based on size chart to fit my eight year old who’s small for her age. Might have fit her when she was six? 🙃
2.0,"These are good quality belt rank key chains, but not as pictured. The majority have a stripe through them. Not solid colors as shown."
2.0,Light would not light enough to see numbers at night
2.0,I didn’t receive the same ring that in the picture the shape of the outside is different
2.0,"This is going back. The sweater was WAY too big for my size adult small 14 year old in the shoulders, but tighter in the arms, so a smaller size wouldn't have worked. The shoulders were droopy and shapeless and the fabric is really thin. Just not what we were hoping for at all."
2.0,"Cute and warm, but way too big."
2.0,That's too bad. The necklace isn't centered right and the stones fall right out. Not worth the money. Although the color is beautiful in person.
2.0,These are alright for the price I guess. I bought 2 as a gift and returned them because I wanted higher quality.
2.0,Very cute & comfortable shirt but it Runs two Sizes Too Small!!! Your Size Chart is Not Accurate. You need to change it to reflect the true size. Also fits snug. But still really cute.
2.0,This was more like a light weight wind breaker.  I was looking for something that was a regular rain coat.
2.0,"The watch itself functions perfectly fine. It has an alarm, shows the days of the week, and has a light, but the light is not very powerful. Overall, it's a decent watch. (I would give it 4-5 stars if it was just fine and this was it.)<br /><br />My issue with the watch is that it gave me an allergic reaction on my wrist exactly where the plastic was in contact with my skin. I think there is a toxic chemical in the plastic that I'm having a reaction to, and it's taken at least two days for my skin to actually heal.<br /><br />If you look at the photo very closely, you'll see that the skin area looks like it has a lot of tiny bumps on it. (This is AFTER several days of not wearing it and letting my skin heal.) When I wear it, my skin turns red, gets a lot of bumps, and it itches.<br /><br />It makes me sad to write this review because I was really looking forward to wearing this watch and enjoying it for a long time. I won't be able to unfortunately. :( I'll be looking to return it and report the issues."
2.0,"Comfortable, easy to install. A bit tough to get over wrist once clasped. Also, fitting at point it attaches to watch body has become “loose”. Will have to observe to ensure it doesn’t fall off!"
2.0,The broke after falling off my hat
2.0,The insert arms already broke off and numerous times to retrieve them flying off.. Not worth the even $20. You will lose in a day.
2.0,straps do not look like picture
2.0,"I am 5'7 and wear size 14-16 of clothing. I don't consider myself short, but this dress in size XL was touching the ground. I don't like long dresses touching the ground. (It's gross) Wish I could return it."
2.0,Had to send this little watch back. The operative word being 'little'. Face on this watch was so small I could barely read it without putting on my reading glasses! It just didn't seem to me to be a good buy!
2.0,"The skull and spine pattern is printed on both sides, which I don't like, and didn't expect.<br /><br />The material is a bit thin, slippery and does not stay in place well... inferior to other tuffs I own.<br /><br />The skull and spine are much paler that they appear on the photo.<br /><br />Too bad, I like the design."
2.0,No me funciono a mi reloj
2.0,Way smaller than it should be
2.0,One pair ripped after the first time wearing them ....
2.0,"I was very disappointed because it is very light weight. I was expecting one like the Rabbi used at the synagogue. Wish I could exchange it for a heavier weight.,"
2.0,"$12 isn't a tall asking price for a mask like this, so my hopes weren't overly high. And I definitely don't hate the look of what I received. But it's not the same as what's being advertised. And the latex scent bleeds too heavily onto everything it touches (and smells up whatever room it's in).<br /><br />The problem with what you get vs what you see in the product photos is twofold: The coloration is far less richly detailed (think a printer running out of ink), and there are small holes above the eyes (for looking out of). The holes are actually shown once in the ""LATEX PROP"" photo, so it's not a complete wash of false advertising. But they are oddly placed, and as difficult to see out of as the nose holes are to breathe out of (there's no mouth hole here). Additionally, the mask fits more snugly than I'd have thought, because it looks quite large.<br /><br />Without seeing the product photos compared to what I received, and knowing the latex scent will eventually fade, I'd have initially given this 3 stars. To be frank: while I'm not in love with it, the thing does look quite good when worn. And it's priced fairly. But if you're expecting this to mirror what's shown in the photos, or to wear it right away, be prepared for disappointment."
2.0,"Runs a little small, not as soft as expected, color of shirt didn't match the color of the waist band, cuffs or neck..shade lighter maybe... Not for me.."
2.0,"I wear a size 8, so I ordered the size 8-9. These slippers are like boats on my little feet!!! They feel fuzzy on the inside but the sole is firm. I'll be donating these!"
2.0,"I feel like an issue I'm having with this style of dress lately is that the elastic waist is set right under the bust and not at the waist. This would make a great maternity dress, but does not show off my shape!"
2.0,Didn't like. A lot going on in terms of shape and thickness even for a big and tall as that's what's advertised. Felt amiss.
2.0,The earrings look like cut glass. Cheap looking.  I do not recommend them. They don't look as good in person as they do on the Amazon pics.
2.0,Some what short
2.0,The suit is super cute but it made my daughter break out in hives both times we tried it on her<br />Shes not normally allergic to anything so please be careful putting these on your little ones
2.0,Just ok. It's sheer and somewhat large. A little cheap looking but you get what you pay for. I still haven't worn it out yet and I've had it a few months. Just too wide. Looks sloppy
2.0,I’ll need to exchange for larger size. At time of ordering no dimensions listed for each size
2.0,"This rash guard looks nice, but is far too thin for grappling and is very tight and non-flattering. I own 2 other rash guards and the material is way thicker, 1 of which was cheaper. Not bad for sun protection, but I would not recommend for grappling."
2.0,The earings are too big!
2.0,Could barely keep the sun out of my eyes<br />The sides help nothing.
2.0,Quality is good like the feel of the material ... but massive!<br />I’m 5”2 weight is 140 Jean size is 8 bra size is 34DDD. I ordered a small. I was going to order a medium because that’s what I usually wear but decided to go with a small because I’m short. I expected it to be a little tight in top area because most tops are .. well It’s not even a little tight. Super sad because it’s cute! Hey
2.0,lots of bling and dangly disappointed thought the pearl didn't work for me  and it never showed the pearls in the picture.Hmmm might return
2.0,Good product but not true to size. Run big.
2.0,"The styling on this is fantastic!<br /><br />My issue was with the fabric. I expected a tshirt material of a reasonable weight since it says &#34;perfect for a cold day.&#34; It's not. It's like the texture of nylon and really lightweight. While I'm ok with lightweight, I'm not ok with the strange silky fabric. It doesn't really feel like cotton. The nonexistent tag made it impossible to tell what it is. The one tag I could find on the side said it recommended drycleaning or to wash it separately.<br /><br />It really just wasn't like anything I was anticipating. Bummer! Because the style and fit are great!"
2.0,This was far to small. I can't see how this is a one size fits all product.
2.0,The blouse is not that well made and \I ordered s and it looks like XL
2.0,The product was too small and ripped very easily
2.0,"This dress I purchased based on the reviews, I ordered a size larger. It was too large and the neck is too big and low.<br />The dress needs a liner and the button holes are too big, it is not worth the price. The product quality is not up to American standard."
2.0,"Very thin material, fits everywhere but around arms.  This shirt took over 2 months to arrive.  Would return, but figure it is just too much trouble.  Will not purchase from this seller again.  Loved the style, just bad material and fit was very odd."
2.0,"Very thin material , look better than what I received , i would not order again."
2.0,I didn't care for these.  The material was too thin and the waistband was too thin and small.
2.0,"These are very cheaply made gloves.  They are not going to stand up to much wear at all.  These might be good for walking around, but that’s about it.  Neck muff is nice though.  These are going back."
2.0,It fit perfect and it's a cute summer dress but I had to return it because it was very see through
2.0,Headband came broken with one ear not glued..right out of the package
2.0,THESE WERE TOO SMALL. I USE THEM FOR MY LAUNDRY
2.0,"If you are tall and thin, this dress is perfect for you. I have curves (36B, 30 in waist, 36 in hips, 5'4"") and this dress didn't look at all like the photos. The lace on the back is very loose, no matter how many times we tied and re-tied it"
2.0,It's not even close to real leather. The real colour doesn`t match the picture.
2.0,Not bad But scratchy
2.0,cheap looking  unimpressed gave it away
2.0,"I expected this material to be cotton since that's the way it looks in the pictures. However, the details does say polyester so I can only fault myself in that mix up. It fits ok.. rises in the crotch section but thats to be expected.. just wish it was cotton instead."
2.0,"Not a big fan of it , the pants are weird and look odd in the front . Just overall the whole outfit is poor design"
2.0,This was great until the log started to come off. My husband has worn this for a month and it’s already coming off. Not acceptable for the price point. You can get a regular black silicone ring for $10 or less. Disappointed
2.0,Got this ring a few days ago. It looks as if it's not fully glued. Colors are fading. Not worth the money or the wait.
2.0,Looks and fits great. Don't expect to open more than one-two bottles. Was a fun gag while it lasted.
2.0,I found it a little shorter on me than I had hoped it would fit.
2.0,Had to return. One size does not fit all. The arms were way too tight.
2.0,Metal pin to keep band on the watch is weak. I've gone threw two of the these bands. I will not order again. 2 star because it looks good
2.0,"May seem like common sense, but these bracelets CANNOT be worn in the shower several times consecutively. The pieces just come apart. You get what you pay for...cheap leather bracelets."
2.0,"I'm 5'4'' just over 130, I ordered a small, even with adjusting, the top still goes down to my mid rib. The shorts, they come up past my natural waist, and both bands fold in in themselves with the slightest movement."
2.0,"Okay for the price but pretty cheaply made, the fabric is nice but the eyelets look like someone just used a hole punch, looks unfinished. Being that im 9 months pregnant i stize up from a medium to a large...even at 9 months pregnant this dress was too big. Stick to your size, maybe even size down. Im 5 feet 2in 186 lbs pregnant. I thought id need a large to make room for my chest..the chest was the largest part on me. Not pregnant me wouldnhave chosen a medium at weight of 155 and Im assuming that would have been too big. Anyway im returning this and not replacing it with a smaller size because of cheap look to it"
2.0,Hurt feet no bueno
2.0,"I was hopeful about this item but sadly, they arrived damaged and scratched all over. I returned them right away. They’re not cheap for knockoff sunglasses."
2.0,"Material is extremely thin. This would be a super cute bathing suit for a baby girl still wearing a diaper, but not for girls that don’t wear anything underneath."
2.0,It did not fit me but it is still pretty good quality
2.0,The color of the dress was more of a light pink than a biege. So I ordered a new dress in adifferent color.
2.0,"I was not expecting to have to assemble it myself or that it was made of particle board. This was meant to be a nice gift and the quality was not what I was hoping for. The holes that were drilled for the magnet were spaced too far apart and the screws pulled right out of the particle board. One of the clasps on the wire door was missing, there were slight scratches on the finish and the wood caps all went in the holes at different depths. It is still cute when all is said and done, but for the price it should be better quality. I doubt it will last too long."
2.0,Only lasted 8 months.. no other wear just a straight line up the lower ab.. glad I got out of the pool at home and alone..<br />cute just not a long term item.
2.0,These fit nothing like the Amanda jeans. They are skin tight and fit like leggings from the waist to the knee.
2.0,"Weird material and just doesn't hang right. I ordered a medium, I'm usually between a medium and large depending on the fit. This thing was just huge on me."
2.0,"Clearly not a small/medium fit but only a small. Bought same brand a few months before that fit perfectly. These crowd my toes uncomfortably together. Measured against the ones that fit, they are a minimum of an inch shorter. Plus, I noticed an ""S"" sewn into tops of these socks, clearly depicting them as only a small. Returned & won't be fooled again. Have another brand on order; will see how they are."
2.0,"The loop on top was broken completely off of one when I got them. I do not have time to go through with a return, so I am just left with less supplies than needed and paid for. This also scares me because if one broke so easily during shipping, then it could happen to my customers with a finished jewelry product."
2.0,"I am5ft 135lbs 34DD. I just need much more support than this suit is able to offer. I looked do awful in this. It's super hard to find a size small that can accommodate 34dd, even a medium is made for small, happy boobs. I like the companies who make a size small with large cups; that's my dream!"
2.0,"The slaves are too large. I'll it could be a bit reduiced. In additions, the fabric used is not good quality as it looks like online. It can lasts on the time"
2.0,Doesn't look at all like the picture and it very cheaply made. You can read a book through the fabric it's so thin. I got a large even though I'm typically a medium and it was still too small. It took a month to get here so I don't want to waste the time of sending it back. Very disappointed.
2.0,Disappointed in this purchase. Not large enough to wrap around twice. Not what was pictured. And the chemical smell is horrible.
2.0,"These are pretty comfortable but after about 1 week of wearing them,  I noticed that the sole has a tear in it."
2.0,Really disappointed. I like the color and fabric but ordered myself a large (which is my typical size) and I can just barely zip it and it's too tight around the arms and shoulders. I used a coupon code to get a discount when buying this item so now I can't return it even though I would still like to have the jacket and the XL is still the same price as the L
2.0,"Way too short, and I am only 5'2&#34;! It might have been better if I tried a medium, but I could not go out in the small."
2.0,There's no buttons on the pants or stretch to them.
2.0,"The shorts are fine quality, but they run REALLY big, I usually wear a medium, bought a small, and they are still a little too big. But they have 2 pockets, and do a decent job staying in place, definitely not compression shorts though, unless you usually wear a large and buy a small.. wish they had extra small because I like them otherwise. I was able to run 1.5 miles on the treadmill with my phone in the pocket, and they didn't fall off, but i had to pull them up very high, and roll down the top."
2.0,Sent a 4 when listed as a youth small. Cute shirt though. Much brighter colors than I expected.
2.0,Shipping was fast. The watch is not the best quality. But what do you expect for 15 dollars. This watch does not hold a charge unless you shake it vigorously. Would not purchase this again.
2.0,"BMW Venture Grip Boots:  beautiful design and color, high quality leather, confortable...but has two deffects:  1.- They do not have a patch to protect the leather when shifting gears.  2.- They are absolutely NOT waterproof as announced.  The BMW Motorrad dealer in Canada accepted to exchange the first pair of boots because they got soaked after a few rides under the rain...This second pair got soaked after the first downpour.<br />Of course, I can ask again the dealer to apply the warranty and I am sure they will exchange the boots, but I am not sure this will solve the issue if the boots are really NOT waterproof.<br />I am disappointed!!!"
2.0,I'm not sure if it will fit my 10 year old daughter
2.0,Very stiff and sits high on the head.
2.0,Corre angosto
2.0,The earrings are cute but came bent in the mail. They should have been in a box the post was bent as was the earring itself.
2.0,"Very cute. However, I received 2 different patterns in one pack.  One with much larger holes than the other."
2.0,They're very pretty how ever they arrived broken
2.0,I thought from viewing the watch on line that the band was an expandable band. It was not. It was  a non expandable band with a folding clasp
2.0,I got a size up and they still were too small. They killed my feet. Glad they were only used on St Patrick's day where all the alcohol helped with the pain.
2.0,I’m 5’1 and this dress was about as long as the girl wearing it in the picture. Usually when I go by pictures it is much longer - not so in this case. Ordered XL and this XL girl has no business wearing something this shirt :)
2.0,"Not well painted, there is excess blue on the A, and is slightly bent towards the bottom."
2.0,I liked the shape and color of the dress but the material was low quality so I decided to return it.
2.0,kind heavy and hurt my ears
2.0,I like the product but they did not pass the see-through test.
2.0,Cute shirts and are fine quality but they fit way too small. I ordered 5T and they fit more like a 3T.
2.0,Short and cheap
2.0,Shorts fit fine but the top is really tight in the stomach area and the breast area is a bit uncomfortable. Cute and breathes well just not true to size or fit
2.0,"they are ok, could of used moreof a backing to it."
2.0,Ordered 5 pairs for bridesmaids to wear. They are cheap and 2 of the 10 earrings were broken (clasps wouldn't work) out of the box. Thankfully i only needed 4. They are poor quality
2.0,"I wear a size small, sometimes x-small, in the US. I bought a size small for this rain jacket since it was the smallest size available for green. It is noticeably oversized on me surprisingly since many reviewers insist to size up because the manufacturer's (made in China) sizes run small.<br />Also, the fit and silhouette look ridiculous. The sleeves are way too long and wide even for a larger set woman, they resemble kimono sleeves, which do not reflect the picture shown. Another flaw is, there are no belt loops on the waist or the cuff!!! How are the straps suppose to stay on?<br />The only positive thing is the jacket is lightweight and packable.<br />Please save your money and don't buy this product."
2.0,The actual product was much smaller than the photo. It looked as if it is sized for a child
2.0,It fit nicely when it arrived but after 1 wash it started to fall apart. Worn it twice and it already has holes in the sleeves.
2.0,Cute but I ordered up a couple of sizes and they were still too snug around the middle and pockets are placed in a position that is very unflattering.
2.0,Run small..everything else is good tho
2.0,It was ok. It Scurt is small
2.0,"This dress does fit true to size, and isn't too long (I'm 5'2"" so maxi dresses can be tricky for me). The color is on-trend and pretty, and I like the material of the skirt a lot - it looks nice and more expensive than it is.<br /><br />The top, however, looks terrible. The ruching is puckered up in random places all over the top, and it didn't smooth out after washing and hanging it to dry. I'm sorry I'm unable to post a picture, but it's just not a good look, seems like a manufacturer error. I like the skirt so much though, I'm going to try to cut off the top part and just wear the skirt."
2.0,Size ordered in correct in expectation
2.0,cat heads came off
2.0,Bought these for my son as a stocking stuffer at Christmas. He wore them for about a month and they both broke. I expected them to last longer.
2.0,Does little for toe warmth<br />It fits over the shoe fine
2.0,"The zipper came broke, I had my sister help see how tight it would be if the zipper was not broken and it fits pretty tight. I am 5'4 and about 218lbs, have D cup chest and my body has curves like coke bottle. Lol it was very tight at the bust but it did flow nicely from my stomach so would have been flattering.<br /><br />If you qear size 18, you might be able to fit the largest size depending on your body type.<br /><br />I was disappointed that it came 💔"
2.0,I loved these bras they are so comfortable....until you wash them. First wash in the washing machine and the bra was ruined. Would not reccomend.
2.0,"The outside the look is amazing, it looks super cute but the space is too small, it is more for a reading type of glasses because I try to put a regular por of sunglasses and the zipper won’t go all they way to close it, so it stays open :( Probably will return it because most of my sunglasses are square or big so won’t fit."
2.0,it must run small.
2.0,"Expensive underwear that rolls up to a ~1/4"" elastic waistband to hide - worthless otherwise. Waistband rolls down - BADLY. Not like I have a huge belly either. Big waste. My Spanx Tshirt compresses better.<br />Me thinks people who review these stomach extended shaping underwear have not tried other - FAR better - shaping products. Try something else. You'll be FAR happier."
2.0,Maybe hand wash only and it will last longer
2.0,Turned green after a couple of weeks
2.0,The quality was cheap and you could see-through the dress.  But I was not surprised of the quality got the price.  Returned the dress.
2.0,The fit was awkward and the material was too see-through being white to wear without a slip.
2.0,"The dress doesn't fit like it should.  The elastic is sown poorly, it looks more like a moo moo."
2.0,They worked well for about a month then the adjustment clamp broke. They're convenient but for the price I'd expect better quality.
2.0,"This coat looks good, but the size is weird - coat long below the knee but sleeves 3/4, just a little below the elbow.<br />I would not recommend that coat."
2.0,"This pant must have been sitting in Amazon warehouse for too long because as soon as wore them, it ripped. Waste of money"
2.0,"It’s too big. No nose clip. Single, no protection. Have to wear a disposable under it."
2.0,It did not fit all the way on my head like a carhartt hat does. That is the look/feel I was trying for here. The EGA came off after a wash. I just threw it away.
2.0,"I love and hate this dress at the same time. The top is comfy and material is of good quality. Now the bottom........is an entirely different material with no stretch, its a flat cotton that has a zipper down the side of the dress. Because the two materials collide, I fought with the zipper to get it to transition to the bottom material. I would only recommend this for a very thin frame or someone who has little or no curves. Like literally no curves."
2.0,Too small and this look cheap. Not wat I was expecting
2.0,Arms were short!
2.0,My wife did not like the print
2.0,"The pink sunglasses are great. It fit really well and I love the color.<br />The silver one, on the other hand, was clearly used. There were fingerprints and were much more loose. It won’t sit on my face, Constantly sliding off. Now I don’t mind buying used items, ( I love thrift stores) But don’t sell as NEW."
2.0,"[[VIDEOID:8271a1dd1c5e6d5ddb78f27249e0db7c]] When I bought the necklace I thought I would really like it. The Amazon Reviews are 5 stars and the product description looked great. Sadly though, I couldn’t justify giving the product 5 stars.<br /><br />Some key points though:<br />1) Nice cushioned box<br />2) Packaged very well<br />3) Small pendant<br />4) My chain arrived flawed<br />5) I found the blue color wasn’t truly described. The website had a picture of an almost Sapphire blue, but the stone looked nearly black against my skin.<br /><br />The discrepancies in color coupled with the small size and flawed chain didn’t allow me to be blown away by this product."
2.0,Good strap<br />Only one problem the red dye<br />Rubs off.....onto your clothing
2.0,After reading the other reviews I realized that this would be more of a peacock color than true black but I was fine with that since I was trying to match other peacock pearls. However this didn't even have a variety of colors in it. The pearls are all quite uniformly grey so this piece doesn't match the set I was adding it to at all and it looks pretty bland.
2.0,Love hate with this sandal. Were hard at first until you break them in like a few days. Have had about a month and the strap came out of the sandal. Disappointed. Want another pair but to scared will happen again.
2.0,"It's a cute earring but everything in the add says post length is 6mm, the one they sent me is 8mm. Too long doesn't work for my peircing."
2.0,I bought these for my nephews in a size 7 and size 4. They are Kinda junky. One shirt came with a small stain and the other shirt was not pressed correctly. Had higher Hope's.  Guess they are PJs now. :(
2.0,Did not like material it was also to small
2.0,"The photo is a little deceiving. It really doesn't flare at the bottom as indicated in the photo, so it is a little clingier than I expected.  Also, I wear a size  medium, but took into account that it's made in China and knew it would be skimpy so I ordered an XL. The  boy shorts in the back barely cover my butt."
2.0,I normally order medium with no issues. This is huge
2.0,"This dress arrived and I was at first very excited, as the chiffon looked very romantic and it fit as expected, except for the liner, which was EXTREMELY short. This skirt would require just constant fiddling with to cover my ladybits! I suppose that could be because I am very tall, so tall ladies beware. It also was very see-through. I had hoped to wear this as a rehearsal dinner dress, but I ended up making a few alterations and turning it into lingerie!"
2.0,Significantly smaller than normal sizing.
2.0,They are shiny and very see through. And they fall down my tush so I have to constantly pull up on them.
2.0,the black paint on the ring wears off really fast & makes your finger green
2.0,"Comfortable, opaque, and well-fitting but pilled after about 3 wears.  I bought two pairs because I had a former version of this french terry model which I loved.  Wish I could return them... but it's too late."
2.0,"No puede oler el agua, si solo le cae unas gotas mientras te lavas las manos, enseguida se humedece por dentro"
2.0,"Ordered the black, white and tan one, but got this black and white one instead. I'm not happy. It's also really short and a little too small. I ordered an XL, I'm 5'9 and 218lbs. My chest measurement is a 45. If you're similar to my size, order a size bigger. Xl fits, but I can't button it, which is fine for me."
2.0,way too tight to wear for an xl
2.0,Ordered one of these and loved it so I ordered another one. Second one came flat and not put together and the gem had fallen out.
2.0,This coat is sized completely wrong. Order 3 sizes larger than you are.
2.0,This is cute for dress up but not for actual dance class. The cotton is thin and the tutu is not even close to the fullness pictured. We were disappointed.
2.0,I was disappointed; it was easy to big!
2.0,It is a nice outfit but not for women that are short.
2.0,I ordered these for my six and nine year old daughters. Nearly impossible to get them over their heads to wear as masks. They are now hair scrunchies.
2.0,"The dress had a tiny stain on it, not too noticeable, but still...It also had about five small holes in the lacy part. I’m probably not going to return it because I’m using it for a “rugged” maternity photoshoot from a distance in the woods/water anyways. You get what you pay for."
2.0,The zip was broken 2 months after I purchased it.
2.0,"It's beautiful, really is. But that chest size and even dress overall is a smaller fitting."
2.0,"I have a couple Yvette bras that I love. When I saw these, I had to try. Ordered a size up from the ones I had since these were a front closure, and based on a few other reviews I read. The zipper was nowhere near being close enough together to zip- I still had a 2+ inch gap atleast. I was so disappointed because otherwise, I loved the way these were made- they looked and felt durable, the material felt nice and was not itchy and had the right amount of thickness to it.<br /><br />Be careful with your sizing and adjust because it may be too small if you are bigger chested like I am."
2.0,I like this pair of glasses for blocking the blue light. The frames were a little larger than I thought - I don't consider my face too petite but these look big on me. They feel chinsy and flimsy - and smudge easily.
2.0,small in the chest mainly
2.0,"Very pretty,  very thin. Has completely bent out of shape"
2.0,Too small very little stretch
2.0,Not true to size at all. Need to order  2 times bigger than your size.
2.0,"unfortunately these did not fit, way too small lenght was though.  i even ordered up."
2.0,One of the nose pads came off rather quickly with minimal wear-time.
2.0,"I can make the cheap see through material work. I cannot, however, make the extremely poor sewing and design of the neckline work. It essentially looked like someone cut out two triangles and sewed them on top. I would not recommend this dress."
2.0,"I really don't like the material on these. They seem like regular cotton leggings, not that smooth material that wicks moisture from your body. They are going to show every drop of sweat. I ordered a small. The waist is way too big around but the hips are tight. And the length of the waist, they go all the way up past my ribs. I won't return them, but I won't buy another pair."
2.0,Beautiful to look at but soo uncomfortable to wear. I have a small wrist and this bracelet was rough and ate into my wrist. Such promise and such disappointment.
2.0,I noticed the stitching in these leggings starting to come apart the first day I was wearing them. It’s gotten worse ever since. Super sad because they are comfortable
2.0,I am larger on top so the fabric is stretched thin. Must wear a slip! I am a modest dresser so this is too thin of fabric and if it is stretched anywhere on the body it is very shear. Size up if you think you may be between sizes.
2.0,I ordered the black floral print and ended up returning it.  The fabric was okay but there was a large hole in the arm along the seam due to missed stitching and the pattern looked very different from what was pictured.  Also the style of the dress is very boxy which for me is unflattering.
2.0,"The rings were too big for my taste so I returned it. Because they were so big, they were heavy on my neck. I would have liked the rings to be smaller. If they were I would have kept the choker because I did like the design."
2.0,It was too small. The elastic wouldn't stretch enough to be pulled up. I returned it.
2.0,"Color is not accurate. I ordered red, but when it arrived, it's a bright orange. It's also a stiff material I think would be itchy after a while."
2.0,Product band fell apart right after I bought it.. while wearing and broke my watch when it fell off  🙁😔😓
2.0,"This shirt is pretty odd, it is basically a short sleeve shirt that has long sleeves sewn on mid bicep. Not very comfortable, but it’s fine to wear around the house."
2.0,This dress was a bit too big for me.. it looked like I stole my aunts church dress.. not cute enough for the party I was attending.. a no for me..
2.0,"Seems like they didn't expect anyone to use it as a belt.<br /><br />A couple of design problems:<br />1.  The door that holds the 'survival' gear opens upwards, this puts the sharp edges of the hinge towards your skin above your jeans and means that you must remove the belt to access the chamber.<br />2.  The rounded end of the belt is not woven flat, it's extremely difficult to get through the two slots to lock on the belt.  (As a minor fix you can reverse that part and use the metal tag as the loose end of the belt)<br />3.  The metal tag has sharp edges at the top and bottom, these can easily cut you.<br />4.  The belt slips since the locking mechanism is just friction on completely smooth plastic."
2.0,"These are cute and made a great gift for Christmas, but after just 1 wash I noticed some of the sparkly accents had started peeling or had washed off and were sticking to other clothing items in the wash. After two washes it is evident that these are not going to be good for more than a few wear/washes. Disappointed because my daughter loves them and they aren’t as easy to find anymore."
2.0,This product was very big on me. The material was thin and wrinkled easily. It is not as structure as the photo. Sadly will be returning.
2.0,It is not a 2.5 fit-  see photo the cleats on either end are size 2’s .. the nike in middle is a size 2.5.  Disappointed. My kid is a 2 and these dont fit him. And i dont think they are exvhangeable
2.0,I missed the part where it says these shoes are glittery. My son doesn’t seem to care because he loves the color green more then anything. They fit him well and being 2 he’s able to put them on himself so that’s a plus.
2.0,People keep wondering what’s on my face instead of ignoring it. You’re better off wearing the metal one and people just accept it because this looks like you have bar salt on your lip...
2.0,"Beautiful, comfortable watch. BUT: second broke broke off within a few months, and then whole thing stopped working very soon after. Not recommended."
2.0,I have to say....a little dissapointed with this outfit.  Jacket wasn't finished well and the pants are very small and tight.
2.0,After 3 days my watch clasp was scratched up. The band itself doesn't hold up well and has a few Knicks in it. The black band attracts lint and looks dusty and faded. Definitely not worth the price. However I have a very small wrist and was able to adjust this to fit.
2.0,"The earrings are a nice size, however, they do not have a back. I thought they were lever backs, they just hook. I will be returning them."
2.0,Very cheap it broke before I could even wear it. I was not satisfied with this purchase at all. I guess you get what you pay for.
2.0,"im very dissapointed, they are not that big and pretty, how they present it, is like more for babies earrings, is to small for men, i bought this earrings for my husban and i ended it with them"
2.0,The screw threads on this item have been poorly cleaned. Adjusting the device with your hands is difficult - you have to used wrenches
2.0,The feathers bled when I washed it for the first time! Such a shame because it's so cute on!
2.0,It was big and bulky.... not something I could wear longer than a few hrs.  If it was reduced in size I would give it 4/5 stars.  But it’s sweet gift t myself  and brought back memories of my childhood.
2.0,Peplum fits a little too short. Fabric would be better with a little more weight.
2.0,"This is a stamped silver locket - rather than engraved, and makes a thin irritating hollow sound every time it moves. I would've gladly paid a higher price for a smaller solid silver piece - one that would be comfortable to wear often - this is not it. This locket is not worth the advertised price and silver content is not accurate - actually 4 grams - not 5.78. I'm returning for a refund & will buy one from a jewelry store where I can actually see what I'm buying, instead of online and have to return the item for a refund. Disappointed in this purchase."
2.0,Too small and ugly for 10 dollars
2.0,"These are thin, soft and seem like jersey leggings instead of fleece.  The Nike iron-on logo looks like a cheap knock-off and will come off after a few washes.  Selling much more here and come with the price tag of $45. If you can, just order directly from the Nike store."
2.0,The handle of the bag broke the day my daughter got it.
2.0,Meh. 36DD wont cover the boobs but too big everywhere else. It's my curse.
2.0,"I could not get the attached metal buckle to close, even when I placed it on a firm surface and put my entire upper-body strength into the effort. I had to use a big screwdriver as a pry bar to release the attachment closure part of the buckle so I could try putting the included plastic buckle on. That worked, just. The metal buckle as designed can't be used with this thickness of webbibg. Perhaps it would work with a thin soft cotton webbing belt."
2.0,Very thin & see through material. The chest area is a very odd fit. Tank or undershirt is a must. The chest hangs open & is very unflattering.
2.0,at least 2 sizes too small.  I gave it to my 12 year old daughter instead and she loves it.  Not made very well.I would not buy from this company again.  Better to go to a local boutique and see first what you are getting.
2.0,"The shirt was pretty but it’s very short, and too small, I normally wear a medium, so I ordered a medium, way too tight, and very short"
2.0,"First of all, I have 5 solid colors of these tanks and they are amazing! Uploaded pic with the white tank because it shows more true fit vs. the darker colors that tend hide the curves (and I have a black bra on under the white tank - material is perfect - not too thin!)I would give the solid tanks a 5 star all day long. BUT for the printed tanks, I have to give a 2-3 star rating. Here's why: I went to order more tanks because the first 2 were so amazing (fit perfect, soft, stretchy - my favorite tanks in my closet), and I noticed they now had this leopard print one! Fell in love, especially knowing the others fit perfect. Got the leopard print one in today and am so disappointed. The size runs MUCH smaller. The material is NOT the same (not as soft). There is not much stretch. Very disappointed! Will be sending it back. Undecided if I will go up a size or just not reorder. Not nearly as comfy as the solid ones I purchased (but cute pattern). I am only assuming that any ""print"" (not solid) tank ordered here will have the same results.<br /><br />Note: I am 5'9, 136 lbs, 34 DDD and ordered Medium"
2.0,"One of the socks immediately fell apart before I even put them on. I darned it, thinking that maybe it was just a random manufacturing issue. But now, every single set is damaged beyond repair. I do not wear these outside the house and make sure to gently handle them, but they are socks and thus should be strong enough to handle me wearing them around the house. Cute and soft, but do not recommend. They’ll last you maybe a month."
2.0,"I was so looking forward to wearing this dress but when it arrived, I tried it on and could not even zip it up. I wear a size 8 and a small top but this small wouldn't even fit someone who is a size 0. So disappointing. I gave it a 2 because returning and getting refund went smoothly."
2.0,To small they look like they are for kids
2.0,"This leather band is soft and comfortable, but I can barely get it to fit my large wrist. It fits tightly on the last hole available. It is similar to the ""small"" wristband the Fitbit Versa comes with, and appears very thin as if meant for a ""ladies"" watch. I use the ""large"" Fitbit Versa black band that came with the unit and can tighten that by 6 holes at least. I wish I knew this was a small band, unfortunately, as I cannot use it."
2.0,"Like the earrings very much, but online they looked like a garnet colored cetner iwth simple clear and garnet small dangling stones.  When it arrived, the dangling stones were all mulit-colored.  So, not as simple/chic as I was hoping."
2.0,Was too large for my waist. It seemed as if someone wore it. When i received it the fit was not snug at all. It is elastic. Had to return.
2.0,Sizing is completely inaccurate...size you order is definitely NOT the size that arrives.  Not true to size...way too small.
2.0,I've been wearing these for 5 months and they are tarnished. Don't expect to wear these for a long period of time
2.0,The hat is too thick and doesn't really slouch at all. It sits awkwardly on your head. I even tried it on my daughter who has a smaller head and it doesn't sit nicely on her head either. Wah wah wah!
2.0,It's veryy hot but wayyy too big.. I sized up like it said to and it's HUGE!!! Id stick to regular sizing if buying this... The back of it adjusts so you can make it tighter or looser if need be.
2.0,"Jumper was to short waisted, for tall people. I'm 5'8"" and it was wat to short from top to waistline. I purchased a medium and had to return it. The material was nice, wished it fit."
2.0,The. Product material cheap detail  horrible  sewing at the bottom stitching very bad. The design  is awesome just poorly  made. Will be returning.
2.0,Tiny. Xlarge fit a tiny person
2.0,"I had bought it for my ex, but we broke up before I gave it to him and I decided to keep it. Is unisex, I am a fairly girly and I rocked this watch. I wore it almost every day and a little more than a month in the straps were a little dirty, but that is expected from a leather strap. What I wasn't expecting it was for it to become slow and have to update the time every week and then every day. I was on month three of having it and I dropped it for the first time and one of the handles fell off. I thought this was a great deal and I would get away with having a great, not expensive watch, but this is difenetly not it."
2.0,"This dress fit perfectly! I am tall and dont want a super short dress, and this one was perfect! The only down side is that it is see through. You can see exactly what color/what style underwear you are wearing."
2.0,"Wear small, bought a small<br />The “dress” fit like a short wide tent<br />Returned"
2.0,Arm holes different sizes. I had to return.
2.0,"Personally, the posts were too large to fit through my ears, but I needed something to wear at night when I was sleeping. I'm sure this may work well for someone else, just not for me."
2.0,Extremely small and short! I am usually a M and this looks like it’s made for children.
2.0,Cute suit but not for anyone who is busty. Will be returning. The top part of this is extremely small. Bought an large based on previous reviews.. fits like an xs on top. 5'2 130 34dd
2.0,The design on the fabric is beautiful but the quality of the fabric is very thin. It runs a little larger and the workmanship is not great. I would have purchased more but decided against it after I received this one.
2.0,dress keeps riding up..don't like tugging at my cloths all day
2.0,Is not a good fit and not good quality either
2.0,"2X came out more like a large  I sent it back it took four days to get, the size was off by at least two sizes if not three I wear a 2XL the pants were more like large ridiculous very disappointed I really liked the jogging suit I’m still looking but all the rest  on Amazon or 1 to 2 weeks out I don’t understand Amazon prime is supposed to be today shipping very disappointed"
2.0,"The shirt fits and looks great on, but has no give what so ever!"
2.0,it broke the first day I got it..its very small and the band doesn't really stretch its beautiful and I was so excited but now im just bummed and disappointed
2.0,Muy chiquito quiero devolverlo
2.0,This is the cheapest quality I have seen.  The print was coming off. Its as if it came from Wish . Looks nothing like the picture. Do not buy as gift.
2.0,"I usually LOVE Jambu shoes, but these dig into my ankle and I have to wear the thinnest socks I can find and they are still snug."
2.0,Guess they are okay but not what I thought...MY fault - not theirs
2.0,"This product will NOT fit an adult. I bought it for my 17 year old son who is thin as a rail and it doesn't fit him, it barely fits my 12 year old. overall the finish is decent, not great but will suit most kids needs."
2.0,Large was to small for DD bust.
2.0,"the fabric is viscose. the sizing is small (and I'm small!) the body fit, but the neck is like a vise, barely stretchy at all and not soft in that area, uncomfortable. the bottom has a tighter edge, so it doesn't flow at all, the bottom the torso section is tight in a band that's less elastic than the rest.<br /><br />don't get this one"
2.0,"runs small and very little support, returned."
2.0,I gave these away. I figured if i got a men's jogger that it would fit me a certain way.<br /><br />Well i was slightly wrong.<br /><br />It fit too fitting. I like that loose look and did not want it to be a legging feel or look
2.0,Watch had stop working junk
2.0,Fabric is thin crappy swimsuit like material. Not breathable unless that means see through to you. Cheap and NOT worth buying. Not sure what material people like to wear but it’s about time an honest review gets posted so people do not waste their money or time.
2.0,Cheap and funky size sloppy design
2.0,"Very large and flimsy, feels very cheap and is way too big."
2.0,They are baggy as soon as you wear them and they are cheap material. Lesson learned on this product.
2.0,"Stiff Hard shell formed hat with thin felt covering. I thought it would be full felt but not. Chin strap cheap with plastic bead for tightening. I cut it off. Hat band very cheap and thin, I replaced it. Very unsatisfied!"
2.0,I really liked these pants but the stitching around the zipper started coming apart shortly after I got them. Then the handle of the zipper came off completely. It’s a shame because I really liked how these looked
2.0,It looks pretty but the clock was not working since day 1
2.0,"links fell apart and a stone fell out by the  end of the day, first time I wore it, very pretty but ,don't waste your money"
2.0,"I was super excited about this dress and really liked it when I first bought it. It fit well but the material was a little thin on the top. It becomes a little bit sheer, but I just wore a cami under to hide that.<br /> Today I wore it for the second time and where the seams meet in the neck/shoulder area is coming apart. I’m really disappointed that it already is falling apart. It was only washed one time and worn once before today."
2.0,"buen precio, pero se pusieron negros rapido !!"
2.0,Looks great. The digital and analog only stay in sync for about 48 hours.<br />Wrist strap is held on by very flimbsy engineering. I know this because my second one in three weeks just broke.
2.0,"They don't work, kinda dishearting because she loved them, but the magnets don't work. The day we got them, she found out they didn't work lost one as she walked out of our door!! BUMMER!!!! WON'T BUY AGAIN!!"
2.0,"The fabric was nice, but it clung to my body in lots of spots I with it wouldn’t. I even got a size larger than what I would normally get and it still long bad on me and my personal body type."
2.0,"Have been using it over a month, everyday when I work out. I get very sweaty, but I don't see a difference. I'll keep wearing it since I paid $50 for it."
2.0,Material is too thin and baggy!!
2.0,"In the picture online it looks red and green but when I got it m, it was actually orange and green.  Didn’t have that Christmas vibe and felt more Halloween.  Didn’t love the material either and ended up returning."
2.0,Very cheap and itchy
2.0,Looks nice but catches on everything and  gets loose and Moves around. Very disappointed
2.0,Material is low quality. No prob with the buckle but the &#34;leather&#34; itself bends and creases so easily at first use that mine already has deep marks!! Pretty sure it will tear up with frequent use!
2.0,"It is a bit uncomfortable under the arms,"
2.0,"Decent shirt but it is a &#34;slim&#34; cut.  I wear 2XXL and that is what I ordered, but this shirt is too tight."
2.0,"This backpack has so many great pockets that I was really looking forward to using it. However, on my first backpacking trip with it I was really disappointed and in pain. The hip belt cut into my left hip so bad that I had to loosen it. That resulted in the pack cutting into my shoulders really bad."
2.0,"Rec'd the poncho on time. It came in a crumpled mess in a itsself.  What we mean by that is they use the front pocket as the case for the poncho.  It is very thin material and crumpled up in a ball so it's a mess when you undo it from it's pocket.  I would not purchase this again, but in an immediate need for its use.  I will not recommend this due to it's extreme lightweight materials and appearance.  It is not made extremely well and the sleeves are short for my 6'2"" husband.  Again if you want something cheap, buy it, if not look somewhere else."
2.0,Genuinely the dullest piece of clothing I own.  Will probably wind up being a nightgown.  Have worn it once into the real world and it was sad.
2.0,This cardigan or whatever you want to call it seems to be made out of low quality fabric. Not much stretch so if your arms are a little bigger then they won't fit comfortably in the sleeves. Definitely would not have bought this for $20+ if I knew it was this quality
2.0,The material was too shiny and not in a good way.
2.0,A disappointing buy. More suitable for teen girl than an adult.
2.0,So I absolutely loved the way these sunglasses looked but they broke the second time I wore them. I’m really bummed out because they did look very nice but clearly were cheaply made.
2.0,"This shirt was poor quality, too small on the top, the tassells looked glued together. The whole thing was a mess and I<br />just ended up putting it in my recycling garbage can. Not even worth me trying to go to the time and trouble of sending it back. I wa sooooooooooo disgusted."
2.0,"The tutus were extremely small and tight. I ordered them for a bachelorette party and we still wore them but they were uncomfortably tight. Cheap tutus, but probably wouldn't order them again just for this reason."
2.0,"Very nice pin, just don't wear it on a heavy coat. Mine lasted one day then snapped at the trowel handle that evening."
2.0,Great material but it was too small and it’s not stretchy
2.0,I am absolutely upset 😡.  I am hosting a virtual Secret Santa party and my shirt is ruined. I received my pj's in the mail and after ONE wash this was the result. DO NOT BUY....AMAZON STORE THAT STOLE CHRISTMAS...UNBELIEVABLE
2.0,The quality was pretty bad and the lining inside the jacket was ripped. The buttons on the outside are just for decoration and the jacket does not close. Item was returned.
2.0,I am shorter torso and this is too loose in waist...no tummy control panel at all.
2.0,More than 1/2 of the charms I will not be using because they are dumb. The rest were pretty good.
2.0,It felt cheap and the mid section with the ruching was way to wide for a normal waist line. You'd need a looong torso for this to look good on
2.0,Beautiful pendant but sadly already loosing stones after having it only a month.
2.0,"Hardly looks like the picture. The picture shows shadow and contrast as if it were carved out more, but mine is just solid silver. The cheap paint is chipping off of the dragons right wing, and one of its horns is broken off. Feels very fragile and cheap, and I feel like I've been ripped off. For the price I paid, i expected more."
2.0,I have had this necklace set for a little over a month it has already started to tarnish and has a kink in it. I have only worn them 10ish times.
2.0,These are beautiful but run very small. If you usually wear a medium or small you might be fine.
2.0,The bottom order of the top is too tight for me.
2.0,"Super cheap polyester. Cute, wish the material were better."
2.0,"The one I ordered came with a huge hole in it. I'm using it for a Halloween costume, so I don't care that much but if you're ordering these for a wedding or something make sure to check them. They're certainly cheap."
2.0,"This hat has very poor workmanship. Creases where there shouldn't be and the middle of the front doesn't line up with the middle of the back. I bought this to wear as a soaker hat on our very hot golf courses here in Florida and not for the look, but if it doesn't perform as a soaker hat I will be returning it. Delivered on time, but the box was to small for the hat so the sides had to be curled up and it hasn't returned to form."
2.0,"Material was thin. Size was much smaller than expected, even though I measured my daughter and bought according to the size guide."
2.0,Cheap junk sized for a toddler
2.0,"It was okay.  I work with a great deal of semi and precious stones.  This had no luster or color other than black to it.  Almost looked as though it had not been tombled or polished.  Not matte, just dull. No whites or grays running through it.  Can use it for filler beads so I kept it."
2.0,Thought these were red white and blue.<br />Definitely not red
2.0,"I like the adjustable arms, the lenses help avoid eye strain or having to take them on and off.  However, the frames are so large, they look silly. Wish they had lighter color options, as it might not be so noticable. I had bought these to wear for work, but I only use them at home. Bummer. Would be fine for those with larger head sizes."
2.0,The lace at the bottom is shredded and it's fraying at the place where the straps meet the cami...normal wear nothing extreme but the product does not hold up well
2.0,The fabric of this skirt is horrible. Stiff and full of wrinkles and it would be difficult to iron them out. It fit as expected and that's the only plus. It's getting sent back!
2.0,I had to return this it runs extremely small and the material is thin. It would look cute on petite woman
2.0,This skirt was not very flattering- I have a bit of a tummy and it cut right into the widest part. It also doesn’t flare out or anything- just follows your body all the way down which did not look good on me. I prefer a swim skirt with a looser fit on the skirt part and this one fit just like a pencil skirt and the waistband cut my stomach in half which was not a good look.
2.0,Broke really fast. Clear clasp very small. Very fair product.
2.0,"My pics show what I ordered and what I actually received. To say that I am upset is an understatement. The band that was shipped has just a magnet NOT a buckle clasp. The band is also super thick, as shown, the color is COMPLETELY different, and it’s a slip on like a bracelet. I’ll just got to Target or Walmart to buy a watch band from now on."
2.0,Second sweater I purchased first one was beige with a flaw (broken running stitch)on inside of collar. I will be returning the beige sweater.  Gave as a gift
2.0,They are a very nice set but the short are to short lol
2.0,The sizing on this is way off. I bought my normal size Medium and I could barely get the waistband over one thigh. The fabric has almost no stretch and there's no zipper or anything to help it get on. I ended up returning instead of exchanging because I had no idea what size to even order because it was so small and had no stretch. The fabric was also kind of weird and not what I was expecting.
2.0,"Cute shirt but way too small. Unless they sent the wrong size, this looked for like a small or medium than an xl!  Or maybe an xl in girl's size?"
2.0,Not a good fit and the should straps don't cut it.
2.0,"These are advertised as leggings, but they are actually tights.  I wanted something completely opaque, and while these provide good coverage for tights, they're still exactly that - tights.  There is also banding around the leg openings that is very tight - you better have tiny calves or they're going to be pinched.  Other than the leg opening the size seems accurate - I normally wear an XL and these fit fine."
2.0,Was bigger than I thought and the ends are not curly.
2.0,These socks are very thin and honestly not as full as the photos. They are not good for the gym. Definitely more suitable for a Halloween costume.
2.0,Not true to the picture
2.0,Looks really cute but it broke within 3 hours !!!
2.0,This dress is not true to size. It's way to small. Definitely order up
2.0,"I ordered this first in a medium for my husband, based on the reviews.  He is not a large man but likes to have room in his sweatshirts to wear a shirt underneath it. The medium was just a little too small, not the huge size as suggested by the reviews.  So, I sent it back and ordered the large, which is the size my husband usually wears.  The large came in and the neck opening is huge while the rest of the sweatshirt is fine.  I ended up sending this sweatshirt back.  I will have to buy a different brand and try my luck there.  Very disappointing as the price was good and service was great both returning and sending out new ones.  I had ordered red and black and both were sent back.  Would not recommend buying."
2.0,Hate it terrible the sides where not even sown together I will send back
2.0,Broke after second wear 😢
2.0,This products hurts my nose to the point it pierced itself . I had a bump on the inside and outside of my nose . It always left a nasty bruise that's still noticeable to this day .
2.0,The design is good but too flimsy or soft didn't meet my expectations.
2.0,"of the 40 maybe 25 worked, and beware they die very fast. The ones that worked give intense bright light, so I was happy about that. Burning Man Users, great to use for bikes for maybe 2 hrs max. :)"
2.0,Super cute and my daughter loved it until the clasp broke the 2nd day she had it. :-(
2.0,Cheap material!!  It faded and looked really old the first time I washed it!!!
2.0,Make sure you are aware how small the cross is before buying it.
2.0,It's very thin 2 to much $ this hat
2.0,"size 7 with a size 5 waist..pretty, but cheap, for a fits most sizes, the ends don't even meet when tied.."
2.0,"This dress looks so cheaply made - I would be embarrassed to wear it in public, so I'm returning it."
2.0,"Returned item, did not like the fit. Too fitted around waist for me. Retailer was easy to deal with on return. Thank you"
2.0,"Update dropping some stars : less than 24hrs I have small tears.  The purse was taken to my work and at my desk all day. Nothing extreme or abusive could have happened to it  Not a durable purse handle with care.<br /><br />Just got this tonight.  This morning while reading the Q&A I was disappointed by responses stating the long strap was not removable because the feature photos appeared so. However, I got my bag this evening and it came with shoulder strap unattached.  It connects with snap buttons.  I'll include photos (lighting makes metal look gold, but indeed silver).<br /><br />  I've been carrying a large hobo and wanted<br />something smaller and woth a more solid shape but still fit my stuff.<br /><br />  What I carry: wallet, Olympus micro 4/3 with lens attached and extra lens inside it's own protective pouch, phone, keys,  compact mirror, lipstick, powder compact, and some smaller items and cards in the zipper pouches."
2.0,Was falling apart and threads coming loose on day 1.
2.0,Dress runs a little small and is not well made. The stripes do not line up.  Returned the dress but have not gotten any response regarding the refund.  Also I had to pay to return the dress so will not order from this seller again.
2.0,"The touch screen pad works, but they make my thumbs and index fingers get cold while I'm riding my bike."
2.0,"This shirt runs smaller than usual. And it is dry cleaning only, so I am a bit disappointed with it."
2.0,"Fit was as expected.  Material seems a bit thin and not a cozy-warm cardigan, but a good accessory to an outfit. After 1 month of wear however, a large hole developed in the armpit seam.  I purchased two different colors at the same time, and only one has a hole on the seam.  I will probably not buy this particular cardigan again."
2.0,Looks nothing like the picture when you get it
2.0,This item is not the best item it actually looks hilarious on everybody has made fun of me since I bought it every time I wear it they said it looks like a moo moo dress
2.0,Wide neck. 3/4 length sleeves. Great for heavy set women.
2.0,Returned them. To big for me
2.0,It was a cheap product
2.0,"It doesn't even look like denim to me unfortunately, its a thin color is very similar to blue denim but not real denim. I usually wear a medium in most things, and this is very very roomy. I really wanted a denim knee length dress and this would've been perfect except its so roomy and not flattering on my body type., hits below my knee almost to shin. 130lbs 36b, size 4 pants 5'2. Even with the belt it just has too much fabric on the bottom, debated weather to sew it up a little but who has time for that."
2.0,"In Iowa the temperature get very cold.  I still had to wear two pairs of socks at 50 degrees and I work indoors.  So I was not very impressed as I thought my feet would have been warmer.  So, the temperature is more at 60 degrees and I don’t need to wear tights or extra socks when I wear them."
2.0,I have a tiny wrist and one of them broke. I know it's not because I couldn't even get it over my knuckles because it broke.<br />The other two bracelets are beautiful though
2.0,"Not one of favorite items , looks cheap"
2.0,"I bought these because I needed a few pairs, and the photo of these looked exactly like the ones that go for twice as much. Well, they do look like the pictures. However, the mechanism between the pieces of wood (they don’t smell of cedar AT ALL) feels quite flimsy. They fit my wide calf boots, but they’re easily knocked out of place. They’re better than the plastic ones, but by golly, I can’t imagine that these are the best around."
2.0,I think these are great shoes.  I am rating them low because I clearly order Men’s DayLite Hiker.  What received were Women’s DayLite Hiker.  On the fortunate side they fit my wife and she thought they were extremely comfortable.  She’s going to keep them  and I will try another order of Men’s DayLite Hikers.  If I get the correct order this time I may be willing to up my rating.
2.0,"This doesn’t look like the picture, and runs small. It looks pretty cheap and ridiculous."
2.0,Well made but you better have a small head.
2.0,Queda lindo pero es un poco transparente la tela y se te ve todo el chon haha
2.0,"The quality varied pair by pair, some had the right amount of stretch, some barely stretched at all and were hard to get around my heal.  I got a couple good pairs out to the pack, but I'll probably throw the rest out."
2.0,It looks OK
2.0,Nice purse. I ordered the color burnt sienna but what i got was like faded color.  It was disappoiting. That is why 2 stars.
2.0,"These trunks are cut a little wonky. The one leg is a little shorter than the other and the outside of the thigh is longer than the inside. The mesh inside is baggy and the leg holes are super wide. They'll be great for my son to wreck while he's away at camp, but I wouldn't get them again."
2.0,Not high waisted but low and I have no idea how the belt goes . Looks nothing like picture. These are really bad. But Amazon refunded me. That's why I will always be an amazon customer. There was no tags. Not good
2.0,Looks great in the photo but you can not read it in person.  It just looks cheap.  it was...my fault!
2.0,This was more of a Jersey fabric than it appears in the photos. I'm tall and curvy - I can't imagine this looking good on anyone with any curves!
2.0,This belt slips and doesn't stay in place.
2.0,They smelled bad like mildew.
2.0,"After a few washings(following the washing instructions)  the shirt shrunk in length. I am 6'3"" and it now barely covers my belt."
2.0,The arms are extremely narrow at the top.
2.0,"return anklet, too small."
2.0,"If they were regular sweats, the waistband would probably do just fine. But they are heavy thermal pants, and so it’s not up to the task. If you are a heavier gent, with the waistline to match, you will probably love these, especially in cooler weather. At 6’2” and 185lbs, they slide off the minute I put something heavy, like a cell phone, in my pocket."
2.0,Waist too large.  Sizes run large.  Returned these
2.0,"Definitely check the sizing measuments. I ordered based off that and it's still slightly too small. Was hoping it'd be more true to that as opposed to just ordering my regular size. It ships from China, so that's why the sizing is messed up and it takes longer for delivery and that. I always have issues with sizing when I order something from China so I usually try to avoid it, but I really liked this shirt. I wouldn't order it again because of the sizing issue."
2.0,"This was absolutely horrific... It was not even worth the money to even send it back!!! The fabric was so frigging thin it was just absolutely pathetic....  I would have been absolutely ashamed to have sent this out.....<br /><br />I am so sorry, I normally would not write such a bad review... I would try to find something nice to say, oh the packaging was nice, oh it had a nice bow, oh the hand writing was elegant... no..... nothing was  nice it was all crap... every single bit of it was crap..."
2.0,very small like a baby size ..
2.0,"I read a few other reviews that said the boots run small.  I usually wear 8.5 so I ordered 9.  Couldn't even get them on my feet.  The run VERY small and narrow too.  I won't even begin to guess what size I would need to even be able to put them on.  The pair I got was a little scuffed in the box too, not sure if that was the style or if they had a very rough trip across the country getting to me."
2.0,"Ordered this because it's very difficult for me to find cute, strappy sports bras that fit properly and I was hoping the clasp back would be the ticket.  I'm a 32D and a medium was too large around.  Width wise, a medium would probably fit a 34-36.  &#34;Cups&#34; were definitely way too small for a D cup, but given it's a sports bra, I didn't really expect them to fit like a regular bra.  Straps on this one were shorter than a different color and strap orientation of the same &#34;brand&#34;, which was good for me being 5'2&#34;."
2.0,"These look cool out of the box but aren't gunmetal. We were coordinating all gunmetal jewelry and hardware for the suit. These are advertised as gunmetal but look far more black. Unfortunately, the skull came off of the time tack the very first use. We will be returning them."
2.0,The fabric is soft and it is a pretty color. That's about all I can say that's positive about this shirt. It is not a quality garment. It's nothing like the picture. I normally wear a medium or large and I ordered a double x and it still does not come as low as they show it in the picture. The picture shows it covering her behind this barely makes it to my hips or Beltline. Waste of money. A teen girl would probably like it pretty well
2.0,Liked the material but item too small
2.0,"While it fits nicely around my neck and does absorb water quickly, if you're out in the heat it loses it's cool rather quickly. Yes it stays wet but not cold or even cool. Very disappointed, I'll keep using a cloth kept in a bag with ice cubes, it stays cool"
2.0,The clasp was broken so I returned it for a replacement. The new knecklace isn't broken but.. both came in a plastic bags. The description states it would come in a box. Looks very cheap and not presented the way it should be. I am going to keep it because the charm is cute.
2.0,They're very heavy
2.0,"Cheap, broken very easily"
2.0,I read the description and it made it seem like it was gonna be both pants and the sweatshirt but only the sweatshirt came.
2.0,Not long like photo
2.0,Necklace looks beautiful. Picture is beautiful. How ever it feel apart within a week. The picture feel off. The charm broke off the moon then the moon broke off the chain.
2.0,"Runs small, fabric is too thin for shorts."
2.0,Was way to small.
2.0,"I ordered an XL to begin with and the top fit perfectly but the bottoms were just a tad too small, I returned and ordered a 2XL when the swimsuit came in, it was twice as small as the one I ordered originally. It also looked like it wasn't made by the same company as the skirting was made from an entirely lower quality material. I really love the swimsuit and had the XL bottoms fit like an XL I would have kept the bathing suit because I loved the style. I am perplexed at how the sizes changed. Though I got my products in exceptionally quick (which I was very pleased about ) I'm wondering if maybe the two bathing suits came from different sources though through the same company."
2.0,Very cute but no give to it at all. I can’t even get it on
2.0,very cheap looking but then again they were very cheap.  they might look cute on though
2.0,Broke within first day of wearing
2.0,"The shoulders don’t really like to stay up and it cuts across the butt in a funny way. I really had to stuff my arms in the sleeves as well. Have only worn once. For reference, I’m 5’3” and about 130lbs."
2.0,"Bottom line, these glasses are just fine. That’s it. Very average and not even polarized, yet going for $60??? I promise they are not worth near that. Also, these should be advertised as men’s, as they are HUGE. Literally fell off my face as I looked down. Super bummed bc they looked badass online but turned out to be the typical cheap plastic, non-polarized, men’s-sized glasses. Had to return them..."
2.0,"Top handle broke on day two. Poor stichwork on a thin material.<br />Backpack straps are not designed well, with the straps pulled uncomfortably snug the pack still sits low enough that it rests on the fender of my bike and rubs the paint."
2.0,The quality wasn't great. The socks also began to stretch after just trying them on. They are thick though.
2.0,"Update 11/21/18: I wanted to give an update on this wallet and have subtracted a couple of stars to the build quality of the money clip.  The wallet has not lasted me a year yet and the money clip has become loose and will no longer provide pressure to hold my bills.  Also, there's no customer support that I can find anywhere online to get a warranty claim on this.<br /><br />Wanted to replace my current wallet and came over this.  I like the added feature of RFID protection.  Not sure if this actually works as I can't test it out, so I am relying on what is described.  The wallet has a slight velvet feel to it.  I love the money clip in the bifold area.  No more having to stuff my cash in one of the pockets.  I use the pocket with the thumb slot for my building and garage ID's and it reads fine.  There are plenty of pockets to put all of your cards in.  You can stuff about 3-4 cards in each pocket and it doesn't add much thickness to the wallet.  Would definitely recommend."
2.0,To small for my daughter order a bigger size up
2.0,The earring is beautiful but made with such heavy metal that its painful and looks awkward because of the way it pulls on the lobes.
2.0,"I received this nice bracelet as a gift and lost it the third time I wore it.  There is no clasp to secure the bracelet, just a large open ring through which the end of the bracelet is inserted loosely.  It fell off my wrist twice prior to a third time when, not feeling it drop, I lost it.  It opens easily putting on a coat, jacket or other clothing.  I'm sad to have lost it.  Enjoyed having it.  Valued the sentiment behind the gift, but it's gone.  The means to secure this bracelet to the wrist needs to be redesigned."
2.0,"love the print, fits different than other Leggings Depot products"
2.0,"The pin is high quality and very much what I expect,however it is not the same as the picture describes. The arrow in the mocking jays mouth in the picture goes down, as it does in the movie and book. The arrow in the mocking jays mouth that I received goes up. These were gifts for my students who excelled in a ""Hunger Games"" game played in my PE classes. My male winners didn't notice the difference, but my female participants did. I had to apologize for the problem and show them what I had ordered and what I received. They were happy they won the prize, but saddened that it wasn't like Katniss'."
2.0,meh. just didn't like them.
2.0,"It doesn't really hold the uke onto you since it will fall forward if you take your right hand away. It doesn't look quite right either. I had to try it before I got a more guitar-like strap that I had to also buy buttons for and drill holes into the uke to attach. honestly, though, I suggest you just save your money and buy the guitar style strap. It works perfectly and drilling holes in my uke did not seem to bother it at all! I went to youtube to get instructions on exactly how to do that first though. Good idea!"
2.0,Xl is huge and its not as thick as i thought
2.0,It is way to small. It is my fault I did not check it out as I should.
2.0,The gold ring turned my toe green. Not pleased with this ring. Still think it's cute though
2.0,"Too small across the shoulders and rides up your pits.  Fabric is scratchy, inflexible, and less breathable than you would think."
2.0,"Product was comfortable once on, but was very difficult to take off. You are unable to unzip the front zipper all the way. The whole point to a front zipper is to make it easier to take on and off, but since you can’t unzip it all the way, you still have to pull it over your head. So there was no real point to the front zipper at all."
2.0,"Cheap material. Sweater pulls easily & arrived with large pull on the back of the sweater despite being sealed in a plastic bag. It fits as pictured, but just not worth the money."
2.0,They are not very supporting
2.0,I thought this had a sweat band but it does not. Kinda disappointed.
2.0,"I am somewhat tall, and this hit me right below the belly button. Can't wear it."
2.0,I have been using Red Brand products for 4 decades. The last 10 years or so the quality has gone down hill continuously. I had to resole a pair recently because the sole crumbled away from the center outward.<br />The mink oil is mink oil with a brand name that once stood for quality.
2.0,"The top doesn't look like photo, and bottoms are a little small"
2.0,Very odd fit.  Had to return it.  Pretty though and came with an extender.
2.0,Had many holes all over the fabric it that I didn't see at 1st -had to spend hours sewing them up on Halloween morning😠<br />Check it all over closely when you get it<br />Super cute though & fits great
2.0,"The first product I received leaked from around the tube connector, this was duly replaced by Amazon, which also leaked around the connector. Both times it leaked simply when filling the bladder with water, wearing it riding meant that the bottom of the backpack was dripping water."
2.0,The snap at the top of the blouse was installed incorrectly. It was two of the same pieces so it couldn’t snap closed.
2.0,"Its a beautiful dress, just not for short people with a large bust."
2.0,"Cute but they turn your finger green than the ring turns black after 1 hr of wearing, after buying your not gonna get to wear them or your just gonna have to throw them away"
2.0,I ordered a small but it was a large and it is huge! I think I will keep it as a swimsuit cover up or try and take it in.
2.0,"Wasn't very sturdy, bought it as a gift. It wouldn't close evenly and ended up being thrown away."
2.0,"I’ve been having good luck with online luck, and I guess my luck ran out. Not sure what percent of this is cotton...less than 5, for sure. Looks like a picture of the sweater in the images was printed on some polyester Halloween costume. Zero breathability because of the lack of cotton, so I felt instantly sweaty and cold at the same time. fabric is super scratchy. Bought a size up because that’s what you got to do, and it still fit tight. Returned."
2.0,runs small bit fits perfect and its polyester so it makes you sweat and stink!!!!!
2.0,Didn't like length
2.0,The dress is nice. It’s a little thin but I expected that. The only reason I gave it two stars is because it came “damaged” with what looks to be two bleach stains or discoloring in two areas. Smaller spot on back and larger spots in front by pocket. I was so eager to wear the dress 😔
2.0,"Size was correct but, wood had splinters."
2.0,"Mine arrived with a hole, had to sew it...that’s what I was afraid of...but it’s a really cute bag 😭😭 i want another one!"
2.0,"Wore it twice and the stitching came out of it.  The metal nose bridge is made out of a bread tie.  Seller was slow to ship.  Wouldn't recommend this product.  The material is nice, but the printed image is blurry."
2.0,I wear an xlarge so I ordered an xxlarge. It is sooo tight I will have to give it to my medium sized daughter. It is way smaller than it is sized.
2.0,"The Pin is very high quality and looks great on my bag! The pin fits nicely into the back piece and doesn't feel like it'll come loose. Very satisfied<br /><br />Edit:<br />The pin fell off of the metal pin piece that secures it. So now, all I'm left with is the pin and a little piece that you put the pin into but not the pin itself. It fell off somewhere now it's gone. I don't know how it managed to entirely separate itself from the little pen but I'm really disappointed because I loved this pin alot"
2.0,Its made very cheap material n I don't think it would last very long after a wash. I returned it.
2.0,It's too small!
2.0,"Too short, but could be cute. Nicer material than I had thought."
2.0,"I have been needing some comfortable tanktops and these are not them. They are a bit too snug, the material isn't soft at all, more like biker shorts material (if that makes sense) and they are pretty stiff. It was uncomfortable like wearing a bra too long, once I took it off I felt such a relief. Sorry but I'm not impressed with these."
2.0,It seems like great quality but the x-small is still too small for me :(
2.0,"Pink color/fabric material was see through and too thin to wear as a daytime dress, but might be okay for a pool cover up. I ordered a small and the fit/length was good. Pockets were different than pictured; you can see the seams of the pockets from the front of the dress"
2.0,"Not as picture. It’s very dark,"
2.0,I love the color but the shape it came it was horrible. The packaging was great I don’t think that was the problem. The material isn’t firm like the brim. It’s more soft felt so that’s a disappointment. I don’t even know how I could get the wrinkles out of the top part. It fits large too. Was hoping it would fit a little tighter with the measurements given. Overall just disappointed.
2.0,Way smaller than it should have been
2.0,Returned. The material was uncomfortable and scratchy. The top for really weirdly. Cheaply made. The model makes it look better than it is. I’ll pass.
2.0,Both faces go much slower than reality. It loses about 20 minutes in a day. I need to return it.
2.0,I'd be terrified to wear these in -30f like they are advertised for. My fingers all got cold while shovelling it positive 30f. Are they waterproof? Yes. Are they comfortable? Very. To the touch screen fingertips work? Barely. Should they ever be worn in -30f? Absolutely not.
2.0,I love this top so I ordered at my regular size and it was too snug. I ordered it a second time a size bigger and that size fit even tighter than my regular size. I am returning it again this time for a return of my money. So sad the plus sizes are not true to fit.
2.0,Product is too small and doesn't come any larger.
2.0,The romper is adorable but the size is way off from US sizing......so now it's of no use to anyone in the family since we are all too large for the small medium
2.0,The coat is pretty. And my daughter loved it. But almost instantly the zipper completely broke and I was very disappointed.
2.0,"I'm a large man and this is a little tight on my wrist. But otherwise, simple and stylish."
2.0,"The 3x was more like a women's 12 than an 18. The stitching is crooked, and the fabric feels flimsy."
2.0,Mask finally came...almost a month later than expected.<br />Not as cute in real life as photo but I like it and will use it.
2.0,Way too big for what I needed
2.0,The jacket is cute but the sleeve cuffs go above the wrist. Not 3/4 length and not quite long sleeved. Weird
2.0,Too snug and I expected a bit better quality for the price
2.0,"They run pretty large, but still quite comfortable. However, since they are not very pretty in person, I only wore them about 4 times and noticed that one of the straps broke already, so going in the trash since it's been 1.5 months since purchase and can't return"
2.0,Poor quality. Zippers broke when unzipping to pack. Laundry bags are not good for anything but maybe makeup.
2.0,"I like the shape of this skirt, and S fits perfectly (5.6, 135lbs). However, it looks like plastic, not faux leather."
2.0,"Ordered a half size smaller, based upon reviews. Still too large - the backstrap does not fit snugly around the heel at even the tightest setting. This looseness causes chaffing.The webbing onto which the leather is sewn is not very compliant.<br />The plastic keeper on the top of the front draw strings came off at the first tug. I had to tie the strings together to maintain tightness.<br />I wore them for three months and threw them out."
2.0,going to gift this it is waaaayyyyyy too big surprisingly.... my xl looks more  like a 3X its is a pretty dress but I was terribly disappointed
2.0,I was disappointed that this was such a “boxy” fitting tunic. I returned it after trying it on.
2.0,These earrings were way bigger than I expected. I was hoping they were smaller and more minimalistic but I don’t think I’ll ever wear most of them because they’re just too big and flashy.
2.0,"The print on this dress was great but the sizing was all over the place. I have a very small bust and the dress was tight across the chest and on my arms. That said it had quite a bit of length. I am 5'4"" and this ran about at my ankles. For reference, I tend to carry more weight in my hips and thighs and this dress was great for that but very odd proportionally - may need to order a few sizes to try."
2.0,The bra was true to size and it does stay in place just fine. The thing I didn’t like about it was that it made me look like I had 1 giant boob. The is no separation support at all. Not sure if any strapless bra will have any support for heavier chests.
2.0,I am glad I sized up. They have a very odd waist band that reminds me of maternity pants but with some cheap spandex. The band is constantly rolling down. I would not buy again and would have returned had I not removed the tag.
2.0,"Insanely big. In order to make it fit, you have to fold it up, however the sweat pad makes it super tacky so you’re better off ripping it off. Doing this makes the button unusable as it’s folded inwards."
2.0,It is extremely hard ... my husband cannot use it because it hurts his knees.
2.0,"The ivory dress is WHITE. I had ordered this for my sister-in-law’s wedding, and realized too late that it is the wrong color!"
2.0,Just  did  not  fit  like  picture.
2.0,Rings are built relatively well. Unfortunately only 2 of the 5 rings actually spin.
2.0,"Sizing was about 2 sizes too small so order up.  Also, it didn't look like the pic."
2.0,"In the picture, it looks nice and classy. In reality, it looks like it came from the thrift store. It is smaller than the medium here. This would be extra small here. But I did not know this is not made in the US."
2.0,"After giving them my own measurements, they sent me a complete wrong size wedding dress. The dress is too small and they did not use my own customized measurements. The quality of the dress is good, but wrong size was sent, it’s way too small. I cannot wear this on my wedding, and I’m disappointed that they did not follow my measurements. It’s honestly and unfortunately waste of money as alterations will cost me more than the dress. Buyers be aware!"
2.0,Product says 100% cotton but feels like polyester
2.0,Beautiful looking but once you sweat or get slightly wet it turns colors
2.0,Totally cheap. Poorly made and nearly see through.  I was bummed cause I love the throwback design.  Too big and felt stretched out before even wearing it.
2.0,fit was way too small
2.0,"Off color, I wanted white. The picture howled white."
2.0,"Won’t stay in place. Just when I thought I had them on correctly, I barely touched one of them, and it moved out of position immediately. Very disappointed."
2.0,"I am not a fan. It is a bit short, and the cuffs are really small. I expected a better quality garment."
2.0,"Don't waste your time ordering this.  The arms are too small, and unless you're completely flat-chested, don't expect this to fit at all.  I even ordered a size up from what I normally wear, and it was STILL too small.  Terrible wast of my time and money."
2.0,"Decent jeans. Certainly highwaisted, but the holes fall way below the knee and that's just not what I'm looking for."
2.0,Too small and VERY poorly made. I (personally) would not purchase this hat again.
2.0,"Bought this a few months ago and I've worn it about a dozen times. Today I wore it in reasonably heavy rain, and it soaked straight through. So disappointing! Love the look and style though, and in light showers it's good, but if you need to stay dry, choose something else."
2.0,"The picture made the dress seem much better quality than it actually was. It was huge and unflattering, I immediately returned it."
2.0,Very pretty but missing one of the main stones.  Not enough time to return because I need it for a party.
2.0,quite sheer
2.0,Fits great. Colors are nice.  Very comfortable.  Problems are:  straps don’t stay hooked & dark solid material stained my skin blue after I was out of the pool.
2.0,The band holder broke within 2 weeks.  Not impressed
2.0,Not my favorite at all
2.0,"I bought this for a gift and when it finally arrived from an overseas market, it was tarnished.  Due to the low price and the distance that it would of have to been to send it back, I did not return it.  The item says it is a silver bracelet in the name but, the item description did not say it was sterling silver.  I am not sure if it was or wasn't but, I was really disappointed in the quality of the item and did not believe it to be silver."
2.0,"The brims are wavy and crooked, not straight. They were sent in a box, so they were not damaged in shipping. They look terrible.<br />Also, the ribbons in the listing photos show a nice Halloween orange ribbon on them... the ones I received have yellow ribbons."
2.0,These sunglasses are not unisex. I bought these for my husband and they have very large round lens. Nice but defiantly not for a man.
2.0,"Its way smaller than I expected, don&#34;t really care for it"
2.0,Not what I expected. The knot was nice but the sweater did not fit. It came above my knees and the sleeves were about 2 inches above my wrist. I would not purchase again.
2.0,This is NOT genuine leather!!!!!!
2.0,Pros: Small. Fun sound. Not too loud.<br />Cons: Had to request exchange since one didn’t work. Same issue with the replacement!
2.0,"they work well and let a little light from the bottom around the nose.  Other wise they are total dark.  will use again.<br /><br />after a time of use.  separation of fabric happens in a month and a half. on the inside of the mask.  exposed a sponge like layer, nice but need to last longer."
2.0,Had it 2days and holster ripped off.  Very cheap quality for the price.
2.0,It is too loose and doesn’t cover your face well enough to speak while wearing it
2.0,"After measuring my prescription glasses I ordered 2 of these sunglasses, but neither pair was anywhere near large enough to cover my regular glasses."
2.0,Love the ring but faded quickly
2.0,Cute set of bracelets however the “USA” bracelet was put together wrong and when read it was backwards.
2.0,I don't know if this is a regular problem but they really irritated my nose. Near the end of the day they actually started to hurt. I had to take it out and wait for the inflammation before putting in my original jewelry.
2.0,"Cute pattern but that's about all that's positive. Came as a wadded up mess. Flimsy material that reminds me of what generic, cheap polyester, Halloween costumes are made of. Shirt is a midriff cut."
2.0,Fine. Kinda works. Only touched on one side which is weird. And massive saggy arm pit holes.
2.0,The sweatshirt size was small
2.0,the wristband is very cheap and breaks EXTREMELY easily!
2.0,The fabric is thin and top portion is loose
2.0,"The leopard print material is like cheap, thin, print costume material... u can’t even call this fabric and the mesh is like a cheaper version of sports jersey material. I’m 5’3, size 4, 134lbs, S in leggings and went with a M per other reviewers. I do also suggest u size up. The M was a good fit. Some stretch, not a lot, I feel like it rode up a bit and if you’re curvier than me (I have no curves) these won’t be the most comfortable fit on u either. Nor did these have much compression especially in the waist. The waistband looks wide but it’s held up by one of those thin elastic bands on the inside. See pics if you’re not sure what I mean. Those bands that usually twist in the wash and then the waistband never stays right again. I have washed these and so far I will honestly say it hasn’t twisted.  I hate that the waistband does flip down which is really annoying when I’m working out and it absorbs sweat so I was kinda stinky after my workout. Also I got these because I thought the style was cool and would look fun when I’m working out but it cut my lower half in a weird way and made me look shorter and squatter than I am. The ruching in the booty was a little flattering on my flat booty but not comfortable when doing squats.<br />Just skip these, u can get way better quality leggings for about the same price as these."
2.0,"If you buy, choose 2 sizes up!"
2.0,"I did not like piecing together all the pieces on the watch… In fact, it is still not put together nor has it been worn"
2.0,"There was nothing wrong with the belts quality or anything, they were just too small for my niece."
2.0,Not the mirror kind...but nice.
2.0,"Nice large bed, seemed like plenty of padding, but I returned the bed upon receiving due to the look. The description is deceiving. The bedding had a tinsel looking fabric sewn into the bed so it looked like a dog bed meets glitter and Christmas. I will say though the bed did arrive the next day after ordering despite it not being an Amazon prime item."
2.0,It looks slim but when you put it on it is bulky looking.  Disappointing because it looks attractive in the picture but just a bulky looking on
2.0,The material was a poor quality.
2.0,Looks alright but it's nothing more than cheap vinyl decals on a generic plate. The decals on mine are peeling off by themselves upon arrival. Also this is my bad for not paying attention but shipping was $14.99 and took about 3 weeks. I'd rather be assimilated by the borg than purchase this again ...
2.0,The braid came off almost immediately.  Had to sew it back on.
2.0,Dress is super cute but too SHORT! I am 5'2 and the dress stopped just under my butt.  I ordered an XL and it fit perfectly but returned it bc it was too short to wear to the event I purchased it for. For sizing purposes  I'm about 200lbs and wear DDD bra.
2.0,"I thought they would be of better quality, from looking at the picture. But they're a little flimsier and seem of cheaper quality in person."
2.0,"I am 5’6 1/2” tall, weigh 138- 140 lbs! Thought a large would fit because I can wear a medium too! Said runs small! I can squeeze into them put uncomfortable! Going to return for an X-L! A size I never wear, but they are so soft and pretty! Want to try again!💕✌🏼"
2.0,I liked these gloves for nightly use with lotion but  they did not hold up well with repeated washing.the fit was great for my hands which are small.
2.0,Crooked and hit my cheeks. Not as nice as photo. Wouldn't recommend.
2.0,This belt was very cheap quality. It was creased and wrinkled already when we received it.
2.0,Awfull. Cloudy wouldn't even consider as a gift unless to kid
2.0,"This was a great fitting tank nice and loose.  I don't prefer tight workout tops.  However, it shrank to half the size when I washed it.  I bought a second one and hung to dry.  Same issue.  Disappointing- loved the original fit and color."
2.0,"Very upset because this is not what the description said. This is a skater dress, not a T-shirt/shift dress. Also the red is a lot darker (like blood) than it shows on the picture. The dress itself if not bad, and is good quality, but I wanted this for a Lilo costume and it will just not work, nor is it my style."
2.0,"These earrings are very heavy, too heavy for my ears"
2.0,Super cheap fabric.
2.0,See photo.  My 2 liter bottle of coke nearly fills the 5 liter bag.  Bag look ok otherwise - thus the 2 stars.  i am keeping it and will use is for something.  Price is  a little steep for a smaller size.
2.0,"These compression socks truly compress, which is what they are made for. I give them an A+ for that. But, they unfortunately are made in such a way that the colors in the socks, which look fine on the outside, are very loose threads on the inside, and thus very good at snagging toenails. Unless you keep your toenails trimmed constantly, then these will be of little comfort putting on each day, or however often you need them.  I feel bad having to write this, as socks that work so well for such an important job are  hard to find in this economical range."
2.0,It's Way shorter than described
2.0,"The pants were extremely wide. The material of the pants is very light. Since the pants were wide, the outfit as a whole was not that cute when put on."
2.0,"One of the two antlers came in broken. Luckily I only needed one. They’re great for a one hour use or so, I wouldn’t recommend them for anything longer than that."
2.0,"I purchased because it looked like a designer dress I had bought at a fraction of the cost.  I was hoping to save some $$.  However, I could see the difference in quality immediately, especially in the cut, material, and embroidery.  The cut was not too flattering.  The designer dress had a lot of volume in the skirt, and the sleeves were more cap-sleeve style.  The collar would lay closer to the neck, but the one from Amazon stood straight up, and also didn't have a button at the back to close it.  The material of this one was more itchy and stiff, and the lining wasn't as luxurious.  It felt like the kind of material you find on a Halloween costume.  And lastly, the embroidery wasn't as vibrant as the designer dress because the stitching was more sparse.  Threads were loose everywhere.  After the comparison, I definitely couldn't keep it.  I returned the dress.  And even if I didn't have the comparison, I don't think I could keep it.  You will find a better quality dress at $45 elsewhere."
2.0,For the price it’s ok for regular day to day usage . Definitely won’t last in a couple of hikes after going out for one last week with them . The sole will cave in and you’ll be buying another boot within 3-4 months if used on the daily .
2.0,"I bought this top in black & navy blue, both size medium. When I put one up against the other, I can clearly see an obvious difference in sizing. The navy top fits like a small & the black top fits like a large. I am SO fed up with clothing MADE IN CHINA that's NOT TRUE TO SIZE."
2.0,"Advertised as 4 pairs of hoops in gold, rose gold, silver and black and 1 pair of gold octagon.  I ordered because I wanted the silver and black pairs especially but I did not receive either one. I received hoops: 1 gold pair, 1 rose gold pair and 2 gold rhinestone pairs and 1 gold octagon pair. What came was not what was advertised."
2.0,"Sorry forgot to take pictures. Quickly discovered this wouldn't work.<br />Has very little stretch & no buttons or zippers. Ordered XL, dress appears to run small.<br /><br />Couldn't fit head via collar to try on. The chain on back looks inexpensive and fragile. Would be afraid of it tarnishing or breaking when washing...returned."
2.0,Can I return it for a bigger size like a 1xl or 2xl?
2.0,Not as cute in person as it is in the pictures.
2.0,I can't stand when they don't give you the full view of the hat. I like the RBZ with a bit of yellow. What they don't show is the orange R1 on the other side of the hat. It makes it too busy for me and I HATE competing colors on a hat. The price was the only thing keeping it from a 1 star rating.
2.0,"Usually a 2x bought a 3x for layering, wayyyyyyy too small."
2.0,Eyes are soo messed up
2.0,"I bought these for my 97 year old father, don’t stretch, he doesn’t like them.  The grip is great.  But since he tried a pair I’m  stuck with them"
2.0,This is much smaller than I had expected.  I guess I didn't pay attention to the size.
2.0,"Nice design but fabric is thin polyester type, wired feeling for a tee shirt"
2.0,"I ordered size L as I am usually size 12. I couldn't even zip it up in the back as it was too tight in the chest area (I am 36D). The material was not very pleasant to the touch, but the style was pretty. I have to return it."
2.0,"I can't believe this broke.  I shouldn't. Considering how inexpensive this was.  But, I was very disappointed. However, it's beautiful.  I am ordering another one. But, it's construction is very poor."
2.0,"Decent flip flops, but way too big. I’m a 7 and 1/2, ordered a 7, and had to return for a smaller size."
2.0,"I was really pleased when it came and really wanted to like it and keep it . The material seems okay but on its own , this backpack won’t stand unless you put items in it . It is not stiff enough. The hardware is of very high  quality. However the front pocket had two defects<br />1)  grey lining comes in the way of the zipper so each time you open or close , you have to carefully maneuver it so as to not let  the zip come in the way of the lining<br />2) after literally trying two times , the zipper broke as you can see in the picture . I did not even get the opportunity to use even once .<br />I received it today and will return tomorrow"
2.0,I truly love the concept of the style....BUT..the elastic in the pant turned....and i haven't wash them yet....am a seamstress so i will fit them...<br /><br />but the persons that sewing needs to slow down...the VEST i purchased had a hole in the pocket its on it way back..the dress wasn't all that<br /><br />but i can wear as a let me just run out to the store or something......am sorry the MODELS do a get job making your things look GOOD...
2.0,"I wish it was stronger, had it on my mask for not even a week and the prongs came off of it :/"
2.0,The main strap on the side has come loose and I had to get it repaired.
2.0,Only thing I didn’t like about this shirt is the sleeves are NOT fitted like they show in the picture. Very loose sleeves which I was not looking for. I wanted tight sleeves and bought this because image shows they are...
2.0,"Por el precio se juzga... las terminaciones son de mala calidad, pudo haber hecho la diferencia porque el modelo es bonito.<br />compre un 12M y le queda exacto a mi bebe de 9m."
2.0,The sweater is quite small for the size.  I can wear but cannot close in front. Glad I ordered a size larger!  Probably will not order again from this supplier!
2.0,Way too big and not supportive.
2.0,"I ordered size 9 got size 9, but it was way too small. I can’t send a video because I lost it too small to stay on my finger. I tried to wear it to the knuckle and I still lost it."
2.0,Large mens fit my wife medium. Useless for me.
2.0,I got it and the feathers were messed up and it was very bare. Did not look like the photos and I will not be able to use it because of the feathers 😞
2.0,"Dress is knitt but thin,  you would fit sure need something under it, neck hole is normal size, not large enough to accomplish the off the shoulder look as shown"
2.0,Short we're smaller than expected
2.0,It got broken the next day....poor quality
2.0,"Had snags on it, very thin"
2.0,"My boyfriend hinted about this wallet for months, so I purchased it for his birthday. It was pretty great looking and the quality felt nice, but we were disappointed to find that neither USD or CAD cash fit well in it, and he isn't the kind of guy to have a lot of cash on him at any time (we're talking only 2 or 3 bills at a time).<br /><br />He luckily had a friend visiting in town from Germany and apparently the german $ fit, because they took it off our hands."
2.0,Doesn’t have enough support to actually hold the baby therefore you have to wear a carrier under it
2.0,Looks nice but after a couple of weeks the edges and corners of the 'leather' are worn and dog-eared.
2.0,"This says it can fit up to 22.5"" and can be adjusted downward to fit smaller sizes. I wear a 22"" and this hurts, it's so small. I'm returning it and hoping the next one that says it fits up to 23"" will actually fit!"
2.0,"El llavero es bonito pero demasiado pequeño, no se alcanzan a ver los nombres y mis manos son pequeñas ya que yo solo mido 5 pies."
2.0,"Son ligeros, pero con defecto.  No pude usarlos"
2.0,Very cheaply made tie.  The quality left much to be desired. Very disappointed.
2.0,Cute but way too small. Returned
2.0,"The light on this watch is pathetic. It's so weak that when I jog at night I have to stand still in order to make out the digits, and even then I have trouble reading them. Otherwise the watch works fine, but the main reason I bought it was for night runs, so it's pretty useless to me. (In case your wondering, the light has had the same strength ever since I bought the watch, so I'm fairly certain that the problem isn't just a low battery.)"
2.0,"Very fake, band has missing stone and nothing like pictured. But I got what I paid for. HORRIBLE"
2.0,The material is kinda cheap and see through. They're smaller than expected and wouldn't buy them again.
2.0,This dress is not as soft of fabric as i would have liked.. its also very non forming. If it were higher quality the curves would follow the femine shape have a little more room and tapers to follow human body.. its more like a loose straw or tube and doesnt really hit the body in right places. Ends up appering frumpy on
2.0,Looked cheap enough that I didn't want to give as gift.  It is quite useless because it won't stay forward when worn.  It always flips backwards so your seeing the back of the flower plaque.
2.0,It is sooo large and just looks awkward.
2.0,GAVE THESE TO MY GRANDDAUGHTERS
2.0,"Crappy dress, I returned it"
2.0,"I love that the title of this dress uses the word modest! I looked like a hooker in this dress, and I'd definitely be showing off my lady parts if I had to walk up any stairs or if there was a slight breeze! I'm taller at 5'8, but I didn't expect this to be SO short! My breasts were just about hanging out of the top too, although they were covered slightly better than my lady bits. The dress was a perfect fit otherwise, so it's not as though I ordered too small."
2.0,The “dress” I received was not as pictured. The color was completely wrong and it wasn’t so much a dress as it was a slightly longer sweatshirt.
2.0,Tight has to be pulled up constantly
2.0,I bought this in blue and liked it so I bought it in a size that would fit in blue both were nice then I bought the leopard one. One sleeve hole was huge and the entire side of my bra showed and the other arm hole was normal. I didn’t wear it until December so by then it was to late to return it. I contacted the seller and got no reply.  Workmanship and quality control are lacking. The neck does lay correctly.
2.0,I purchased 3 of these to be used as gifts (to hold handmade pendants).  I saw the kinks in them but was hoping they would work anyway. All three were returned to me because the kinks did NOT come out and my friends did not know how to have them repaired. So sad.
2.0,They shrunk a lot! with the first wash. I did not dry them.
2.0,"I looks nice and fits well, however the color stained our sheet and that is very disappointing."
2.0,"I ordered the Taupe colorblock style. I washed it in a garment laundry bag on delicate, cold and laid flat to dry.  There are so many loose loops it looks terrible. There is no tag to indicate which side is the front. It is very loose fitting, and comfortable. But the quality is not good in my opinion. Unfortunately, I am unable to return it because it is past the return by date.  I tried to load a photo but there is a glitch happening with allowing access."
2.0,Seems like these run about a full size small.
2.0,Not as it appears in photos
2.0,"Everything was fine but!!!!! By behind couldnt fit and neither could my calfs. I have larger calfs. And a larger bum, they didnt fit but everything else did."
2.0,Cool and comfy. Very summery look and feel. Flattering. I love it! Recommended
2.0,"Loved everything about these leggings right when I tried them on. Thought these would be my new go too leggings, they fit perfect, not see through and loved the color. BUT, the second time wearing (still not washed) a thread came undone on the back and there was this hole from thread coming undone in the front. Was really expecting more from these, very disappointed with this purchase!"
2.0,cute but the interior is not styled well to aid with organising anything which would be essential given the narrowness of the purse.
2.0,Too clingy for my taste
2.0,"Made me look like a cardboard box, I thought the color would be cute on me. The material was not, patchy, see through, not appealing to my eye. Not as expected, but it fit my cakes nice 🐒👏🏽"
2.0,It is very pretty.  However the crystals are already falling out and the clip was messed up when it first came.
2.0,Didn't like the drape or the fabric. Not meant for women with large busts.
2.0,Card with message doesn't exist
2.0,The sweater was not well made.. the sleeves had a raw edge underneath..  not worth the money.
2.0,I thought the material would be a softer. It's pretty thick fabric
2.0,A little disappointed had threads hanging when I opened the plastic. But cute color very thin. Not a thick scarf.
2.0,"Cute and length is above knee.  Modifying my review of black & white polka dot jumper, very sloppily made.  One of the shoulder straps and one waist strap were sewn on backwards, i.e. Black solid side out vs. polka dot.  You get what you pay for (sometimes)."
2.0,These are small. I was able to use it on my son's glasses and he really likes them. They help keep glasses from sliding down his nose
2.0,Didn't have the connection to the earrings
2.0,"I normally use 0-2 size for dress and ordered Small size. It fitted somewhat large and I needed to return.<br />It looks better at the picture, the small flowers are not embroidered, they're printed. So it doesn't look so pretty."
2.0,"Product runs very small.  My child is a 10/12, and these at size 12 fit more like an 8"
2.0,I like my shirts loose. These will not be loose-fitting. Unless you size up very high.
2.0,"I originally ordered an XL set. When It arrived, I tried it on and the shirt sleeves hung down almost to my elbows. I checked the tag on both pieces and they both indicated the were indeed XL. I expected the shirt was mis-tagged.<br /><br />The shorts fit great. So, I was in a quandary.<br /><br />I contacted the seller and explained the problem.<br /><br />The seller said that there was no way to exchange the shirt as they all come in sets. He did offer me a 30% refund like that would somehow make the shirt smaller. I do not believe the seller is familiar with the American ways of doing business.<br /><br />So, I returned the set to Amazon.<br /><br />Since I really liked the set, I ordered another in a Large size this time. The shirt was much better and the shorts a little snug, but I am determined to make it work.<br /><br />I could not find the set from another seller.<br /><br />Buyer beware."
2.0,"Poor quality, terrible dye job x extremely dull color, plus it has a odd smell. I recommend you buy from a different seller, waste of money."
2.0,[[VIDEOID:c961762bab0118f485da56c09831f242]] Beautiful product but it isn’t genuine leather.
2.0,"The sunglasses were a joke.!! They were so flat, it was a joke.<br />I was worried that I would bend them, I decided to return them"
2.0,poor quality and the size runs small. It feel like it is going to break when I try it on.
2.0,"Plastic is thin, threads on the inside are absolute garbage. Threading also got stuck and now I cant unscrew and wear, so I feel I wasted money. The threading is just too thin."
2.0,"Not true to size,for a size 44 do buy 11 instead of 10:5"
2.0,Very pretty. I can’t wear them because the part that goes through the earlobe is very thick and painful.
2.0,These things ripped the first flight my husband wore them on.
2.0,it was huge and the material was very heavy and uncomfortable.
2.0,"ok, the main reason that i am writing this review is to let people know. i ordered June 21st, i didn't receive till August 1st. they are shipped from China, YES I KNOW ALL ABOUT ""OMG CHINA"" MEH. They are a good mask, they are well made that i can see, they have the ear loops, a second set of valves, the foam to attach to the underside to make it a nice air tight fit, and nose clamp so that it will work on your face. what i didn't like was before ordering being told it would be 2-4 weeks, and after ordering it would be 9 weeks. when i asked where my product was (cuz let's face it, amazon does not do tracking well when they use Yuwen to ship) i finally got to a website that said it had arrived IN the USA on July 10th.......so the USA held it up. anyway, i like the value that i got from it. and that they offer replacement filters and valves so that this is truly a re usable face mask to help with the C-19 and other things around the house as my SO is a mechanic."
2.0,These are like scrub bottoms—but shorts.
2.0,"Super brittle, both arms broke just being in my center console"
2.0,"I thought it was adorable until I realized it was missing a stone, as well as it does not open more for adjustments. Had to return."
2.0,Nice suit but way too short in torso...bought a size 8.  Had to return it.
2.0,"The colors were off, and it was made poorly"
2.0,Cheap material that doesn't breathe. Runs small/short. Hit mid-thigh on my 4' tall 7yo.
2.0,"Weird fit around the arms, the side seams don't come all the way up to your armpit, so you can't raise your arms and the chest area is super tight if you attempt to move at all. And there is a ridiculous little fabric puff at the shoulder cap. Who likes that? No one! I sew a little, and I'm going to attempt to alter the sleeves. Because it's a nice silky fabric and the keyholes are really cute. I don't understand what the big mystery is about sleeves and armholes with clothing made in Asia. They are always funky!"
2.0,love the color and 8t could've been nice if it fits
2.0,"Love the classic Marshall Tucker logo just hate the poor quality screen printing on the thin cheap cotton t shirt. Plus the logo is blurred, not crisp. I can obviously tell its been printed in a Asian country, says imported on package anyways, soooooo you can decide to buy or not."
2.0,"Although these slippers have rubber bottoms, I am on my second pair 4 months. First pair ordered on Nov. 29th 2018, the sould fell off in about a month.  The current replacement pair , has a hole in the sole by the heel already.  I wear them to the mail box occasionally  about a 30 foot walk and they should last longet than this.  I will find another source for slippers, as these just don't make the grade."
2.0,"Feels cheap, looks cheap. I regret buying it.<br /><br />For the same price you can get better ones at other stores."
2.0,Nice bag but it does not expand as much as it needs to.
2.0,CHeap
2.0,It is not what I expected. Fabric too thin pattern drawn on not embroidery.
2.0,He was a really beautiful dress
2.0,Had to return very small. Not for large kids more like for preschool age.
2.0,Pretty dress but the bust area was too tight and on small side for a medium size.  I will need to return this item.  The rest of the dress was rather fine.
2.0,because they are so thick it makes it have a little bit of optical magnification.<br />Also they are too big for what I was looking for
2.0,For really big heads. Also a couple of them started coming unsewn after the first wash.
2.0,Did not have the support  I was expecting.b
2.0,I am 5'4 160lbs. I wear a 8-10 in pants. I got the XL and still could not zip it all the way. The pants were also 3-4 inches to long on me. Over all the material is very thin but over all the item was made good. Pants were also very tight on my down there when bending over.
2.0,My daughter wa so excited to find an Among Us dress for her birthday party but unfortunately when she tried it on it was extremely short! The top fit perfect but it’s like they attached a bottom from a dress 3 sizes smaller. Really disappointed because the dress was adorable
2.0,These were ridiculously small. Easily two sizes too small. I would suggest at minimum get a complete size larger than your normal Ugg boot size. I generally buy Ugg boots in either 6 or 7 and either will work. I repurchased another slipper in a size 8 so hopefully they will work.
2.0,This cover up is nothing like the photo I returned it the same day I received it
2.0,Wonderful bra and it's gorgeous but it's WAY too small.
2.0,So cute but the dots wore off in only about a week<br />So sad.
2.0,Not good quality. It is an accurate picture but the material is much too thin and sheer.
2.0,Thin..yes with cashmere feel...but sheds horrible.  Too thin for cold weather and sheds too much to wear without continual use of a travel lint roller.
2.0,"It's ok, but pretty small. Can hardly fot my phone and keys."
2.0,"I really like these, they are very cute and dainty and perfect for what I wanted them for. However I did not receive two of the necklaces, and they were ones I was really looking forward to :(<br /><br />I’m on a big time crunch so I am still going to use the ones I did receive, but I’m still pretty disappointed I didn’t get what I paid for"
2.0,My daughter literally wore for pictures and over half  the beads have come off and it is a slim slim size. My daughter is 10% weight and she’s 7years old. The dress should fit this tight on her. I ordered a 6x.<br />I want my money back
2.0,"The initial image and description is not only misleading, but completely incorrect.  See my image - no child could wear this without bottoms, which is a basic qualification or distinction of a dress vs a shirt.  It also does not have the ruffle along the bottom.  That being said, it’s a very cute shirt, which will go with the plaid leggings I got my lady, but it is certainly not a dress."
2.0,"The watchband itself is quite nice - it is the product description which has resulted in this low rating.  The description indicates (correctly) that the watch band comes wirh 3 separate pin sizes - 16, 18 , and 20 mm) but what it doesn't state is that the band itself is 18 mm wide.  The watch I purchased this for does not accomodate a 18 mm wide band - it requires a 16 mm band.  So having a 16 mm pin didn't ensure the band would fit the watch.  In view of the cost of this band, I have simply recycled it to charity (the watchband is fine and will fit someone else's watch) as it would actually cost more to return it than to simply start over."
2.0,"I think for over twenty dollars, it looks cheap. I don't know if I'll even give it to my daughter."
2.0,"These glasses let a lot of light in around the sides, I find myself still squinting when outside. Nice that they are polarized but otherwise feel very cheaply built and not of great quality. Would not recommend buying."
2.0,"I didn't like these at all; they went back, unfortunately.  The pink sole gave them a cheap look and the fit was just sort of funky--childlike-fitting.  I have the adult pure connect and just LOVE those.  Oh well.  Very cute, probably okay for a child."
2.0,Bulky & It Doesn't Fit well so I Gave it 2 the Veterans that NEED Things!
2.0,Even the largest size available is too small for a small person.
2.0,"These earrings looked nice to begin with. But they discolored quickly and ""gems"" fell out of the mounts/settings pretty quickly. Good thing they were fairly cheap. Would not buy again."
2.0,Ran small and poor quality.
2.0,"Pretty earrings, but SUPER tiny. In the picture, there is space between the earlobe and the earring. These barely fit on my ear and I have small ears. The photo compares these sapphire earrings to the tsavorite huggies of the same price from the same seller."
2.0,"I used to find that this company had pretty solid craftsmanship of their bracelets, but as of late, the barely hold up a week with normal wear."
2.0,Bought this not thinking about having small wrists and hands so the fit does not work for me. It's extremely bulky on me. It's not the fault of the product. Tried to return it and had issues with the UPS store in my area assisting with the return. That's not the seller's fault at all. It wasn't expensive so just decided to keep the item. I'm sure I'll find someone that can use it.
2.0,"Fits larger than expected, material SO THIN! Can’t wear at the gym comfortably."
2.0,"This was my 2nd time ordering PajamaGram. I was more than pleased with last year's purchase. The quality was worth their high pricing. This order was priced $10 more and I assumed that was because they have to pay Disney, but the quality was significantly downgraded. For one there are no pockets and no waist string as there was in my previous PajamaGram purchase. So you better hope the pants fit you perfectly because there is no way to tie them in if they don't. Lucky for me the pants fit okay but the shirt is way to small. I'm sure its going to shrink too in the wash making it even smaller. The pants material is fine, however as I stated I am very disappointed no pockets or waist string. The shirt material however isn't as soft or as nice as my previous PajamaGram purchase. I would not recommend this particular pajama set by PajamaGram."
2.0,Let chain part broke in less than 3 weeks :/
2.0,Jab the inside of the nose should be more L Shapped.
2.0,For like a size medium... not at all!
2.0,"Eye pendant is not fully secured on a necklace, easy to loose"
2.0,"Disappointed in the quality.  While these shoes are cute, there is no way they are a &#34;winter boot.&#34; The shoes are not water resistant. It is not really a winter boot. The boot material is pretty cheap. A shoe like this should only cost $12 bucks at Payless. Ok shoe if you don't care about quality and are looking for style/trend."
2.0,This skirt runs really small.
2.0,"The dress itself is cute.  I ordered a size up, and the waist still went across my bust.  I sent it back."
2.0,"Great support, but really tight around calf."
2.0,The fabric was too thin and clingy  for me so this item was returned.
2.0,It tore within the first 4 times of wearing it.
2.0,"It has been difficult to return the item.  The dress is beautiful.  The company says I don’t have to pay for the return, but the return label they send makes you pay for shipping it back to them.  I am really hoping they send me a different label."
2.0,It hangs straighter than in the picture.  It's not as unique as I had hoped for.
2.0,Wore these once to go whitewater rafting. Wore them under water shoes so very little impact with water and no direct impact with ground yet I had a hole along the seam by the end of the day.
2.0,I’ve had these bras for a few months now. They fit as expected and I love the colors! They were comfortable but now the underwire is coming out of all of them and poking me in the side. I guess it’s to be expected with the low price.
2.0,"The dislike of this blouse is absolutely, 100% my opinion - the model seems to pull it off, but on me...Minnie Mouse :/  The sleeves puff up and out,  I thought the color was red, but it is more of an orange-red, anyway, not to my liking and sadly enough, I will be creating my Halloween costume from it. Thank goodness the blouse was reasonably priced. (Oh, the blouse is well made - just cartoonish)"
2.0,Very sheer with obvious seems across cups. Band is CRAZY tight and small. Cups are very wideset.
2.0,"I got the small, it was too tight ( I'm a size 6) so ended up returning it.  The belt itself looked good, the brown was much lighter than pictured."
2.0,I didn’t like the material.  The pockets stuck out like I had large softballs in the sides.  I ordered a size up so maybe that was why.  The skirt did not arrive pleated as portrayed in the photo either. I ended up returning it.
2.0,Pants are long enough but elsastic is too tight. I’ve been trying to stretch them out/break the elastic so they are more comfortable.
2.0,soft and comfy. However they get fuzzy balls all over after wash.
2.0,"It’s not made for full size woman with curves, ONLY for a regular size woman."
2.0,Runs large. Cheaply made. returned and wouldn’t purchase again
2.0,"This review is for a COMFELIE Seamless Bra for Women Wireless Comfort Bra in the color biege. It is made of 51% nylon and 49% spandex, and has no underwire. I am a 42DD so following their size chart I ordered 3XL. I've never ordered that size in anything before, but I thought it best to follow their chart. It fits odd. The band around the back fits ok, but the straps feel stiff and are wider than I thought. The cups make me look like I'm wearing a minimizer. Where the under arms meet the cup, the fabric sticks out away from the skin in a way that is noticeable through clothes. Unfortunately I won't be able to wear this bra."
2.0,"It was too small,size should be available to choose from"
2.0,"Nice color, but stiff, not comfortable"
2.0,"Item is smaller than expected given the measurements given (we ordered larger than stated already).  As many others have mentioned, the boots are hard to put on, the opening does not give very much.  The actual shoe is also not as nice as picture/model shows and the lining sheds... Returned."
2.0,I very disappointed because I was excited about the beautiful colors and style. When they arrived in immediately tried to put one in but because they are WAY TO SMALL I can't wear them. I wasted my money. I should have stayed with the L shaped studs. :(
2.0,Very odd and uncomfortable fit. Returned. It does the opposite of slim and also somewhat short in the torso. I would not suggest if you are tall.
2.0,Top is amazing but bottoms are completely see through and thin.  You can see every aspect of the female anatomy.  So disappointed.
2.0,"The top was too small, cute and nice fabric."
2.0,It was very loose when I brought it and within 3-4 days one of the string popped
2.0,I bought this for my nephew but the material was very very cheap for the price. Thankfully he used it only once!
2.0,"Poor design. There is a lining, padding, and I guess an attached cleaning cloth inside the case. After way too many times of the material getting caught in the zipper I couldn't fix it anymore and threw it away."
2.0,The band is too long if you need to use the last few holes and excess hangs loose.
2.0,"If you get glover works get the higher priced industrial ones ones, these are okay but tear easily and tear just putting them on."
2.0,Got this for a gift. It arrived with the the clasp broken. It’s a cute charm bracelet but now I’m torn weather to even give it as a gift because it’s not able to clasp together. And it’s too late to find something else. Disappointed.
2.0,I do not recommend these glasses.  They are extremely loose fitting to the point of falling off if you look down.  There is no way to adjust the glasses and glassesare useless to me.  Too much trouble to return.
2.0,"My fault for not paying better attention to the pictures, but they are much smaller than I expected. I got the Boba Fett earrings several years ago, and figured the Kylo Ren would be the same size.<br /><br />Reality: Lucasfilms vs. Disney"
2.0,Still deciding if I should return it.
2.0,"Super cute for True Sailor moon fans, but i did only get to use this one day. They started breaking a couple mins after putting them on. I only gave it 2 stars because overall they are really cute. They look like thigh high boots. Unfortunately I wouldn’t purchase again or suggest it to anyone."
2.0,"The colors are lovely, the size is generous, but the name,""Beads of Strength"" is somewhat of a misnomer.  Sure the colors are sparkley and pretty to look at (and they're all there on the one strand) but within 2 hrs of wearing the braclet, the clasp broke, the bracelet falling to the floor. All the beads stayed together, just a bad clasp.  Thankfully, I have a jewelry repair kit for just kind of this thing. I would rather the description have more details on the materials; ie: ""plastic clasp, glass beads, poly line"" .... something like that. But i'm still happy to have purchased somehting that helped the crafter make a living."
2.0,"These sweatpants are like capris! I’m 5’6” so a little on the tall side, but nothing extreme! Really a bummer!"
2.0,"Smaller then expected, more for a child"
2.0,SO BIG. thought it was going to be a smallll tiny hoop for your cartilage... NO. they could be hoops. sucks I lost 15$ for this and I was so excited.
2.0,Very small. The closures do not open on all.
2.0,blue color of suit had bled onto the pink.  Very poorly made.
2.0,I bought this product for a friends Christmas gift.  It's extremely smaller than I thought it would be for the price.  The logo is almost unrecognizable ... if you don't know LSU colors you'd try to figure out what it is.
2.0,"While this is very pretty, it looks cheap close-up. The &#34;turquoise&#34; beads do not seem to be cut from real turquoise stones. At best, they might be powder composite reformed to look like turquoise. They look very cheap/fake. The findings are attractive, but I haven't had the necklace long enough to know how well they will hold up."
2.0,These hurt my nose when putting it in at the bend
2.0,Way too tight. I'm 6'1&#34; 175 lbs muscular build and the medium was too small.
2.0,"Super cute but cut way too small, I had to send it back."
2.0,breaks really easily. broke twice while wearing. broke because i took off my shirt. thinner than originally thought.
2.0,"Ordered for winter, haven't worn them"
2.0,"I bought 3 of these. They are beautifull colors and soooo soft. But order at least 2 sizes larger than you want. I wear them open so it wasn't that big of a deal, but they really look too small even when worn open. But I have lost 37# this past year and plan on losing another 18 this year.  I am holding them until they fit. LOL"
2.0,This was my 3rd order of these socks and will be my last.  I really like the socks.  They fit well and are comfortable.  But 4 socks of the 6 pairs developed holes in the heels in a few weeks.  I expect socks to last longer.  These unfortunately are not satisfactory and I will not order more.
2.0,The product works poorly
2.0,"Dress is cute.  Ordered a large, hahaha! Hardly fits my 100 pound Mom, it not only runs small but borderline tiny!"
2.0,This looks nothing like the photo. I'm very disappointed
2.0,"I was surprised to see how hard it was,  it was like a suitcase and award to carry."
2.0,This dress looks more like a nightgown than something that can be worn in public.
2.0,The fit around the ankle is very strange it just isn't comfortable. They are cute and fit fine but for some reason the cut around the ankle makes them uncomfortable. Hoping they will stretch out. Also worth noting there is not tread on the bottom so they are very slippery on tile floor
2.0,"I purchased this bra, and was unable to close the band. I wear a 40C"
2.0,The diamonds keep falling out but for the price they serve their purpose
2.0,The seam at the shoulder has come apart and is not an easy fix.
2.0,"So the color is very pretty, but comfort level is very questionable. I put them on under the premise that the fluff would be comfortable. Instead, I found that the sole is very firm. The shoes certainly warm up your feet, though. In fact, there’s a great likelihood that your feet will sweat. If you like firm slippers with a tiny bit of comfort, these will work. If you want to feel as though you are walking on a cloud, keep looking. These are earth-bound house shoes."
2.0,"The sleeves are too wide and the applique is too heavy on the sleeves. It makes a nice sleep dress, though. Not my favorite garment, for sure."
2.0,"I never remove my toe rings because I have larger toes and it tends to weaken them. The design of this leaves it more weak than other items and it caught on the bath drain and snapped in half. It was comfortable though and for someone smaller, would probably last longer."
2.0,I thought this was too big for my small face even though I bought an adult small<br />It was also irritating me on my chin where the seam is created<br />Not worth the price
2.0,Is perf ct the n top but too big on hips.
2.0,"Good quality but had to return this item.  Please beware that this item's sizing runs smaller than you would expect.  Typically can buy or order anything in the size my husband wears and never have to try them on.  Ordered his size and he could barely get them on, definitely could not get them zipped or buttoned (not even close).  Good fabric and construction, but  sizing is WAY OFF."
2.0,"On the back of the dress, the appliqués are dislocated.<br />The cuff is too small and hurts the girl's shoulder.  And to repair the dress, it has to disarm on the top and the seams would be out.<br />The cut of the tulle has a peak on one of its sides, when having to match it, the bottom lining of the dress must be cut too."
2.0,"The clip seems heavy duty, but was too tight to use even after a week of stretching on a billfold. It is a small clip, which I was fine with, but the &#34;skull&#34; design looks more like an alien."
2.0,Bad material and it does not fit even following the size chart. I would size 4 sizes up from what you normally wear.
2.0,"Not what I expected. Material is like a rough rayon feel, but thin and cheap. I normally wear a size L or 12 pants, but these were still loose. Didn't seem stretch. Pant cuff wasn't not skinny tapered and also it's folded with a sewn on brand tag to it."
2.0,This is a nice dress nice material but has little or no stretch at all and the area that covers your breast is very small
2.0,"The fingers are too long. They are warm and soft. I wish tge finders weren't so long, it difficult to grab anything with them on."
2.0,"I like the shorts and the material. Unfortunately, the sizes are way off. Ordered a 2XL. What I got says 2XL but it’s actually maybe a L, at most."
2.0,"felt flimsy, cheap and did not seat well on my face - crooked. Had to return it but the lenses were stylish."
2.0,"To pay $16 for a watch band when the entire watch sells for $33 is completely ridiculous.<br />  Secondly, these replacement watch bands split after about a year. I have now gone through the original and 1 replacement band. I found a great looking leather and canvas replacement band on AliBaba’s Aliexpress app for $7 when I ordered 2 including tax and shipping and used a $2 coupon.  The price lists at four dollars and change plus shipping and tax. I think I could get one for six dollars with the two dollar discount. I’ll let you know how shipping goes but it had decent reviews."
2.0,"Fit well but completely see through, might as well not wear pants"
2.0,"Better be a ""thin man"" or similar to wear these and not worried about then riding too low on the backside! LOL"
2.0,I like the sunglasses that come in this set. The glasses are good for the price but frames are pretty flimsy.  Broke one pair already.  Just have to be careful with them.
2.0,The quality was great. I wish that I had received what I ordered
2.0,"The moment I spotted the word cashmere in the title, I immediately ordered it. I don’t think I’ve ever had anything made with cashmere before as the material is more synonymous with the upper crust. However, I always imagined that it must be so luxurious soft that only the wealthy felt it should be privileged to. So when I received the Jeff & Aimy wool blend cashmere feel winter scarf I was obviously left confused. This is the worst feeling scarf ever, feels horrendous and almost borderline hazardous to the delicate skin that belongs to the face, that’s how rough it is. When you think of scarves and where one mainly wears a scarf, you think of a silky, warm, smooth, gentle, & uber soft fabric that makes you want to wrap it around your neck and bury your face in it. However this scarf feels like a rough outdoor mat, the ones that are weatherproof, so they’re extremely rough to the touch. I shudder at the description where it states that this scarf is not scratchy & is skin friendly. It’s the most opposite skin friendly scarf ever. The color is a lighter burgundy than the one in the description photo. Material is made of 30% Wool & 70% Acrylic, size approximately 71"" x 23"" with fringe on each side. The size is generous making it versatile to wear, you can use it as a hood scarf, fashion scarf or winter scarf. However, since this would mainly be near my face and others faces, if you have sensitive skin, I would not recommend it."
2.0,"Based on previous reviews, I was hoping this dress would be amazing, but it really wasn’t.  I have gained weight recently, but this dress made me look much heavier than I am.  I was self conscious all day bcuz I felt HUGE!  Couldn’t wait to get back to the hotel and take it off."
2.0,I’m a 4/6 and bought a medium. It fit great but the smocked elastic part almost came down too far. It wasn’t all the way to the waist but further down than you’d expect. Returned because I wasn’t in love with it.
2.0,"This top is shorter than on model and I am only 5'2"". Top is loose in underarms and not so in midsection. Fabric is clingy and not that regular type used in athletic clothes.<br />Returned with no problem."
2.0,"Product appears to be questionably made, arrived with the mesh lining pulled away at the sewn seam. I guess you get what you pay for,  but I'm sure the manufacturer would not be happy with this problem."
2.0,They fit as expected. They are to thin almost see through and to long dragging on the floor and I’m 5’6
2.0,"Buying these was thinking true to size because guess what ,it stated true to size. Nope you need to buy a size bigger. And i could tell it was made over seas because the tag was in the front of the underwear instead of the back where its supposed to be. Manufacture error"
2.0,"Wrong color, don't stay on.."
2.0,One of the umbrellas stopped opening properly during the second use. The other stopped on the fourth. The last one still works. They have not been back in the plastic containers once. It's too much of a pain. I gave them two stars for excellent sun blocking and they were better than a poncho in Disney World. Marginally.
2.0,"Please note: This item ships from Hong Kong (hence the long shipping time) even though it says &#34;made in USA&#34; Very misleading. I ordered this wire on June 8th and I received it on June 25th. Now, I know that the price is right so I knew not to expect much but I had to let others know. This wire has a &#34;plastic&#34; feel to it and I question whether it is gold filled or not. If you are looking for a high grade gold filled wire, I would look elsewhere and pay the little extra."
2.0,Earpieces broke after a few days of wear!
2.0,I bought a medium size but it was way too tight for me. And lengthwise also it’s pretty short. So returned. But the velvet material is really soft and nice.
2.0,Hated the fabric. I was expecting something softer. I don’t know who weaves this type of fabric as a long dress.
2.0,Band fits poorly tool for removing is very flimsy huge gap between band and watch very disappointed with this product
2.0,Poor quality<br />Really cheap looking<br />Would not recommend for quality<br />If you really want a watermelon look<br />It’s for you
2.0,"Will not buy them again.  The waist is too large and has no elastic inside, so I have to constantly pull them up."
2.0,"Like how many pockets I have, ok color, like light weight.<br />Very frustrating zipper that didn't close smoothly. Will NOT recommend anyone this bag."
2.0,Some of the sequins along the edge point in and scratch your face
2.0,"Loved the way they fit from the front, but the back pleating is super weird. I tried them on, then my roommate, then a friend and all three of us had the same issue. Such a bummer!"
2.0,The material was nice but a 36 fit like a 32. The opening for the button was closed and had to use a knife to open it.
2.0,"I loved the color and the style, but it was too small.  I ordered a large, and I normally wear a medium.  I had to return it."
2.0,It was too big and heavy for my keyfob. Although the material wasn't bad and would have kept it if it wasn't larger than my keyfob.
2.0,Really small in circumference although husband likes them... picture appears as though they are bigger on site
2.0,"I like the design and the appearance of the item,however, the quality were very poor, the metal material in the connection is easily to get rusted and the paint faded away some black material come out which I did not figure."
2.0,"I'm a huge fan of any boho palazzo pants but these are not for you if your in the shorter spectrum. I'm 5'1 and they are so long. Also, the material feels like what your hair dresser puts around your neck before they cut your hair. I haven't washed them yet but just wearing them outside, they are not breathable. Sorry bu I wouldn't recommend these."
2.0,"I bought this ""dress"" to go to church. It was way too short and the material is see through. Very inappropriate for church. Im keeping it though because if I wear a tank top and pants/ jeans I can wear it for date night as a shirt."
2.0,Poorly made and the threading is all coming off.. way overpriced for such poor quality.
2.0,"Both boots are labeled as the same size, but one fits and the other is about an inch too small. They also came in the wrong color. I tried to return, but by the time I pay for return shipping and initial shipping is deducted from my refund, I would lose more money. It's a shame because they're actually really cute."
2.0,the product was extremely small
2.0,"Initially, I thought these looked nice, fit OK (a little loose) and were well-made. After light wear around the house for 3 weeks, however, the seam started pulling away from the sole and now they look not so hot. I reiterate, they fit slightly loose so there is no way my foot was responsible for this bursting seam. I would love to return them, but they were a gift purchased before Christmas and I'm sure I cannot return them now. I am guessing they'll end up in the trash within the month."
2.0,They look good but for a bit too small
2.0,i am 5'5&#34; and it was too short to even wear with flip flops
2.0,Weird fit and see through.  Normally fit into a S or M but I read that it runs small so I ordered an XL.  The XL fits but the shoulders have a weird cut to them.  Cheap item and not surprised by the quality.
2.0,Not exactly what I was looking for.<br />Seller refunded me.<br />Watch never kept time .<br />Looked nice. But never worked.
2.0,Didn't realize at the time. But doesn't give a size and it came as a small. Didn't even come close to fitting. But good material.
2.0,I ordered a 3X and it's more like an extra large. Very disappointed.
2.0,"While this coat is warm and comfortable, I’ve only worn this coat a handful of times since I got it a few weeks ago and the zipper keeps breaking. It’s really disappointing since it’s the only issue I have with the coat. Based on my experience, I would not recommend buying this coat."
2.0,"I got it on time. It looked great and brand new. One week of having it and the battery, screen, and digital functions cease to work. That frustrates me that the seller gave me a faulty battery or bad watch  Good price point. Irritated with behind the scene issues."
2.0,"No idea why it was designed this way.  The back is nice looking and then the front has writing on it, 100% reversed to what it should be.  Baffled why it was designed this way as are other customers."
2.0,"The makers should learn more about sizes, those items are not well made at all"
2.0,Too loose. They kept falling down.
2.0,I preferred dark gray and received black with no belt.
2.0,"This is a very nice riding jacket but the sizing is way off for U.S. buyers. I used the chart and had help measuring for the correct size and then added one size larger just to be safe. My thought process didn’t work, should have been 2 sizes. I ordered Large and I’m 5’10 and 163 lbs. it’s going back."
2.0,Pretty tight even on my 9 year old son<br />Cute but needs to be bigger
2.0,"not for petite girls, has an awkward and unflattering fit. It's like tooooo high waisted if you have a short torso and doesn't do much for your butt cause its too loose in that area + makes stomach bulge out a little"
2.0,"The quality is fine, but I always struggle when looking for a bathing suit due to adequate support.  I am a 38G.  The breast area buckled weirdly.  I never felt I had the support to feel confident.  But more importantly, it fit weird in that area, like it was trying to overlap.  It did not keep my breasts separated, just mushed them together."
2.0,I am 5’10 and this dress was so short I couldn’t even get away with wearing tights to conceal the fact that it was short
2.0,They are alright. But the lip on the edge is way too big it leaves a flap that hangs over too far.
2.0,"If you were expecting this to be a true white color they are not they are a ivory extremely light beige color. Overall the socks feel comfortable I had no tear in them. But I wish they were white as they described...because I wanted white socks, not ivory light beige socks."
2.0,"Ordered a size larger than what i am because other reviews said it ran small. Its tight. But comfortable. Except my &#34;package&#34; is very, very, clearly visible. I dont think I'll ever wear these in public but i think they will make cozy underwear?"
2.0,"This is a lovely dress but VERY short waisted. There is no way someone with normal to large breasts can wear this without looking like a giant panda. The waistline rides up to your bra line, loses all definition, and makes your waist look boxy and thick. I hated to but I HAD to return it!!!"
2.0,"Very attractive and fits well.  However, I have never worn this one as I bought 2, a black and a white one.  The black one was damaged beyond repair on 2nd usage.  The problem is the lace is too fine and shredded because just pulling up created a 'tear'."
2.0,The fabric is thinner than I had hoped and the fit is on the tight side although it works.  Will be nice to pack for vaca since it isn’t at all bulky but I don’t see this lasting very long.
2.0,looks better in picures.
2.0,"This belt looked nice but after the 4th time, the white starts peeling and stripping away. It fits nicely, and the price was not extremely high but I would have liked a belt I could wear for a while without it deteriorating."
2.0,"Pro: Color and pattern as advertised,  Material is very soft and stretchy<br />Con: huge... I'm a postcovid size 8 and bought a M,  too long and  flares out too wide,  unfinished and uneven laser cut edges on sleeves. Image looks like top is waffle knit.... it's not"
2.0,"First of all, I love kino body and Greg’s programs. But that said this belt lasted 3 months and the clip snapped. Also it had come undone a few times. Not cool... I liked the belt when it worked that’s why I give 2 stars not 1. This is a design flaw. Would like to return or exchange belt but window has closed."
2.0,Runs way small and they are very long
2.0,Wouldn’t stay up on the ankles and didn’t sit flat or comfortably on the toes.
2.0,"Very cheaply made. Was folded in such a way that decal was glued to itself and peeling off in areas. Cute idea, poor quality."
2.0,"Way to big for kids (12 and down), even by adjusting the elastics they are to big."
2.0,"Was very careful packing this hat for a vacation, there was a little rain and it lost it's shape. Would not recommend. Just bought a San Diego Hat and much better for a good price too."
2.0,I had to return it because it was too small.  the coat is very nice and I wish it came in real US sizes.
2.0,I went off the the size chart but it was too tight and it was the largest size available. Beautiful fabric though!
2.0,The necklace gets tangled very easily
2.0,"Many reviewers, I noticed, gave 4 stars and up despite everyone agreeing that these run wide. Well, I for one consider them nearly unusable for that purpose. If it were only slightly larger size, then I would happily give it 4 stars and warn others - we could just wait for the kid to start wearing them next year when he grows a little.<br /><br />But this are both big, AND wide! His small toddler feet could never fit snugly into them! If they are meant for ""heavier"" children, then that is fine, but it should say so and I would know not to waste money on it! (in the theoretical case that I was a paying customer).<br /><br />It's made of fine material, and laceless makes it perfect for toddlers. But they are practically unusable because of their being overly wide."
2.0,"The fabric is cheap, easily fade. Its not good matte. I wouldn't recommend!"
2.0,"Knight hoodie, ordered mint, got aqua, Return?...spots on collar/hood by the laces.  Outside of that, the softness is wonderfully there.  The 2 stars are for the softness only.  You make this very disappointing to not like.  This is another product through Amazon that fails on delivery to be quality or clean.  It's a simple hoodie, nothing complicated.  Try keeping product clean and send the color we order.  That's another false advertisement on the coloring. It was a gift but will not be able to gift it because of the color - aqua is very One Note and limited for pairing, they don't want aqua, or I would have ordered aqua.  Hope you feel good about yourselves at Blank Knight/Knight Apparel and Amazon about sending out false advertisement on color. Have a great day."
2.0,Thought it would be different
2.0,Very rough material. Doesnt bend well and scratches at my wrist leaving it red.
2.0,"This was supposed to be a package of 12. I received 11. Also, 2 or 3 were so badly bent they would need to be repaired before they could be used. Disappointed."
2.0,runs way to big
2.0,I got a pair of plnk ones for Christmas and I loved them.  I ordered two more and they were much smaller even though I bought an extra large these fi like a medium and I had to send them back.  I ordered two more pair and they are also too small about a large so they are tight.  I’m going to keep those because I don’t feel like messing with them anymore.  I will give them to my daughter who ironically bought the first pair. I don’t know who makes them for you but I wouldn’t buy them again.
2.0,I liked the material and quality of the pajamas.
2.0,"The material is cotton, as described.  But the &#34;dress&#34; fits like a shirt.  The model must be pretty short, because it only comes part way down the thigh, not nearly near the knee, like in the picture."
2.0,"I ordered this brown, but I received a green one. What the hell!"
2.0,Not great honestly. Hot glued together poorly. I had to take time out of my wedding day to put them back together more that Once.
2.0,"My daughter loves dresses but I’m sick of pink everything for girls so I was excited to see this one with a more neutral pattern and colors, but sadly when I went to have her try it on, I realized the skirt is completely see-through. The lining is a super cheap, thin, almost transparent material. In addition to being see-through, it also feels like it wouldn’t last more than a wash or two before starting to fall apart. This one is an immediate return."
2.0,Although I read the reviews and ordered a size up it was still too small in the top.  I returned it. The material was nice and it was a very pretty dress.
2.0,"It was pretty small and tight on me. I can still wear it, but only on certain occasions."
2.0,The white has a yellow cast to it which made it look dingy.
2.0,"Quality is good, but I couldn't use it all day at work, my nose and ears was hurting because mask were to small and couldn't stretch it no more."
2.0,Girlfriend and her mom laughed at them. Bad gift idea.
2.0,I normally wear a large but ordered the extra large and it was way too small in the chest area
2.0,This shirt runs very small. My husband normally wears an XL so that is what I orders and it is so tight in the shoulders and arms. The color and design is nice and the fabric feels nice on the skin. It's a shame it is too small because it did look nice on him.
2.0,"It is very large, made to fit a vast diversity and types of bodies,  it very stretchy, so it is also bulky. Very pretty print though..."
2.0,I like the style .I don't like the way they fit on my face .I didn't realize thay were by focal
2.0,"Bummed. I ordered a L (I’m a 36D), in green & Gray. Loved them. So, ordered the black in L.  But… obviously a M (I compared to my daughter’s M I got her in green), even though label says L. I dunno if sizing is off for just Black, or all 3 are different, now."
2.0,"The 'NAVY BLUE"" color I ordered arrived as dark green and nothing like the color shown in the advertisment."
2.0,I  bought this for my husband.  It is too small for a man.  I though it looked shinny on line but it was so great when I got it in.  It might look better on a woman.
2.0,"I had high hopes for these gloves but the other reviews have it right. 5.11 makes great products, but this one missed the mark. The seams are in odd places making them uncomfortable. The fingers are short and makes my hand squished while rest of glove fits great. These are super rigid with absolutely zero dexterity. Impossible to shoot while wearing. These aren't the worst but I certainly won't wear these on a daily basis."
2.0,Runs way to small. I unfortunately had to return. Its so short I could wear it out. I'm 5'8 and wear a size M. 135 lbs. maybe if u are shorter it would work but definitely not a 5'8
2.0,The pockets were sew together and it wud be ok if I was left handed ( backwards)
2.0,The outfit does not look or fit as shoen in the picture. it says to order a size larger but the bottoms fit waaaaayyy to big..im sending it back for a smaller size. Overall its a Cute Outfit
2.0,Love the sparkle but looks like copper not rose gold.
2.0,Can't set the time keeps flashing
2.0,"I love that they gave me a hole punch in case I want to alter the size.  Don't let the strange sizing info in the listing scare you. I am waist size 31 and it fits great. Only people with waist size 36 or more should seek a different option.<br />Seller wrote to tell me I could cut the belt smaller if needed which I thought was strange for a high quality leather belt.  Well, that brings me to my low rating.  The reason one can cut the belt shorter if desired is because it is not leather!  It's obvious immediately because of the plastic-looking shine and the absence of any grain.  The material is quite supple for synthetic and I would guess it is a new and improved material but, if you want leather or the look of leather, keep looking."
2.0,"Ordered Black got Navy. Might keep it. Not sure. Material is thick and Dress looks good.<br />S fits as expected. I'm 5'3"" and 130-135 pounds. 34C-28-38"
2.0,"I'm not impressed with this wig.<br />I purchased it as a Vanellope Von Sweets cosutme wig but couldn't get the wig to sit correctly because the weight was at the nape instead of crown.<br />This wig was also much larger than any wig I've purchased before. Even after adjusting it to its smallest size it was too big and bunched up and gaped away from my neck and temples.<br />Otherwise the wig hair is nice, supple, and easily managed."
2.0,"These seem sturdy enough, but they are more for a child.  My face is small, but they are still too small for me."
2.0,"Don't care for the material, but I still kept it."
2.0,UGH
2.0,"The dress came apart on the first wear. Now it's in a corner. Love the material, but poor make."
2.0,Way too big. Very think plastic like material.
2.0,"I'm 5'7 and 107 lbs and it was to baggy on me, sadly. I wish it came in a xs. Length wise it was perfect but for my torso it's just to loose."
2.0,"It was shiny and pretty when it showed up, but at 4-1/2 months old the only good thing I can say is it hasn't broke. The lovely shiny white gold plating is nearly all worn off. This has not been used in any pool or ocean water."
2.0,Good quality but smaller than advertised. Keeps coming down by the heel and under my foot.
2.0,"I ordered three of these freshwater pearl bracelets in 7 in length, hoping to wear them together for a Art Deco look.  When they arrived, one was 8.5 inches and the other two were 7.5 inches each.  All three were comically large on my 5.75"" wrists!  The Pearls which were supposed to be 7-8mm were in fact 8-9mm — that wasn't a big deal for me as I purchased them to compliment an 8-9mm pearl rope.  The pearls were not entirely round, but largely unblemished, while having that uniqueness to each pearl that makes real freshwater pearls so special, and sized well to each other.  I contacted the seller to see if it was possible to purchase three bracelets that are exactly 7 inches in length and never heard back — terrible customer service.  Return was very easy, but I would have preferred three 7 inch bracelets to wear."
2.0,The frames should be silver since they are mirrored but the frames are gold throws the whole thing off.
2.0,"Wasn't comfy, had a weird feeling did not like"
2.0,The shoelaces do not stayed tied.
2.0,These don't fasten securely. It came undone and got lost at the airport.
2.0,"It's not as dark yellow as pictured, more dandelion colored than mustard, and sash isn't shiny like is pictured. Flattering with bow added, does not stretch and it is not sheer. 3/5 overall"
2.0,"The charm part is super cute but the chain was awful and was in a knot when I got it, it couldn't be salvaged and now the charm is ruined too as it won't fit on my own chain and the circle connector is compromised.  Very disappointed."
2.0,Shorttt
2.0,Not a great watch band
2.0,fit is wide and weird
2.0,Well I guess you get what you pay for. Masks were all different fits. Very cheaply made. Do not recommend.
2.0,"Very large and different from the picture, material appears to be good, but I’m very disappointed."
2.0,"I personally did not like the look of this ring because of the black color of it instead of silver, but if you are looking for an inexpensive ring, it is worth it."
2.0,Gave character to my ID badge and went with everything I wore but it eventually broke
2.0,Super cute but super cheap. You get what you pay for :) snapped after wearing it once
2.0,"Product broke after 1 week of use.  More specifically, the inside and main zipper broke.  Real bummer."
2.0,They are pretty but made of light thread material. They lose their shape after the first wear.
2.0,"I bought the gray and the black, grey fit, black did not.  Way too tight in the arms, had to give it to my girlfriend."
2.0,These run really big.  I bought them to use for working out and hiking. They are fine for this.  I should have returned them and gotten a size smaller.<br />Size down.
2.0,"Way too small, the top is not at all like what is pictured.  More like a tiny spandex sports bra but where your boobs fall out and there's no support"
2.0,Sucks you in.. Leaves you with back bulges and the zipper is not easy to hide under form fitting outfits.. Won't buy another one.
2.0,The jacket for ok sleeves were a little short. The pants have no stretch to them on the waste . If you have a bigger butt get an even bigger size. I usually wear small however I ordered medium and to my surprise was super hard to get on because I was determined to wear it I finally squeezed my ham loafs into this and now I Look like a pink sausage.<br /> The material is very thin however what did I expect for 20 bucks . It’ll do the job after I drop a few pounds and I’m really hoping they will fit. Got two weeks .
2.0,Starting with the good - design and bells of the Shiny Reindeer was cute - BUT very thin material and seemed stretched out almost like a VERY old sweater gets in the neck and sleeves. Will include a photo if that helps. I ordered in both black and red but both had the same issue. Large seemed almost too large and I would typically go size 12-14 for a loose top.
2.0,"Wiggly, they don't stay in place"
2.0,"The sleeve and hood material starts to ball up pretty fast, like within 2 months. The jacket is not so tough. The lining is a bit weak too, because it easily rips. It's an o.k. jacket. It's better looking than it really is."
2.0,It arrived with some mars and damage on it that were not disclosed at the time of sale. Very dissapointed!! It was my first expensive purse and i worked long and hard to get the money and it was less than perfect!
2.0,You get what you pay for. Not a good watch band.
2.0,"It’s hard to tell from the picture but this is a 3 piece swimsuit, which isn’t what bothered me....what did bother me was the white top underneath the tank is a tiny little tube top, so there was zero support and nothing to keep it up. I barely had it on for 5 mins just walking around before it started sliding down. So bummed this didn’t work out...I did love the colors!"
2.0,"Low quality material, did not last very long. I would probably go with a different brand next time."
2.0,Very nice... but much smaller than expected.
2.0,The necklace pieces had sharp edges and would catch on sweaters and knit shirts.
2.0,"There's no clasp; it's one long strand that you loop over your wrist and it holds together with light magnetics. It would be fine, and my wife liked how it looks, but the magnets are too weak to hold it together and it was constantly unraveling and overlapping on itself. Had to return it."
2.0,Very very tight more for people who are size 4.11inches and small like an Asian woman not good for women with tone or built bodies.
2.0,Very cheap. Ill fitting
2.0,I only wore the bracelet once and the string became detached from the clip.  Did like the charms and wound up using them on the new found bracelets with the rubber bands.  Works well with those.  Am looking for a color rope to make my own bracelet.  To much energy and time to send back.
2.0,"The sunglasses were super adorable and the perfect size and very lightweight. Unfortunately, they are cheaply made, after a month of use the lens started popping out of the frame and it can't be pushed back in. I ordered two of these and it happened to each of them, I guess you get what you pay for."
2.0,The case peels within 2 days of having it.
2.0,"I got this for my father, who has dementia, to give to my mother for her 81st birthday. Though a heavy metal necklace, it is crudely made and of low quality. Even knowing what is stamped on the little heart, I can't read it!"
2.0,"The pattern & color are amazing, even VIBRANT! But, the clasps are cheap plastic & can be a pain in the neck to operate. (The catch/release mechanism is tricky/sticky) On top of that, the clasp placement is awkward as well. Whereas it's usually front-left for easy access, you have to turn their ties halfway around your head unless you're a Master Contortionist. (Or Mr. Stretch)"
2.0,Very disappointed because the shorts are actually Off White and not described as White.
2.0,"This product would be great, BUT. It’s a great size, has a zippered compartment, and has many little sleeves for various items. I only needed it to hold 2 keys and it slowly tore apart over 2 months. First the metal lanyard attachment popped off and then, after having to use the hole it left to attach the lanyard, the fabric itself tore open. It’s been a letdown. Going to have to try something else!"
2.0,"Very, ver**y small, don't buy that**"
2.0,These socks are very lose at the opening/brim. It almost looks as if it is stretched
2.0,Runs a little small but fits just okay.
2.0,"These are cute, but too big and they don't stay on the barbell"
2.0,"I don't recommend these and I still can't find a good pair of faux leather leggings.  I let these air out for a week and they still stunk like weird cleaning chemicals, and they weren't a super snug fit.  I want them to look almost painted on honestly, but these weren't stretchy enough for that and ended up looking a little weird.  Not very comfortable either.  Pass on these and please let me know if you find some good relatively inexpensive faux leather leggings here on Amazon!"
2.0,"Love the simplicity and the design. Unfortunately this is my second one in two months. The screen cracked on both of them, fogged up and then stopped working. I do use it at work and I do manual labor. I really thought it would hold up better."
2.0,Nice shoe but too narrow and tight for a size 1.5 or 2.
2.0,"The clasp is very hard to operate if you have a man sized wrist. The leather pealed on the edge during normal wear.  It didn’t have that worn leather look, it looked cheap.  It did look nice coming out of the box and came in impressive packaging."
2.0,"The yellow is very pretty and as shown. However, the proportions aren't right, and they are very big and very long, so they don't look good, at least on me. I gave mine away."
2.0,No pockets. I would have probably rated this a five or at least a four if the jacket had pockets. Pockets are important. Pockets.
2.0,"IM 4’10 and a little on the heavier side and his fit me mid shin. The materials was cheaper than I expected and the other reviews were right, it looks like an old Sunday dress. I wanted to give it a try. Also the seam opening felt awkward for me it should have been more to the side not so much in the front?? Just my opinion"
2.0,No two of these fit the same. I had picked up some xoxo bras at TJ maxx and love them. Bought the same size here...  These are variously too small.
2.0,"This was such a cute outfit.....but it runs very small. In the end I had to buy different pants and made the rest of the out do as is... The pants was the main problem, I ordered a 4T and it was more like a 2t-3t"
2.0,There were several areas in the wig that were much thinner than the rest.  Plucked too much.
2.0,Would not recommend. I only needed to wear this thing for 3 weeks for work but still wish I'd just gone ahead and spent $20 on something nicer. The band is wicked cheap and barely reached around my wrist.
2.0,"Not what I expected.  They're tiny, and worst of all, don't breathe well."
2.0,See through. Fabric stick to my body
2.0,Very unflattering. I returned it
2.0,I am petite and ordered XS. There XS was loose on me.
2.0,Run small had to give to my daughter and she loves it
2.0,"I liked the warm lining inside the hat.  However, the stitching that was holding it in came loose.  There was a hole about 5 inches that came unstitched.  (I had not even had a chance to wear it outside.  I noticed the hole as I was trying it on.)  Instead of trying to send it back and risk dealing with the system that returns amazon prime products, I just hand sewed it back together myself."
2.0,The dress is &#34;wearable&#34; but it is cut very oddly. It also does not drape like the picture shows. If you do order this dress I would recommend ordering a size down
2.0,My son is sad it came ripped
2.0,"Ok, not great... a weird fit, the colored piece is rigid so sits funny around the neck"
2.0,"These are so cute, but the back is minute, so they didn’t stay on well. I’ve only been able to where each one once because when the backs fell off, they were never to be found, as they were too small to see on the ground."
2.0,"This skirt is good in every way except the terrible design in the waist. Hey, out there, I have news for you; heavy women need elasticity in the waist!"
2.0,kids fit too small
2.0,Tore on first use. Nothing I can't stitch up but sort of annoying that they tore after one 3 minute singing number.
2.0,"The material was cheap and for a men's cloak, very small."
2.0,"Bought these for my husband to wear at work in a warehouse all day.  However, the inner and outer soles fall apart rather quickly. In fact, the whole boot just comes apart at the seams.  Inside, nails pop through the heel and have ruined all of his socks and cause painful calouses.  I tried to contact the company for repairs, but they do not oblige.  Too much money for a product that comes apart in 6 months!"
2.0,Not a product flaw but these were too big and heavy for me.
2.0,It’s kinda clunky
2.0,I bought this to wear under medical scrubs. I hate them. The arms are way too long so its very bunched up. And no matter what I do it keeps riding up (and yes i have the correct size)
2.0,Mine came apart at the side seams after a couple of washings. My other satin nightgowns lasted for years unlike this one.
2.0,not useful for intended purpose
2.0,"I sent the dress BACK, I didn't like it."
2.0,"These triple rings were very popular about 30 years ago. I had a friend who loved his, so I thought I’d give this a try. I have to say, I’m really not impressed. I think his bands were flat and these are tubular, and maybe that’s the difference. I just didn’t feel like it was secure on my hand - it felt too loose, or like the floating rings were. I chose the silver one, and it just didn’t look appealing in person. I will say that the ring was well made and looked to be of good quality. But personally, I didn’t like it."
2.0,Nice and fluffy but pants are way too short . Makes it uncomfortable
2.0,I bought small size. Small  size is too big
2.0,"Ordered a 3xl and this was a size bigger than I normally order. IT DID NOT FIT. It fit like a small 2xl.  I dont wanna take the time to return it so, I gave it to my son"
2.0,These don’t tighten that well. They slip off. I’m not sure if there’s a better way to wear them. I’ve tried having the tie at the top of my head instead but it just doesn’t tighten at all
2.0,"My daughter is 3 3/4 and I bought the 4t.  She won't be able to wear it for long.  Its already too short, and it is barely big enough around.  She is on the smaller side of almost 4 as well.  Buy At Least one size up :(<br />Sad because she LOVES this and wears it everyday when we get home."
2.0,Wrong measurements as specify on the description which they are extremely big and it says that is a 6.3 inches elastic and I decided to measure it but it's an 8-inch without expanding it which the sellar sent me the wrong size.<br />To be honest I was very disappointed.<br />So what I decided to do was cut the section where the string was tied and remove four lava stone beads and tied it again. Now the bracelet fits and I hope this was helpful for you guys.
2.0,"This product does not drape at all as pictured, nor is it as form fitting. So far, it is still in the package which means I will not wear it."
2.0,"Cheap, and one of the charms broke right away."
2.0,"This dress wasn't what I expected. I checked the size chart, sized up and it was still too small. Also, it's stuff and unforgiving. I gave two stars for fast delivery and color. Useless that I can't wear it."
2.0,El vestido está hermoso y la tela de buena calidad pero no es elástico y la cintura está demasiado reducida
2.0,"It’s a good ring, however it couldn’t get it to open. I broke my nails and a couple tools that I used but still couldn’t get it open. It also is massive and only for larger fingers"
2.0,The first time I used it I could not  the nose to fit quite right and it leaked. I adjusted the head strap a few times. I am a woman so maybe it was made for a larger adult.
2.0,"This is a decent wallet.  It's not even close to worth the price though.<br /><br />The leather quality isn't anything extraordinary - as they claim.  The leather is already showing signs of wear after 4 months of everyday use.  The craftsmanship is decent provided it passes quality control.  Upon receipt, I had to send back the first one I received for a replacement because a cut in the leather was made too far.  Bellroy customer service wasn't good. They provided the bare minimum from what I'd expect from a higher end manufacturer.<br /><br />Paper bills need to be perfectly aligned in order to slide cleanly into the wallet - difficult if you have 5 or more bills.<br /><br />The pull tab is a piece of leather that has already stretched past it's original length.  Again, everyday use.  The pull tab is cheaply made.  If it were two pieces stitched together, it may prevent this from happening?<br /><br />I expect this wallet to last maybe 2 years.  On the plus side, it has forced me to reduce the amount of stuff that I've put in my wallet (compared to past wallets)."
2.0,I love how warm the pants are however I’m so bummed that they Came out of the package with threads hanging off the seam. :(
2.0,"I really wanted this to look good on me, but it fit like a potato sack. I ordered a medium (my normal size), but the dress was big in all of the wrong places. Material is very thin which made the dress just feel like a hospital gown. Needs better structure for sure."
2.0,Just looked baggy and then looked too tight. Fit too large on top and too small on the bottom.  Sending back.
2.0,This outfit was a bit too big and not only that the bows seem to be hanging on by a thread won't recommend washing. Lastly the leg covers do not fit what so ever and seem to be more like sleeves then leg covers. Wouldn't even stay on my baby's legs. Wouldn't recommend buying unless you're really just interested in the shirt and the over sized skirt.
2.0,"The color combo was much less speaking than I anticipated. The dots are uniform, larger and really unappealing. I will end up donating this."
2.0,Way too small - XXL is like a ladies large.  My wife likes it tho!
2.0,The threading just falls out. My daughter wore these dresses maybe 3 times before I started noticing the threading unraveling from the straps.
2.0,"This necklace is WAY longer than the picture leads you to believe. If you arrange it the way it is in the picture, the bottom leaf hangs between your... Well, in your decolletage. For the price, I'll keep it, add a clasp and shorten the chain so that it sits where I want it to. But be aware when you consider buying this, they hang low."
2.0,The band connectors are attached so that one side has the color of the connectors  and one side has the inside showing. Most obvious and annoying is the khaki which shows yellow inside (see photo). The green actually shows this way in the seller photos but didn’t notice it.<br />Band is comfortable and much better than the plastic bands. These bands do fade in the chlorine but they are not expensive to replace.
2.0,This Sandel was too big .
2.0,"I ordered the Primeshop-100 Pcs Assorted 150mm x 2.5mm Self Locking Nylon Wire Cable Zip Ties thinking that what would arrive was exactly what was in the picture (assorted zip ties in red, green, blue, and yellow), it wasn't.  I received 100 yellow zip ties.  I ordered these specifically for the different colors which I needed for a particular project.  I will have to order other zip ties to complete my purchase.  I can always use zip ties for other things.  At least they're not completely useless."
2.0,"The helmet itself is not bad but the problem is the strap. It is too long and cheaply made. You cannot tighten the helmet to your head. Also the helmet gives you a ""Star Wars storm trooper"" look.  Poor decision to purchase this. On the way back."
2.0,"I read the reviews before purchasing and was convinced to buy my normal size ( M 8–10). Because I’m curvier, I should’ve sized up! I had a very hard time getting the suit on, but once I did, it fit at the waist, was slightly tight in the chest, and tighter than I’m comfortable with in the stomach/hips. Overall, it’s a nicely made and generally flattering suit, but I wish I had sized up."
2.0,"Material was a bit inexpensive and too small for me, order a size up."
2.0,not true to size was too big and uncomfortable
2.0,"First of all, these leggings have see through panels on them. That is NOT in the picture, or in the description. If that’s what I thought I was getting, I wouldn’t have ordered. I’m keeping them because my husband likes them but I’m not comfortable wearing these to the gym."
2.0,"It should’ve been a skort instead of just a plain skirt.. quality is alright, I’ve gotten better clothing that’s $8"
2.0,Way to short and wrong color green was sent.  Item is being returned.<br /><br />The fabric is nice.
2.0,The color wasn’t as expected. It was also very boxy in the chest/shoulder area. Im 5’0 and 188 lbs and it hit below my knee. Overall just not very flattering to me. Also the seam in the front at the waist was ripping.. can’t imagine even throwing it in the washing machine without it falling apart. Really disappointed
2.0,"Happy to see this hat advertised in large size, as I have to wear a wig.  When it arrived, I tried it on, and even without wig it's too small!  Too bad you can't try these things on before you buy."
2.0,"Not as long as it looks. The cost was too big for how long I wanted it to be. I bought the XXL thinking I needed that based on height, but all the other dimensions were off"
2.0,Too skimpy............not a quality item.
2.0,Amethyst stone I received looks black in color and not at all in the purple/lavender color expected. Disappointed.  The green stone I received is very nice and I gifted it
2.0,Looked good and feels good but the buckle undoes when u sit down which makes the belt become loose. The material is good though but that little issue of constantly having to adjust the belt is annoying
2.0,"Belt works fine but has a weird smell to it, almost like old beets. Honestly feel like throwing it away."
2.0,The Bifocal Zone is too small.
2.0,"Was not fitted, too loose at the waist"
2.0,Cheaply made. Shipping took forever. Was not delivered until well after it was expected to arrive. Would not recommend.
2.0,Love the hat! Great quality But it came in shaped wrong. It’s off center. Sadly I didn’t notice til after the return period was over.
2.0,Please don't be fooled by the size of the picture presented!!! It is SO SMALL!! barely see it around your neck. The chain - piece of hair .. The Ruby - a speck of dust. That's why this small price.  And it came way to late ... took almost 5 weeks (oversea - in Europe).
2.0,Lenses are much thinner than the genuine ones and rattle around in the frame.<br />The big issue is that the lens are peeling only a few days after installing them.<br />The price would be good if the lenses held up
2.0,Love the design but as soon as my daughter wore them they have strings and fuzziness where the two colors meet. This happened at every connection of the white and green. Would not purchase this design again.
2.0,"This absolutely did not fit as expected. I was barely able to pull it over my head much less my boobs. I anticipate that but had hoped that just maybe they would squeeze into this.Not so much  I will accept that the 4X may fit a ...size 12? Maybe? My sister who has a smaller torso and chest than I do had a similar issue and she is 2 cup sizes smaller. So a B cup that can wear a American 10-12 can't wear this 4XL. Keep that in mind when you order. It did arrive promptly and on time as promised. It's super cute, I just can't wear it.[[ASIN:B01DEX8OJS Womens Sexy Off Shoulder Lace Blouse Shirt Long Sleeve V-Neck Tank Top Black 4XL]]<br />I was given a discount on this product in exchange for my honest opinion and review."
2.0,The size run small and the material was so<br />thin.
2.0,It's okay. The arms are too small.
2.0,The size chart was not accurate
2.0,Plastic. Have to reshape it or there are too many creases everywhere and it does't hang like that. It's like wearing a leather string vs. a metallic material with some weight to it.
2.0,"This product DOES NOT look at all like it is pictured, although the material from which it is made is nice and soft."
2.0,Can't see through well with my glasses.  Not as comfortable to wear over glasses.  Light plastic.
2.0,The wrist straps themselves are comfortable but the nylon that straps to my camera did not hold up. The 1st four I used broke right off. Never used the rest of them.
2.0,It’s super adorable but the face shield flew off the first use. my toddler was super disappointed.
2.0,It’s super cute but it shrinks tremendously in the wash and one of the buttons popped off within the first week or two. I would definitely buy from a different brand it’s not worth the hassle.
2.0,"I was expecting a better quality for the price,this being a northface product. Also the giant  tag stitched on reverse side is not really a good design. But again quality is sub par. I have already wore it so not returning but I am disappointed and won't buy it again."
2.0,I do not like it at all.  When I put it on it looks awkward the material is much lighter than i expected.  I am returning it when I get a minute.
2.0,"Nice looking but does not fit anything like it does this woman in the picture. At least for me it doesn't. I'm a bigger girl (size 16-18) and although it says it should fit me, it's tight and makes it look more like a shirt than a coverup. Doesn't even hang past my butt. 😞"
2.0,"Wore this for work- frequent handwashing led to the skin underneath the ring getting all ""pruney"" and I didnt really like how they felt.<br />But, it was nice not getting my ring caught on gloves all day."
2.0,This will probably make the costume box.  It fit a bit small.
2.0,"A bit small, but size okay.  So thin and had holes in both pairs of this set first time trying on"
2.0,Oh well
2.0,"Since I was given this as a gift from my husband and young son, I would never return it.  However, had I bought it myself, I would.  The aquamarine color is very, very dull, nowhere near as vibrant as the picture.  The CZ stones on the baby are also quite dull.  The price being charged is greatly inflated for silver, simulated gemstone and CZ.  Had they been able to see it in person, I don't think they would have picked this necklace."
2.0,"The tag says 6T but size is more like 4T, already too small for my 5 years old..."
2.0,I’ve had this product for a little less than two months and it keeps coming unclasp and my Apple Watch has dropped to the ground and I’ve cracked my screen on it because the watch band does not stay clipped.
2.0,Seems well made but I normally wear a 'large' when it comes to hats. I've purchased several boonie hats over the years and this is the first one that was too small to fit on my head
2.0,"Ok, so I get that this is a cropped sweater, but is it supposed to be 3/4 sleeve length. A mes."
2.0,"I do not like this Meow waist belt - it is too bulky and the strap is too wide.  It is not very comfortable when wearing it running.  It is poorly designed in that the leash/clip for keys is on the wrong side of the zipper.  You need to fully unzip the zipper then dig for your keys, possibly allowing stuff inside to fall out.  The leash/clip should be close to the close of the zipper - then you can even leave the keys dangling out and close the zipper, if needed. There is one lengthwise separator, but the compartment does not seem to fit or organize what I want to carry.<br /><br />I love the UD Jurek belt [[ASIN:B00D5R16VW Ultimate Direction Jurek Essential Waist Pack]] - it is very lightweight and comfortable.  I was looking for something bigger, to fit a smart phone and this Meow pack is not it."
2.0,"Low stars since its great quality, but way to small to fit many sun glasses in."
2.0,Sleeves are very scratchy and not enough room to raise your arms!  The top is very cute but is not one I would buy again...
2.0,Shirt is darker text us lighter. Hard to see lettering and image. Daughter was dissapoainted.
2.0,"This top is folded strange at the bust line.  I thought it would be pleated but it feels like it got stuck in the machine and sewed wrong.  I think it's supposed to be that way, but I don't like it."
2.0,"I bought this for my 7 year old who, like most, is obsessed with the Mandalorian. It is very thin, lightweight and just feels kind of cheap. It does what it is intended to do I guess which is to be a costume prop.  Not a toy by any means."
2.0,It is not as long as it seems to be in the picture
2.0,Beware…The fingers run very small/ tight.<br />Unfortunately because they’re really pretty gloves. Had to send them back.
2.0,Cheaply made. Some bottom balls were missing
2.0,"These are nice glasses, but kind of flat.  I'd give them more stars, but they just don't flatter (pun unintended) my face.<br />They come with a case, a silk bag with drawstrings, and a cleaning cloth.<br />Despite the pretty rose color reflective coating, the tint appears green looking through these glasses."
2.0,Didn't fit as aspected not did it look like photo. Material not appealing
2.0,"My mom got me these for christmas and whike they are cool shore, the blue lights on the right sgoe stipped working after one hour of wear. I thought the battery had run out but it was the lights themselves that stipped working. They are still cool shoes but im bummed the lights didnt last longer"
2.0,"I suppose it is decent for the low price. Good for working when u need  every inch of your fingers. it only covers up to below your knuckles. I hoped it cover up to the lowest part of my fingers; but it did not. I could have knitted it myself and is not ascetic, cute, or practical. incredibly disappointing."
2.0,So disappointing because this runs VERY small. I wish they had bigger sizes it’s a cute shirt that seemed well made.
2.0,"The weave is looser than what I thought, making it look like a poorer quality than it appeared in the pictures. I was hoping for a classier look. I should have known, you get what you pay for. It'll work."
2.0,The handbag came all scratched up.  I have not yet tried to clean it as I will most likely give it to Good Will.
2.0,"I am 125lbs, 5’7”. I rested a medium in yellow. While the size fit me almost perfect, it was a tad on the smaller side but still fit great. Because of the material, it is impossible to wear any undergarments without seeing the outline. Not to mention, this fabric is completely see through. I suggest wearing this at night time to avoid any private areas being exposed through the dress."
2.0,"Ordered on Jul 20 , 2020. My son usually wears size large. But this one after one month is small for him"
2.0,Not a good fit. Rolls down at waist.
2.0,Tangled too easy!! Won’t wear it.
2.0,"I'm returning this coat.  It's terribly cute; however, designed for a very small teenage frame. I'm a size 8 and ordered the XL knowing it would run small."
2.0,Im 5’8 and 185 lbs. I normally wear an XL in gym shirts  These shirts are very nice but too long for my height. So I am giving them to my wear to wear as pajamas around the house. These shirts are abt 2 inches too long. Im afraid if I order the size Large it may be too tight
2.0,"I was hoping these would last, as my son loves them. They are all he would wear. Sadly, after just two months, they are coming apart at the seems.<br />Sad, as otherwise, they seem great."
2.0,The shirt was very short. I have a short torso and even still it was short. It does not have the length like in the photo. It was a little disappointing.
2.0,cannot seem to figure out how this works.. a little bummed but will need to take extra time to see.
2.0,"I'm 4'11 and this ""dress"" was too short. I think it would make sense if it's advertised as a tunic."
2.0,This sweater was terrible! I have one just like it in brown in a smaller size that is more fitted. So I decided to order it in another color a few sizes bigger so it would be looser. It came yesterday and this sweater is actually tighter that the smaller sweater!!!
2.0,"Cute. Fell apart pretty quickly. I didn't pay very much for them, so I didn't try contacting seller or getting them returned."
2.0,Cheap material for the price point. I understand it’s Amazon exclusive but dang. 2 stars cause Metallica
2.0,"Bought this same suit from two different vendors. The Memory Baby suit was second to arrive. The bottoms fit as expected (I sized up once from what I normally wear) and the top was just not flattering. It was very loose on the bust, whereas the other suit was a perfect fit in the same size. The straps were too skinny to feel comfortable in, and they keyhole was MUCH larger than pictured and expected (was almost like a deep scoop neck). I sent this one back and kept the other brand."
2.0,The gems r falling out.
2.0,Looks like good quality but runs small
2.0,I ordered this shirt as part of my costume for Halloween. It was very baggy and weird material; like a towel. I will be returning soon.
2.0,La calidad muy baja
2.0,Top is cut much lower than expected.
2.0,Love how cute it is but it starred ripping on the first day. The front was undoing and the material is very thin.<br />Also- if you have a bit of a belly- you look pregnant
2.0,"Necklace is rather small  in every dimension, and appears inexpensive when seen in person. Would not recommend, particularly at this $60 Price. . ."
2.0,Sizing is on the smaller side (think snug vs. having to size up). The two black strips of fabric should come together in a V-shape near the belly button but on mine that happened about 3&#34; off. Fabric is of okay-good quality but I didn't like it so did not order a new one.
2.0,They arrived broken and flat as a piece of paper.
2.0,I thought it would have more pink instead of oranges and greens because those are not my colors.
2.0,The 1 x was too big.not what I was hoping for.The xl was to small
2.0,En la segunda puesta se descompuso el cierre ya no quiso cerrar se abrió
2.0,the leather is nice but the zipper is the weak part of it...I have now purchased two of these and both of them the zipper stitching has come apart after about 40 days...past the Amazon return policy...once the zipper doesnt shut it defeats the purpose of having the zipper...back to my search for finding the optimal mans front pocket wallet...I am open for any suggestions....
2.0,The midi length doesn't hit right on my frame.
2.0,Cracks in more than half of the stones
2.0,Picture is misleading!! The shorts fit However the top is a crop top!! Not a tank top it’s cute but...
2.0,I received the wrong dress and the fit was off. I also had ordered the same style dress in a different brand and that other dress was much more flattering than this one. This dress was very tight in the stomach area and not as flowy. Not impressed.
2.0,The material quality isn’t that great.
2.0,The lense popped out. I lived thatbthey were matte. not those shiny ones. but the when i folded them to put in my glove box the lense gell out. i tried popping it back in.but it wouldnt stay in. Oh well they fit good when i wore them.
2.0,The product is ok if I can receive clips to replace broken ones.<br />I can’t attach the handles because of broken clips!!<br />I will need to return items if no response is given
2.0,"Printing was off center.  My son still really like to be sure, but I was definitely disappointed."
2.0,These gloves feel great and I was so excited to use them but I haven’t even had them a week and it’s ripped …
2.0,"Seriously? Trying to get these on a stud should be a challenge on “Survivor”.  Took me FOREVER, and still not 100% sure was in properly.  Find something better and easier to use."
2.0,Although the fit is fine - I did not receive the boxers pictured. Instead the boxers are different and two pairs have dogs and bears on them. My son is not an animal lover and will likely not like wearing these.
2.0,Sort of disappointment
2.0,"It fit but the material was see-through. If you need a lightweight undershirt it would work, but it did not suit the purpose of covering my tattoos under my work uniform so I had to return it."
2.0,Runs small.Could not wear my regular size.Should order one size larger.
2.0,Disapointed
2.0,"I could never get the ball to stay in place once I stretched the ring to put it in my nose. The balls aren't screw on, they just sit there."
2.0,"Seemed cool and practical at first. Nice design, durable. But, after about a week of having it, it became less and less practical, a pain to get my cards out and wasn’t as convenient as I thought it was going to be. Wish I could give it more stars but unfortunately I can’t. Already had to purchase a different card holder."
2.0,"It is cute in concept, but it was definitely too big for me. The fabric was what I expected, I just wish it would fit me."
2.0,Shoe strings broke the first time we put them on. Amazon was great about the return. Very sparkly but somewhat cheap looking
2.0,"Didn't hug my body, I returned."
2.0,These started to discolor only after a few wears.
2.0,"Chinese Garbage watch.<br />Broke after 1 week.<br />Hardly worth it to send it back.<br />If you tell them it's broken, they send you the .pdf instructions that you already have!<br />Duh! I know how to wind up a watch dammit.<br />Should send a retour/postage voucher, but like said, at this price why bother.<br />Buy another watch.<br />The mechanics are cool to watch but to fragile."
2.0,Dress is like a nightgown.
2.0,Way to small but will give it to my daughter.
2.0,Only used it once and it turn. Pretty but good for a one time use
2.0,"I don't know if it's this particular brand, but when I try to pull these up over my nose, they just fall right back down. Like immediately. The only way I can get them to stay up is by tucking them over my ears, which means they're also over my eyes and it's very unwieldy. I got the same ones in a different color for my husband and they seem to work fine for him, so maybe I just have a small head? But women with ""small heads"" beware."
2.0,Tore up the seam first time I wore it
2.0,"sized way too small, poorly sewn"
2.0,They will not stay on my ears. Pop off almost every time
2.0,"Great to cover tattoos for work, but they slide off the upper part of the arm."
2.0,"I've had mine for a few weeks now and have used this quite a few times.<br /><br />The beanie fits my head well, the sound quality is decent, and the volume goes to a fairly loud level... Only issue I'm having is that the speakers are held in place within the beanie by velcro tabs. On both the control side and the opposite: the velcro has come unstuck from the speakers.<br /><br />Basically... I have a beanie with two speakers (connected by a wire) moving around freely inside."
2.0,the drawstring on this bag ripped out from the bag almost immediately... luckily i was able to rig it... this was on day 1 of 18 backpacking through japan...
2.0,Your hands get wet when you use it
2.0,I thought I was buying a large sweatshirt that would fit me like the picture shown but it is tight around; tighter than I wanted. The fabric is thin and not a traditional sweatshirt because it's more of a thick t-shirt fabric made to look like a sweatshirt. The inside is 100% not sweatshirt.
2.0,This looked unflattering and awkward. I bought it in multiple colors due to the price and a discount and ended up sending them all back promptly. That side stitching doesn't do anything to enhance the look of the shirt.
2.0,"It was a nice shirt if it was not so small. I gave it away to someone who normally is a size medium, but the tag said it was a 3x."
2.0,"3 sizes of rings are nice, but the smallest is too small for anything really. I have a double helix piercing and I used a medium hoop for the bottom hole and a large for the top hole. The part of the ring that comes out of the hoop is very hard to get back in once it comes out, especially if you’re trying to do it behind your ear. I gave it 2 stars because when I finally got them in they look and feel good but getting them in and keeping them there was very difficult. Also, the part that goes through the ear is at an angle which made insterting them slightly painful."
2.0,Don't expect to fit a lot in there. It won't snap.
2.0,"It gets the job done but if you value your pillow casings then stay away from this product. These things bleed all over pillow casings like there’s no tomorrow.<br /><br />Personally I don’t care because I use cheap pillow cases and couldn’t care less if they get discolored. For those with expensive bed sets though, beware."
2.0,These rings were cute but each one was a different size
2.0,"Order up a size I order L I'm 5""6 155lb to small it does have STRETCH"
2.0,The colors are not as vivid as shown. Going back.
2.0,"I DO NOT LIKE IT,  IT COMES UNDONE EVERY TIME, I AM A SECURITY OFFICER AT A HOSPITAL SO I RUN TO CODES, WALK ALL DAY AND SIT. THE CLAMPS ARE NOT THAT GREAT THE SHIRT COMES UNDONE WHEN I SIT. ITS ANNOYING I HAVE TO KEEP CLAMPING THE SHIRT BACK TOGETHER."
2.0,Cheaply made. Almost see through
2.0,"Love the purse, however the liner has shredded in a couple of places and the small outside pocket zipper has broken. Also the silver around the handles has rubbed off leaving a pink color. I have only had this purse for a month and can no longer return it. Not happy"
2.0,I loved the look of this hat but the bull was on crooked. It was very awkward and I was unable to wear. I ended up returning it. Super cute though!
2.0,I took this band off after three days and put the original band back on. I kept having to adjust the band to tighten it when ever I put it on. The whole point of a band like this is to make it easier to put off and on without adjustment. I could never get it right and would not buy this ever again.
2.0,"after 10 or 12 washings in warm water(no bleach) they were barely long enough to stay up all day, I don't have very long legs either, 31 inseam"
2.0,"I've been using this luggage for 2 months (4 trips) and the frame above one of the wheels (on the large suitcase) has already cracked, which will not allow the wheel to support the weight of suitcase when it is packed. The suitcase will no longer roll properly, which renders it useless!!"
2.0,"Disappointed that there was a hole in one of my boot shapers.  When I opened the package and filled it with air, it would not retain the air.  The other 5 in the pack were ok, but I’m disappointed I cannot use the defective 6th shaper."
2.0,I'm having trouble getting the vest to heat up. Do I need any other device?
2.0,Center of bracelet is covered in plastic and appears to be a sticker inside.
2.0,"I purchased the sunflower one, red one, green floral  and dark blue floral. I love the first two but the one I had just ordered (dark blue floral) was used. I could tell it had been washed. I will be returning it. The others fit great. The green floral was not the same material as the sunflower one. I like the sunflower one better because the fabric was a mix and not just polyester. I believe the green with floral was all polyester and a bit too heavy; wish it was of the same material as the sunflower one. I do still like it."
2.0,"Good quality construction but extremely short. I have a 7.5&#34;+ wrist (a hair over 19cm) and I am on one of the last holes in the strap. There is no room to add any more holes either. If you have a 7&#34; or under wrist, this may work for you. If you have a larger wrist, keep looking."
2.0,Correct size but didn't fit me well.
2.0,Good price I thought.... Fell apart as soon as I took them apart
2.0,Not an XXL but more like a Large size.  Really small.
2.0,"Super cute, hard to breathe in. Two stars because when I tried it on I noticed seams weren’t even stitched in places. Returned"
2.0,a little tight in thighs.
2.0,"These were pretty inexpensive so I should have expected a lower quality product.  Brand new they seemed to be of very good quality.  However, these had only one winter season of use in them.  They are not waterproof, just walking outside when its raining or through snow caused water to get inside. the inside is lined with a very soft warm fuzzy lining. But after it gets wet, they stink and its no good.  Also the bottom soles started to come apart.  Not really worth the money if you want to use them more than once."
2.0,Don’t get me wrong it’s a beautiful dress but the boob area wasn’t complimentary to any woman’s figure I had to go in and get the padding and wires taken off to make the dress fit well. I would suggest the maker just looks the wires and padding on the dress and leave it without it. It made the dress fit better and look better once I did.
2.0,The shirt is really pretty but way too small! I ordered large (5'4 150lbs 38 c ) and couldn't even put it on. I am giving it to friend's kid...
2.0,"It's fits alright. Just doesn't look that good at all. The dress it's too long for me. It's passed my knee. I am like 5'4, so I assume if ur taller, might look better for you. Too much dress alike and same price range. No need an extra one that just so so... might not even wear for 2 nd time."
2.0,"It wasn’t what I expected or what it lol s like in the picture. The wings are on but somewhat uncomfortable and I couldn’t even wear the mask, the hair gets in your mouth and nose. Has to throw it away."
2.0,This bracelet is so stiff. I could not bend it to stay on my wrist. I tried in a vise. Still could not make smaller.
2.0,I’m used to a more fitted dress. Shape was too boxy for me. I returned it.
2.0,"top was soiled and very small, bottoms were too large.  opposite of my body, could work for some.  stain on top was dissapointing, but they honored the return."
2.0,very thick ring.  Believed the Got-cha was held in center but was on outer side of a two piece folded fabric.  Overly large item for such a small device.  Prongs on Got-cha stick out and catch on mesh when using.
2.0,"They were polyester not cotton. They Fit well, but the polyester becomes irritating after wearing all day. Packaging was in Chinese and unable to read."
2.0,its very small as if for children and it has a very horrid smell like uncured leather.
2.0,I bought my daughter a 12.5 in this shoe and a 12 in another shoe. She normally wears a 12 right now. I figured it would be a bit bigger and she could grow into it. It is smaller than the other shoe that was a 12. And the strap that goes across the shoe is a bit short so it barely fit her foot.
2.0,The bottoms sagged too much. Bought them to use for her at school but can’t because there’s about 4 inches of extra fabric
2.0,The dress is seriously small. Size large is 12-14. I wear a 10 or 12. The straps are tight and loose at the same time. It shows much better in photos than it looks in person. I bought it in white. I wish it fit as expected.
2.0,"This is made terribly cheap fabric, and feels rather like wearing a tablecloth. The sleeves are dolman, which I hate and never would have ordered. It is advertised as long-sleeved; it is not. It's not even 3/4 sleeve. They are somewhere between short and elbow length. I rarely leave negative reviews, but this is very far from what was stated. Perhaps I'll gift it to my 92 year-old mother.<br />'"
2.0,Seems like thin and cheap material. Returned.
2.0,No really fleece--maybe sorta a light-weight fleece on the inside but is rayon or something on the outside.  Not sure it's going to be very breathable.  Also is sewn with a contrasting NAVY stitching for some reason (which is not as pictured) and stands out like a sore thumb.  Otherwise is decently made. Don't have the energy to return it so will probably donate.
2.0,I really did like it until the chain broke the second time I wore it. I was so disappointed. Guess you can't expect much when you don't pay much.
2.0,Mask looks similar to the one in the advertisement but nowhere the quality. Looks like something I could've gotten off Wish
2.0,"This dress offers no shape even with the bow. The material is not lined & is very thin. My expectations are not very high when looking at clothes on amazon, but this dress was just awful"
2.0,"BROWN IS NOT BROWN! If you're looking for a burgundy/brown this is what you want. The bag shown doesn't look anything like the one I recevied. They enclosed it in two bags which was nice but there was no filler on the inside to keep it's shape. It looks like an old, used handbag from the bottom of someone's closet. The leather on the front is very nice - on the back and sides - terribly wrinkled and creased! I bought this as a gift but there's no way I can give this! So very disappointed in Amazon's quality control."
2.0,"The necklace is beautiful. A great bargain. The earrings are pretty, but cannot open to insert scent pad."
2.0,"Just not great quality. I got the size suggested and it isn’t fitting my bust well. The length isn’t great, the whole thing just leaves something to be desired. Pretty much anything I buy on amazon that’s not a T-shirt or basic clothing item looks cheap"
2.0,You get what u pay for. It’s so pretty and lots of compliments but the chain broke the second time I wore it.
2.0,"The dress is cute the material is a little thin though. It came with the bow hanging off this really pissed me off, and I just didn't want to deal with the hassle of returning it so, I had it repaired. That wasn't cool though this is why I only gave it 2 stars."
2.0,"The cardigan was nice and it fit well. However, it was not a true white like the photo shows so I returned it."
2.0,"While the size seems accurate, as well as the description, its overall quality is poor. The zipper is fraying and  doesn't slide well, the color is a strange brown, it isn't soft on the inside, only athletically on the outside. The inside fabric is actually a bit scratchy. It hasn't softened with washing, only pilling and feeling and looking cheaper."
2.0,It was easy enough to put the watch in the band and put it on. It was more comfortable than the original band too. I had to wear it all the way on the last hole and it fit snug. I guess it still wasn't tight enough though because the watch fell out. I'm not happy this happened after wearing it for only a few hours. These watches aren't cheap. I had run a lot of errands that day and didnt know it was gone until the end of the day but luckily enough it was found at home.
2.0,I like the idea of the zipper on a sports bra. Sometimes they can be a challenge to get off and on. The thing I really don’t like about the zipper is it protrudes out so much. When wearing a shirt over it you can definitely see it sticking out. Comfy and the zipper works but I don’t like the aesthetics of the bulging zipper
2.0,Not good as I excepted.
2.0,The visor was not straight. I should have sent it back but I did not. Definitely not made correctly.
2.0,"I only needed it for a birthday party, but the little nib on top immediately came out and just stayed in by friction."
2.0,"When I got it and unfold it to try it on, it started sheeding. So I washed it to get rid of it that didn't not work because it started sheeding again, Meaning when I started wearing it again the fabric will drop on the floor. It was very  noticeable."
2.0,Top and bottom fit. But back clasp on top feels really cheap. I’m not sure it would survive the washing machine let alone a trip to the beach. I returned.
2.0,returned. not true to size
2.0,Beautiful but runs very small. I returned it for a refund.
2.0,"Extremely uncomfortable! I didn't try to return then in time, so I am not sure how that process would go. Sucks for me! They look okay, loose across the foot. The arch supports are overkill and very uncomfortable. I have very average size feet and had hope they would make good house shoes. Disappointed"
2.0,"Bought the large size, I guess they are large on a child."
2.0,"When empty, this wallet is as slim and attractive as in the pictures. When loaded with cards, the wallet cannot be folded properly; it will open up again once pressure is removed. It's going back, because I wanted to put more than just cards in the wallet, and it clearly doesn't even have room for the cards alone."
2.0,"Uneven seams, threads hanging out. The shirt looked years old after one wash and rolled up everywhere out was sewn poorly.  Looks like it was purchased from a 1st time 7th grade home ec class.  I'm pretty much over the cheapy clothes.  JCP clothes hop on to other kids, this is wash & toss."
2.0,I received two right earrings in order to fix one I had to very carefully bend and reshape it. The earrings also appear much longer in the photos .
2.0,"[[VIDEOID:b75d9de4792e1f7bee9b9ab0f4c59cf8]] La talla que pedí es Médium pero me salió Small y en la etiqueta dice M  lo mismo me pasó con una gorra que pedí, ya no me está gustando está aplicación"
2.0,I was so excited to find a long robe. I checked the size chart and sizes up because I wanted the extra room. I normally wear a 22 and ordered a 4X. My friend tried it on and it just barely fit her as a size 16. The quality matches the price as it’s ok.
2.0,Loved the look and size but two stones have already fallen out barely a month later
2.0,"Sooooooo stinking cute!!!! When it arrived it was very smelly but washing it helped<br /><br />Update: going from 5 stars to 2.... this looks so ridiculous on. As you can see in the photo, you can see baby’s legs and diaper. The snaps don’t really keep the legs snapped up tight."
2.0,"Wasn't what I expected, too tight."
2.0,I have barely had the necklace six months and it broke while I was putting it on. Bart even worn it due to looking for a charm to go on it and finally I had found one I loved and then it broke.
2.0,Did not look like picture at all. Needed pliers to unscrew.
2.0,was returned back to seller
2.0,Weird shape. Doesn’t fit good. Waste of money
2.0,"My son loves among us and that’s why I ordered for him these masks. But as soon as I got it and saw fabric I understood he cannot wear it at school. Fabric is tooooooo thick not possible to breathe through. There are three  layers in the mask. Also it’s terrible polyester. Disappointed! If I could see it and touch before buying, I would never order it."
2.0,"This ring was bought as a gift for Christmas.  The ring is adjustable as described.  The top part of the ring spins freely and is silent.  My daughter loved the ring.  However, in the two short weeks that she has worn the ring and the silver coating is coming off.  I'm very disappointed.  I paid more for this ring and could have bought a set of three for less money.  I bought this one hoping it would be a better quality."
2.0,I have quite a few dresses from MSBASIC - I bought this because it appeared to be an identical style (but different color fabric/pattern) to another one I had from them - the other dress is a nice medium weight cotton jersey type fabric of good quality<br /><br />This material appears to be very thin/low quality and nothing near as good as other dresses from MSBASIC
2.0,"Nice in the beginning, but the colors tarnished. Waste of money."
2.0,I wear L and ordered XL and it was way to tight!
2.0,"It arrived, and the feathered piece had come off, so I had to get the glue gun out. Then I tried it on and the left side of the mask remained over my eye no matter how much adjusting I did. We moved the ties around, and with some bobby-pin magic I was able to get it to stay in place. I was still adjusting it throughout the night though, and it was annoying.<br /><br />The good thing: it is quite beautiful, just shotty craftsmanship."
2.0,"Fit would be perfect but they are extremely long for bike shorts (below the knee) and very high wasted (4"" above belly button.) luckily I have a seamstress in the family or I'd send them back. Very comfy tho."
2.0,"says it's a ""crewneck sweatshirt"" this is more like a thin workout shirt"
2.0,lock on front flimsy and unpractical<br />returned the bag
2.0,"I liked that it was long as expected. The color was accurate, but the sizing is super big around the stomach. I usually wear a small to medium and this was huge. I bought the small. If you like it go one size smaller."
2.0,"EDITED- Wife liked it, buf broke after the 2nd wear. Strap will break, its felt like it was made of recycled paper. BEWARE!<br /><br />Minimalistic design, great for casual wear and perfect for spring or summer dress wear. My wife loves the watch, hates the strap.<br />In the Box : Watch, Warranty Card, Microfiber.<br />Overall a great cheap watch but looks elegant and fashionable. Strap is very cheap, and stiff. I recommend investing on a nice leather strap with easy removable latches. This watches color scheme will work on many types of straps. Value for the money I say 3 stars since the extra strap may run you a few bucks maybe $10-$20 more. Comfort 2 stars since it is based on how the straps perform. Very stiff and hard to put on with one hand by yourself.  But still, for what its worth still a beautiful looking watch."
2.0,"Overall, the build quality is not that bad. The tool to remove band links works well, it's fairly straight forward, and the fit with the Charge 2 head is decent.<br /><br />The main issue with this band is the clasping mechanisms. It has a double clasp, which means there is a button on either side of the band to undo a side. And compared to a normal wrist watch that has a similar clasp, these buttons are quite large. If I had the size tight enough to keep the Charge  flush against my skin, any time I bent my wrist downward or pushed my arm through a jacket, the band would unclasp as it pressed against my wrist. If I added one more link into the band, then it would be too loose, and I noticed the accuracy from the Charge 2 would drop dramatically.<br /><br />I walked for about 200 steps, counting, and it only caught about 30 steps, where the same walk was captured within 5 steps with the default band. While it didn't constantly unclasp like it did on a tighter sizing, the band still had issues coming lose when putting on clothes, or lifting large things. It only takes slight pressure on either side of the clasps to cause it to come loose. This band wouldn't work for a regular watch, much less a fitness tracker that relies on staying in contact with your wrist.<br /><br />In the end, I'm returning it after giving it an honest week of use. I need my charge 2 to give me accurate readings, and this band does not provide that."
2.0,I don't know what I was expecting? At the price I paid I should have known it was play jewlery. I bought it as a gift but it is so junky I'm too embarrassed to give it.
2.0,"I like that it comes from Scotland but it was way too small for a man. They shouldn't advertise for a man. I purchased for my son but no way would it fit him. I'm a small woman and it barely fit.  Also, it needs a soft lining, too rough."
2.0,I returned this hat because the color was more of a camel color than beige. It was not as pictured and was not a flattering color on me.  I was looking for a lighter color.
2.0,"These were supposed to be flesh colored but they're not even close. They're more white, I'm really disappointed 😞"
2.0,"Arrived broken. Waste of money. I like the style and design, just really cheap material."
2.0,Looks nice but doesn't not stretch. Too small for my husband's head
2.0,"I understand the world we live in and how it relates to global trade but why do it seem as if all of Amazon's goods are coming from China. Second point, the necklace was bought as a gift. The quality is such that I will not give it and probably throw it away. Money wasted."
2.0,"Sadly, these came with a tear in the crotch.  I stiched it as best as possible."
2.0,sunlight goes through a lot of it so it didn't help much...got my face covered if I had it at the exact angle and the handle isn't long enough for me to rest it on my shoulder...arm hurting after 10 min holding it lol<br />nice for decoration but not for someone who actually uses parasols to protect themselves from the sun
2.0,Love it but the leather strap fell off after 3 months
2.0,"Longer than expected, the white is too see through so you can see the shelf bra very obviously. The black is fine but still longer than expected"
2.0,Small was still too big in the waist even tho had a drawstring waist
2.0,"Returned for refund. Easy return. Does not look like the picture either. Thought it was more tunic like, not really though. Returned with no issues though"
2.0,"I'm 5'6"" 150 lbs and ordered a large. This doesn't fit like a jacket more like a tight shirt with a zipper."
2.0,"It's a decent vest but it smells terrible, like FISH. I AM RETURNING THIS ASAP!"
2.0,"I love the way that the dress looks in the photo, but in real life, the proportions are very different and the fabric is much darker. First of all, the bust and arms seem very tight compared to the fit of the dress overall. The empire waistline seems very high, and this is not often a problem that I have with this style of garment. I love the plaid fabric, and it would look so cute with leggings and boots, but just know that the fabric has absolutely no stretch to it at all. I'm disappointed- the fit just seems way off and isn't flattering."
2.0,"I bought two packages and I had one mouse missing an eye, and it was not in the package and one fish with a broken fin. Not impressed."
2.0,"The heart pendant is not big enough, so it slips easily through the loop. I tried wearing it and with just normal jostling/walking, it came undone and fell off. Badly designed! Too bad, because I really liked it otherwise!"
2.0,"I agree with the previous reviewer; the links get loose, and then fall apart on you. This has resulted in the watch literally falling off my arm several times. Despite having it repaired, it still happens, so I don't wear the watch anymore (I'm afraid of losing my $1200 watch!). My husband has the same version, but with the leather strap, so he doesn't have this problem; instead, he has to buy an expensive custom strap every 2 years...."
2.0,Item looked as shown but disappointed in color.  I choose rose gold.  The finish just was not what I was used to seeing as rose gold.  Pictures to be placed inside expanding locket will have to be glue to locket to keep them intact
2.0,Two stars because the graphic is cute BUT the SIZE is very disappointing! It runs SMALL and fits very snug. Size up 2 sizes at least if you prefer a looser fit. The 5% spandex makes this feel like a polyester not what i was expecting at all. We'll see how it washes... if it gets any smaller it's getting returned.
2.0,Not the same colors. Mine have 70% this green-yellow mixture its unsightly to me.
2.0,Arrived on time. When I trade then on you  see through them 😔
2.0,"I can't figure out how to use this so they're both in the drawer, most likely never to be seen again."
2.0,"The quality of fabric and construction was good.  The size however was wayyyyyy off.  I am true to an XL in all clothing and although the top fit, It was too tight across shoulders and underarms.  The bottoms could not even be pulled up over my knees."
2.0,"Gave as a gift, and while nice initially, they caused a lot of lint."
2.0,I didn’t like the way it looks on me. I’m 5’7 the dress was short on me not like the picture show.
2.0,Needs a lot of improvements
2.0,"They broke the 3 rd time my daughter wore them, too many spots where they are too high off the hand, where they would get caught up"
2.0,The soles are already falling off after wearing them 1 time. I tried to glue them bavk in place and they just don't hold
2.0,The shirt material was very nice and soft but it didn’t match with the stiff lacy sleeves. The combo seemed strange to me and not what I wanted for work.
2.0,I purchased this individual pair and really loved them. Well they accidentally was thrown away and I searched until I could replace this exact pair.  I later found a 5-pair pack that were the cost of this individual pair.  So search for the better price.  The quality of the frame is good and they are really durable.  Better than those $1/cheap glasses that I was previously purchasing.  These don't break easily.I only gave the low rating because of the price.
2.0,Not very good fabric
2.0,"BAD: The chain is heavily tarnished and broken. The clasp is broken off the chain on both ends and tossed loose in the package. It is impossible to repair as the chain is a tubular mesh with blunt ends (no loops on which to attach the clasp). GOOD: The pendant itself is pretty. The stones are a very deep turquoise color. I replaced the chain, and it's now good-to-go."
2.0,"I have used this luggage for 2 months. It is sturdy and easy to wheel around airports. I typically use it as a carry on, however on a few occasion, on smaller plains they make me check it in. During the two moths of ownership, I've checked it in 4 times. This past week was one of those times.<br />When I picked up my luggage, one of the aluminum corners was missing. (As you can see in the picture.) I was enjoying the case until then. For $189 I expected it to be more durable and man-handling resistant. Buy if you never have to check your luggage. It is a good looking and working case."
2.0,"A super cute bathing suit, but I wish we were able to buy the top and bottom separately. I need an M top and S bottom... but am now stuck with both M top and M bottom. The bottoms are huge! Will be returning."
2.0,"The ring looked beautiful, but unfortunately the one I received was obviously resized and the band wasn't finished properly where the resizing was.  I ended up having to return the ring due to this &#34;defect&#34;."
2.0,Ring is cheaply made
2.0,The bottom of bathing suit too big the length too short and the top too small
2.0,"I thought these nose rings were really cute! They were easy to put in, but hard to take out! The ends of the nose ring rubbed a sore in the inside and outside of my nose. I pulled it lose a little bit and that didn’t work. I couldn’t take it out by myself because my nose were extremely sore! I had to get someone else to take it out for me."
2.0,"Super short, im only 5'4 and its too short now wearing it as a top"
2.0,"I brought these to wear with my Rothy's. The socks are comfortable but, they make my feet feel sweaty."
2.0,"I was really disappointed after receiving my package, because of the color. It's clearly YELLOW , not GOLD"
2.0,Too was too small
2.0,The zipper was broken.  The legs were loose and unflattering.  Returned.
2.0,"These earrings are pretty, I guess. The truth is that they are almost too small to see. They are nicely packaged in a pretty little bos,I really don't see the point. It is not worth the money to send them back, so I will save them for a gift. One of our granddaughters may like them, although they would be dangerous for a small child since they could be swallowed."
2.0,Very weird dry fit material. Do not recommend buying to use as a towel because the material is not absorbent at all.
2.0,"Stud broke off the first time I picked it up. Shame, because they were really pretty."
2.0,"I'm so bummed that this shirt didn't fit!!! I have small shoulders (I'm petite) and the shirt fit great, except for the part along the top of the back of the shirt.  That one strip of material was hanging off my shoulders. I hated to return this shirt but I wouldn't be able to make the alterations myself without messing the whole shirt up."
2.0,They don’t look as pretty as on the picture
2.0,El color no es como aparece en la foto!  Ya real se ven de mala calidad!
2.0,"they roll up at the legs when you move around, not super ideal for working out but still cute and comfy for the gym/lifting"
2.0,My kid feel so so
2.0,The fabric is too thin. And too long for me.
2.0,Not a good fit for that I give it  a 1 star
2.0,Nice top just smaller than expected
2.0,"These are OK if you want to gamble with them being broken, missing pieces or them falling off your face cause ear pieces are stretched out. Bought 4 pair for that reason and only 2 out of the 4 didn't have issues. Threw 2 of them away, couldnt use. These are cute, but if you really want them, order extra maybe you will at least get one that works with no issues."
2.0,Fit oddly.
2.0,They’re alright. I definitely feel like they look nothing like the picture I thought they would be more of a soft material but they’re not they’re pretty thick and not super stretchy as I would like. I ordered my regular size with an XL and honestly I wish I ordered a size up (if they had that size) they feel a little to tight for my liking.
2.0,Slippers were size 6 when I ordered a size 7. Had a sticker labeled &#34;7&#34; over the molded 6 in the bottom of the slipper.
2.0,"Seemed nice until the seam ripped the first week. Not even a mechanic, I stock groceries."
2.0,I am only 5'6&#34; tall and this dress was above my ankles
2.0,"The only reason I am giving the product 2 stars is because I received the dresses and they were worn because I had no other option. The quality of the dresses were sub-par. Here are the reasons I was dissatisfied: 1. The dresses were very thin, 2. The dye lot in the bottom half of the ddresses was blotchy which made dark blue spots throughout, 3. The bodice is almost see thru, and 4. The tail of the thread from sewing in the zipper was left on the outside of one dress. I certainly won't purchase another one of these dresses and I am tossing the ones I purchased."
2.0,"I was excited about this. When it came it was marked xl in all countries? It was tight and short, not like a XL in the US should fit. It is getting sent back....I'm sad"
2.0,The strap is not long enuf to go across the body and it's a little to small for my checkbook wallet
2.0,This bracelet is TINY. I bought it for my almost 2 year old and it doesn't fit around her average size wrists. Definitely for a munchkin that is 1 or under. I also am concerned about the stability of the bracelet. The chain is so thin and fragile and the part where the heart is stamped is so soft. It bent right in half when I was pulling it out of the box.
2.0,They are super super tiny. They didnt even fit my 3yr old. But they are super cute and good quality. They fit my tragus piercing but I only have one and don’t need the other. Returning item unfortunately.
2.0,My hat was delivered along with two other items in a bag. The hat was smashed flat and very wrinkled. Not too happy with the condition it was in.
2.0,Very Tiny! Not worth the $6. Not bigger than my finger nail
2.0,Runs big. Didn't like them at all. And very thin material. Fake polo
2.0,I purchased 3 pair of these shoes based on the size chart and the current size of my children shoes. They were all larger than the size we are used to.
2.0,Super thin material.  Only good for Halloween because you get what you pay for!
2.0,I like the details but the strings hurt my ears will not be buying any more of this kind of mask
2.0,"this could be a beautiful dress, because the materials are little thin, it bunch up at the chest,  that's why I put a low ratings,  need to have a little thicker materials to hold the piping stripe across the upper body, other wise this dress could be pretty.  Not recommending it,"
2.0,"Too short I’m 5’9,  160 got a Medium and the dress came just pass my calves was expecting a longer fit like in the picture, see through material and single stitching caused a tear on the seam at the split, but overall a beautiful dress"
2.0,Warm and cute but the zipper split at the bottom after wearing it once.  I thought it was just a bad zipper on that one and exchanged it.  They did make exchanges easy.  Good customer service. The zipper broke again in the first week on the replacement.
2.0,Length was to short and crotch part felt very awkward and I had a hard time putting the buttons cuz the hole was too small. I'm 5'5 and I weigh 140 and I got a medium. I'm thinking I might need a large? I'm very unsure at this point!
2.0,"Thin, see-through material. Does not seem absorbent. Only one ply. Clearly unsuitable to prevent disease transmission. The only reason I didn’t knock it down to one star is that to be fair the description does say it’s one ply and polyester. I just never guessed it would be this thin and flimsy."
2.0,"The outfit was really cute, but the size ran very small for a small."
2.0,"Cute colors. And it was a tad difficult to place but I did love them...for about a week. Then my nose was super red, tender and puss was just flowing. Once I removed the ring my nose was fine in a few days."
2.0,I bought this as a gift for a birthday and I was expecting the box to be at least hard like a box and it's very cheap and flimsy I'm kinda embarrassed to give it to my friend in the box I'm very disappointed!!
2.0,The material isn’t what I expected. I thought it would be a cotton blend.
2.0,This looks fake and is not as delicate as I had hoped. The chain is nice and durable though and if you like heavier jewelry pieces you may like this.
2.0,Love the color and size. However after having it less than two weeks both zipper pulls (the metal included not just the leather) have snapped off- and it wasn't like I was being forceful with it. So now it makes zipping and unzipping it a chore.
2.0,"Fit is good and initially very pretty, but after one night of dancing at a wedding and typical 7 year old girl movement, the fabric on the toes was shredded."
2.0,"I returned it for several reasons. 1)The straps that make it look so sweet are supposedly stretchy but instead of them stretching over the shoulder, they pull the front of the bra up, so that I could feel my breast slipping out at the bottom.  2) The band was much more snug than I'd be comfortable in for very long.  3) The foam pads have weird creases in each of them... it makes it look as if you have wide inverted nipples! Very noticeable. I doubt that would unlikely ever return to normal after washing. I'd have taken them out if I kept the bra but with the slippage problem in #1 above, that wasn't an option. 4) it's nice soft stretchy material but the sewing quality is not great in that the sides pucker along the seams - not a returnable offense but worth noting.  The plusses: 1) the color is pretty...it's not exactly hot pink but bolder than I expected, def. not pastel. 2) the wide scoop neckline is very flattering.  Color me: disappointed!"
2.0,cheaply made and did not have the button like in the picture. the paw were already coming off when we got it
2.0,"Mediocre quality. Stones are nice, but I had to buy a new chain because the one that came with the set was tarnished and very cheap quality.  I would not recommend this set, especially if you’re buying it as a gift for someone else."
2.0,This was a gift. I really wanted this mood ring and when I got it it looked nothing like the picture at all!! Plus don't get it wet bc now there's a bubble at the bottom. It still changes color but I was very disappointed that it's different
2.0,"This picture does not depict what you actually get as far as variety.  The pic shows many different colors and weaves/ties and even says &#34;random&#34; colors.  I was disappointed to see that the ones sent were all identical in weave and almost identical in color, except some colors are in a different order.  Not what I thought--glad I only spent a few bucks.  :("
2.0,It's not good quality and not comfortable.
2.0,"Nice material, just extremely larger than expected according to size chart!"
2.0,Ugly as hell
2.0,"Really really really tried hard to like this. I styled it in a couple different ways, but the materal is weird feeling and the sleeves bother me.  I wanted it to fit oversized so I purchased up a size and maybe that was part of my issue. It just didn't sit nicely on me anywhere."
2.0,Fulfill the purpose that I needed but not the best quality in the world this was literally a one-time use and then throw it away
2.0,Cute but didn't fit well. It was no where near a 3X
2.0,"I loved this dress....until it shrunk in cold water and NOT even drying it. I would love to wear it again except I can’t. It comes to my rear end now. I’m only 5’2 so ladies that are tall, it’ll fit like a shirt.<br /><br />Hoping to return it."
2.0,"Costume was far too large for being labeled a small. The suspender straps were much longer in length than the torso of the dress, so even if it had fit properly alterations would be necessary to keep the straps taught and not loose and messy."
2.0,There comfortable
2.0,Not a 2XL more like a XL.
2.0,"[[VIDEOID:dfda689ce916a0053b17c3cd71b34073]] Poor quality, socks feel like tissue paper, wristlets don't fit and spread out. Kind of itchy. Cat ears awful. Not spaced out like cat ears, not shaped like them, poor headband. Itchy outfit. Uncomy. 4/10"
2.0,Fits smaller. Order a size up. But great product. Look amazing. Very clear.
2.0,The bag arrived and the image printed on the back was mirror reversed so the text is backwards. I didn’t realize it until after I gave it as a gift. 🥺
2.0,Thin material and runs small. Im a size 8 so I ordered a medium and it was way too tight. The material is thin and cheap as well.
2.0,Hand made! They appear to have been hand made by a person with black felt and a hit glue gun. The fur part isnt horrible. But the palms are awful! Very cheap. The lines where your fingers come through arent cut well and jagged. And the pads are crud cut out black felt that was simply hot glued on. Basically could have made them my self.
2.0,"The image wasnt even  accomodated to look good with the hat they just put the image extactly as sent and there is no option to explain to them how or only what part of the image was meant to be there. The hat is self is not really comfortable, I really thought it would be a great gift but came out as a great dissapointment instead."
2.0,"[[VIDEOID:3b0436703c81426be06fee7ce2fbfb9c]] I bought bc I needed replacements ASAP and I thought this was a steal 4 for $10 but they a cheaply made, started peeling and I had only been wearing it for two days."
2.0,Had to return it. The straps to the sandals were not the same length
2.0,It was not very good quality but the price does reflect this. I didn't like the trim on the see through part either.
2.0,"This robe is nothing special and certainly does not justify the ridiculous price tag! The price along with being an Oprah favorite, I expected much more. Shame on Oprah, I guarantee this is not in her closet."
2.0,"Kind of cheaply made, not true to size fit"
2.0,It was way too small.  Was really disappointed but I gave it too a much smaller  friend
2.0,Gift for Belize friend
2.0,Paper thin and huge!- Returned.
2.0,"I bought this under the assumption it wasn't paper thin and see through, yet here I am. I'm not sure what to do with it now as this was a last minute purchase for Halloween. Highly disappointed and I haven't even tried it on yet."
2.0,"When this arrived i was quite disappointed with the quality of the actual eye image. It looked like it was printed on a low pixel image, i think it would've looked better if they made the whole eye smaller. I also didn't realize it was made from a bottle cap, so it was sharp all around making me think it would easily cut you if you aren't careful when reaching for it. I purchased this for a friend who graduated from optometry school and to be completely honestly I don't think she realized it was an eye until I pointed it out to her."
2.0,Sizing chart does no justice. These shorts wouldn’t even clasp let alone zip and I’m 5’4 165lbs. I normally wear a Medium and probably would have to order an XL just for these to fit well. Measure above your belly button for accurate measurements since these are high waisted with no elastic. No idea why the item title says they are elastic.
2.0,"The size was a large and I’m fighting to wear it, while listening to little pops and tears of the fabric to give way as I put it on. I am a 34D, athletic build and a yoga teacher. The only reason why I haven’t thrown the bra out is because I’m curious as to whether the fabric will loosen up or it’ll stay like that. I’m giving it another month before it gets washed and donated."
2.0,The quality of the glasses are not great. I returned this product because I encountered resistance when adjusting the focus and it felt like it was about to break.
2.0,"The Naviforce watch looks good but the digital time is way out of sync with the analog time. While the analog portion is dead on for time keeping after the five days I've owned it, the digital portion is already five seconds slow."
2.0,"Runs small, thin see through material."
2.0,Looks cheapy I brought for my old mother.. it fitted good but I never buy it again.
2.0,The zipper broke after 2 wears. Seems to be made cheaply
2.0,Felt like an amazing steal but there's a catch... Green fingers on the first wear. Coat with clear nail polish to make sure they do not tarnish. Or remove when putting fingers in contact with moisture.
2.0,"The clips brackets on the top corners was not wide enough to accommodate my lens!  I had to straighten them and the re-bend, which is not a job for the faint of heart.  I am nearsighted, not severely tho', so my edges are thick but not as bad as some.  I have polycarbonate lenses, so the edges are not even as thick as glass lenses would be.  I don't understand why the sun clips would be made to not accommodate a wider variety of lenses."
2.0,Cute… but a get what you pay for situation.
2.0,"I very much like the design of these, as it's retractable, breakaway and works with my work badge. However, after less than a month the snap stopped working and my badge would just fall off the plastic loop. It's super-glued on at the moment."
2.0,"These didn't even make it up my legs all the way because my thighs were too big! Used the sizing chart and got an XL, but to no avail."
2.0,"This is a very light weight, perhaps even ""feather weight"" apron. I would not consider it sturdy at all. Sadly, I do not expect it to last more than a year of daily use. The adjustable cross back straps are too short (it barely fits me properly), and the front part is entirely too narrow for full coverage of your torso. It will do for now. The overall length of the apron is the only pro I can give. This is a prime example of ""you get what you pay for"". Invest in higher priced and better quality aprons of the same design. I really wanted to like this apron more than I do. I am petite in stature and it barely fits. How disappointing!"
2.0,Very difficult to snap to close. I was not impressed.
2.0,"Polyester with poorly sewn seams need to cut off multiple threads at seams , I haven’t worn it yet due to warmer than expected weather ."
2.0,"product is not as expected.  I order a medium, it was too large,  so I tried a small and it was too small. The small and the large were different material and colors from eachother. The product is inconsistent, and the time of delivery was inconsistent as well."
2.0,"Seems to be good quality, but way too heavy for me.  Also, sizing is too large."
2.0,IT WAS BADLY MADE ONE LENS STAY IN POSTION
2.0,The material is super stiff and when you wear it it just looks like a trench coat. Not flattering.  If it was different material that was heavier it would be flattering.  I have a red one just like this but good material and it looks great.
2.0,All my beads fell off the string..only had it 1 month
2.0,XL was way too small for my size 9 feet. Would not fit even my snug riding shoes. I returned them.
2.0,Not a very hard case at all.
2.0,"The dress fit well and was cute but the fabric was really thick cheap polyester. This looks like a summer dress but I would not want to wear this anywhere in hot weather... I would sweat right through it. This dress is also obviously different from the one in the picture because this dress has false buttons, meaning they are sewn closed, you can't unbutton them. Disappointed... returned it."
2.0,This is way to small.
2.0,Built in bra is very lumpy. No tummy control.
2.0,LOOKS DIFFERENT IN PERSON. I WILL DONATE IT
2.0,Order up a size..this runs really small. Color is beautiful.
2.0,"These socks worked well straight out of the package. However, 1st Time I washed and dried them they shrank."
2.0,The size was not true. I should have asked for the next size up.
2.0,I got them halfway up my butt and I had to pull them really hard to get them up the rest of the way they just wanted to stay halfway up my butt. Not real comfortable to wear them like that
2.0,"My kids have been wearing these since September and today the bottom fell off. The snaps also popped off as well, so we couldnt snap the fold into place anymore."
2.0,Way too small with no stretch! Ordered a size 5-6y for my 5 year old. Looks like it would fit my 2 year old.
2.0,"Was too small on the bottom, way too loose on the top!"
2.0,"The analog clock did not keep up with the digital time. Other than that, the watch works fine."
2.0,Very disappointed in these boots. They are very narrow and uncomfortable. The have no support. They look cuter line than in person. I think the are over priced. I expected more from Columbia.
2.0,This is my second order and I was very disappointed that these were too small. My first pair fit great but my second pair fit my daughter
2.0,Cute but huge
2.0,Very cheap looking plastic
2.0,"The print and materials were as expected; however, the quality is poor. Seam stitching was unraveling as I unfolded and inspected the dress. Runs small, not true size."
2.0,"First of all, don't be fooled by the picture of the watch - it does NOT have chronographs. What you see on there are cheesy decorations, not real functioning units. The set shows LOW quality and poor workmanship, and screams CHEAP all around. It may fool a child, but I'd be embarrassed sending this to anyone older than 15."
2.0,"the sizing is way off even at a large it was not made for anyone over 5'5"""
2.0,They have a beautiful look and they are soft as silk but they are not to sleep in. I tried sleeping in them 2 nights and both times they fell off my head.
2.0,Se despinta
2.0,"The dress is a t-shirt material so it's not very heavy/warm - the neck is also really tight so it's hard to get on over your head. I ordered a size small (I'm 4'10, 110 lbs) and I was swimming in it. I know I'm short but this dress came halfway down my calves and was super long on my arms. It was also super baggy, so it looked like I was wearing my six foot bodybuilder boyfriends t-shirt - but not in a cute way.<br /><br />I wish the dress was slightly more fitted as shown."
2.0,"I'm normally a medium so that is what I purchased.  They seem to be a little tight at first, but they stretched and were comfortable afterwards.  After 2 months of regular wash and wear, they're starting to develop holes at the seams.  I guess you get what you pay for. I doubt I will be buying anything else from this brand."
2.0,loved the charm but the bracelet had one end that was not hooked like the alex and ani ones and kept catching on my clothes and such.  I removed the charm and added it to my alex and ani bracelet.
2.0,"This looked very cute--cuter, in fact, that I thought it would, given the flimsy materials. And while it runs super small for US sizes, the listing does acknowledge that. I ordered according to the product size chart and it fit perfectly (I'm 5'4&#34;, 155, usually wear an 8 or a 10, and ordered the XL). Between that and the cuteness, I feel it deserves 2 stars.<br /><br />HOWEVER. The flimsy materials would prove its downfall. As a friend of mine said, shortly after I Hulked out of this dirndl *while at an Oktoberfest party*, simply by existing in it and bending over (let me remind you, it fit perfectly): &#34;Wow! It looks like they used a doll's zipper.&#34; It's true. The zipper looked like it might hold together doll clothing on a doll that didn't move around a lot. It should not, and indeed did not, hold together while an adult woman was carrying around fresh-baked pretzels, attempting to spread Oktoberfest joy. Amazon as always saved the day by issuing a refund so that I could invest in a dirndl made for adult human women instead.<br /><br />If you are a tiny doll-like sort of person who doesn't move a lot, this might be a great choice for you."
2.0,Wayyyyyyy too small and I went by the sizing chart even the size bigger was too small
2.0,"The quality is good for what the earrings are, but they sent the wrong size gauge. I was sent 12s when they were supposed to be 10s."
2.0,"This tape is not what I thought. Very thin. Does not have any backing on it. Does not stick good, without some glue. The sparkle comes off easily. Not happy."
2.0,nice fit over my glasses and these are much better made. I just wish it had lasted longer than a week 2nd pair broke same place as the first pair cheap plastic needs screws
2.0,there making them smaller than they use to!
2.0,you get what you pay for. it is definitely not the same print as the picture the spots are alot smaller so it almost doesn't look like leopard print just a spotted tie. it will get the job done but it is cheap. I would look at some other ties on amazon before purchasing this.
2.0,"This was super cute, I do feel they ran large. I returned it because I didn't like how the skirt part seemed too high. If it sat hip level I may have kept it."
2.0,Item is very light weight possibly made of tin. The loop that holds the chain is very fragile. The chain is a dog tag style chain or something you would find in a toilet. Overall not happy.
2.0,They are so cute but after 10 days one of the bees fell off.
2.0,"These seem to run small and the straps and bib part are too big so that even when pulling the straps up all the way, the top still hangs both in front and back. These are shaped for tall skinny folks. Disappointed."
2.0,"It did not fit him well, the shirt was way too large."
2.0,"I purchased them to use as metal coins in a board game. They are too thin and lightweight for my intended purpose, but my dissatisfaction is my own fault, not the product's. I'm keeping them because they are attractive and I may find another use for them soon. For what they are, they are attractive metal coins."
2.0,It's tight and short
2.0,Vents fall out
2.0,"I ordered these originally in a larger size they were awesome great quality and felt good, just too big<br />I returned them and ordered another pair in  the correct size, they arrived promptly and fitted well, except the quality was really not so good as the other. I think the price is way too pricey for the quality of the product."
2.0,"I liked the color and style but the waist band kept twisting and wouldn't lay flat. I am 5'5"" 130 lbs and the waist was uncomfortable."
2.0,"Nice plaid pattern and the scarf is very soft but it is definitely NOT beige! :( More of a dusty blue. Not going to match any of my fall wardrobe because of the blue so, sadly, it is going back."
2.0,Fabric wasnt really giving at all
2.0,It’s a beautiful dress but it’s wayyyyy too big around the stomach area but wayyy too small in the chest and shoulder area (and I have a pretty small chest and narrow shoulders) and it was super uncomfortable.
2.0,"It's a great product, I have a coworker that wears it every day to work. The size of this product is way to small. I'm going to return mine and purchase a bigger one."
2.0,"this product is not for men. I'm looking for a child or women to five this to, what a waste"
2.0,Daughter was dancing and strap broke/snapped off only after using shoes for at least 15 times.  It’s disappointing because they are so darn cute.
2.0,The heart is very cute but after putting it in my ear it was really hard to clasp.
2.0,Quality was very cheap. Garment runs small.
2.0,Material was very stiff color is beautiful
2.0,"Dress is cute in the picture, but fabric is not what I expected.  Although seemingly light weight in the package, once I put it on, it felt heavy and was being weighed down causing it to hang and could see the outline of my bra and bra straps."
2.0,Very thin cheap material. Will not wear it out of the house. Could be used as a swim suit cover up.
2.0,My kids found these uncomfortable and the inserts kept falling out.
2.0,Didn't work as hoped. Developed lots of blisters
2.0,Product arrived as pictured and is exactly what I was looking for but after only a few weeks of use all the color is rubbing off.  I’m disappointed that I’m going to have to replace it quickly.
2.0,The colors are rubbing off and I don’t shower with it at all.
2.0,"Nice workmanship; however, the size description was incorrect. This is smaller than indicated, so beware. I ordered same size (length) from another company, and it fits fine. This one, same size as competitors, is too small. Length is length, maybe they used a different ruler or something. Will not buy from this vendor again. very disappointed."
2.0,"First one broke when took out of package, don’t stay on very well and fall off easily"
2.0,It looked like a maternity dress.
2.0,They weren't anything special - just normal sunglasses.  No different from any I could have gotten from the drug store...
2.0,The material is very thin. The color is off. Red looks orange. I sending it back for a refund.
2.0,"I like the concept of this dress; 3-D butterflies all over it. The problem was, it runs small. Not just that, but it had a tight feel through the shoulder area. I loved the look of the red butterflies on the cream fabric. However, the fabric felt a little thin and cheap. Also, the sheer, outer layer of fabric, was much longer then the under dress, which looked awkward to me. Should have been a closer length to each other."
2.0,"So, this dress is made from the same material as my dog’s Halloween costume. Cheap, cheap, cheap. The seams didn’t line up, the lining was scratchy, and it was overall quite unflattering. Bummer."
2.0,poor quality but very cute. Mine broke after a few uses from taking it on and off.
2.0,Like the material it’s not stretchy and runs ridiculously small imma medium bought a large and it didn’t even close
2.0,I have a brown wallet like this one that I've had for a year and for some reason this white one is sooo tight you can't get your cards in & out in a decent time really sucks bc I love my other that I purchased from Dillard's... but it was 1/2 the price so... maybe that had something to do with it.
2.0,its ok but the magnetic tab to close it broke the very first week. and it doesn't have opening for ID pic
2.0,This wallet is cute but not functional at all. There is a pocket for change but no real pocket for cash
2.0,Top is very poorly hemmed. Wore it one night to sleep and the next morning it was almost all unhemmed in the breast area. The shorts and robe fine. Bought a large the top was smaller as well. Definitely size up
2.0,"Unless your child has a tiny head or likes his/her glasses pressed into his/her skull, these will be too tight.  I bought them for my 8 y/o Daughter to use during gymnastics.  She can't use them.  They grip really well and would work great for maybe an infant."
2.0,Not what I expected. Thin shiny material. Too short. Will be sending it back.
2.0,"The watch looked like the picture, however I wasn't to crazy about the texture of it. Also, the watch didn't turn on at all, so I had to return it."
2.0,These were too small. I typically wear a 16-18 and a 2x is more than enough but these were way too small. Also I ordered the mint green and what came is definitely a sky blue color.
2.0,The dimensions of this blouse aren't at all as pictured. It's much shorter than it appears. The arm holes are also a bit snug.
2.0,"I normally wear a medium but this was definitely too small. It was very tight in the chest area and a little short, which is saying something as I'm short waisted. I thought about ordering the large but was converted it would still be to short"
2.0,These did not fit at all.
2.0,Runs very small.  Get 2-3 sizes bigger
2.0,They hurt her heals when she walked.
2.0,I ordered a small and it was huge. Definitely runs way to big. The front of the blouse doesn't seem to hang right . returning
2.0,After two months and several application both while wearing and in a boot stretcher I could see and feel absolutely no change. They still hurt and water soaked in.
2.0,It's small.<br />Performance is below expectation.
2.0,These actually look like they are for men. They are bulky and they look huge!
2.0,The skirt is cute but took too long to ship to me. I wanted to return because it’s too small and revived an email saying that usually it’s just too much in shipping to return so I guess I’ll keep it. Make sure you really want it before you buy it that’s all.
2.0,Decent umbrella but top won’t screw in because top inside screw lines of pole are smashed in at an angle. :(
2.0,"Very heavy , it’s keeps falling off , but it made a cute cosplay photo shoot"
2.0,Cheap quality. It’s grimy and dingy and I’ve only had it a couple weeks. The original one lasted well over a year. Disappointed.
2.0,"I want to give this company the benefit of doubt but I e tried using this thing 3 times total.... as if the first one wasn’t enough, I want to say I must not do something right but in all honesty it’s not rocket science. All 3 times the same thing happens. Bike will end up getting hotter and hotter and after about 2-3 days of riding the weep hole has a drip. Meaning the seal went out again... like I said about 2-3 days later though so it did fix it for that many days...  but that’s not good enough. I’ll update this post once I try a different brand kit if it fixes the issue if not then I’ll presume there is some underlying other issue  causing this and not the kit"
2.0,"This shirt was cute but after the second time I wore it to work, it was already coming apart. At the chest, and the bottom, even the sleeves. (I work in an office, not anywhere that would tear and thread my clothes)"
2.0,not real happy with the ring kind of cheap looking but gave to my granddaughter for dress up she love's it
2.0,"Tiny, cheap looking. Nothing like the picture. I returned it."
2.0,"I purchased both the pendant and the earrings thinking they would look like the picture on the website.  The pendant is okay,, BUT the earrings do NOT reverse.  It shows them facing the other way on the website But according to the company selling them they do NOT reverse... I wished they had stated that on the description, I would NOT  have bought those earrings.  The only explanation I got was that the earrings dangle and move???  HUH.... do you have to stand on your head to see the faux coral?????"
2.0,"I have to agree with many other reviews and say that this was too large in the chest with no support. The waist was tight and the chest was big. I’m nursing right now, so my breasts are larger than usual, so I was going to try and make it work, but it just wasn’t flattering at all. The quality was okay, but the fit is why I didn’t like it."
2.0,Nice design fits extremely large. I am 165 and 5ft 7 usually wear xl shirts but this is crazy big!
2.0,Not well made!
2.0,Does not run true to size.. Way too small..
2.0,"I ordered a extra large, the top doesn't fit my breasts well I'm a 36 D, the back would have been better with extra clasps or buttons, At least I can wear it in public unlike the other top I ordered from the same vendor."
2.0,"Another fail for the wide calf community. Im so curious as to who they measure when companies love to say “wide calf” because it seems to be an endless search for many women to find boots that aren’t too tight and also fashionable. These were way too snug. WAY too snug. Seemed like it fits like any other normal boot. Could barely zipper bottom. And the shoe itself runs 2 sizes too small. Im normally a size 10, ordered an 11 and toes were scrunched up tight and super narrow. Just sad to see companies still don’t know how to use people with actual wide calves before they make products, it seems to me their just assuming what that is to them. For reference my calves are 16 inches."
2.0,The back lack was way too loose. Almost uncomfortable to wear. Returned.
2.0,1 pack of thin 'socks' for $7.99<br />Easy to misinterpret headline (and I read it at least 3 times)<br />Make sure you choose the 3 pack (in picture - lower section of ad)<br />Not a good deal - at all
2.0,No me gusto. Es demasiado grande y la tela no es bonita
2.0,"While These Boots are very cute they did not stay on my son's foot ,the bottom sole is very flexible, I even ordered my son a size up but for some reason his feet won't stay inside of the boot they are very cheaply made. And my son has very thin and narrow feet, and also they tore up very easily after wearing them a couple times the bottom started to come off"
2.0,Liked the style run small
2.0,"I have 3 other pairs of Danskin Now's Bermuda with pockets, and the quality has gone down.<br />It has an odd fit, one leg is off, and they swam on me."
2.0,"I really like Fossil, however when the watch was sent it barely worked. It would start and stop. I needed a battery but I paid for a brand new watch."
2.0,Not good. I wear a 2x and ordered a 4x and was too snug. Material is like of spun plastic. Does not feel natural and is not breathable. If you stretch the material it looses it color and looks white. Would not recommend.
2.0,Run small......not able to wear them
2.0,Ordered a large. Think this was a medium. Arms tight and way too short
2.0,"Very disappointed! I immediately knew this was mostly polyester, doesn't breath, is absolutely NOT 100% cotton as it says in the specifications. If that doesn't matter to you it is a cute design, fit is nearly as sizing describes, but I returned it the same day I got it."
2.0,cute but the stitching is very noticeable and wrong at places.
2.0,The lining is makes your skin itch! Made with cheap fabric. Also the strap in the back broke before i had a chance to wear.
2.0,Just was too small.
2.0,Weird fit. The thighs and hips are like oddly long and tight I don't usually wear a large I got bigger just to be baggy and they are skin tight only around the thigh.
2.0,"I have never has this problem before, but the glasses seem a bit too small for my face and they keep sliding down my nose, forcing me to push them back up every 10 seconds (especially if i am eating)<br /><br />Kind of feel like i wasted my money. They look cool, but won't stay on my face."
2.0,I thought i was ordering alex and ani disappointed by size
2.0,"La tela es mala, se comenzó hacer huecos en la parte del estómago."
2.0,"The tear in the knee is obnoxious and distracting, couldn't do it. Also runs a bit on the small side."
2.0,The jean like material feels durable and the construction seems solid but the large zippered pocket in the center makes finding anything on either side of it impossible. This design might work with a bag that is not as deep but with this it's total frustration.
2.0,"This might be an okay band, but I had two issues. One, the sizing pins are in so tight that I had to use pliers to pull them out once I got them started. I should be able to push them out using my watch tools and fingers alone. I absolutely mangled one of the pins trying to get it loose.<br /><br />Second—and the issue that’ll cause me to return the band—is that the clasp can’t be securely closed because there’s not enough clearance where the two sides meet in the middle to snap in place. Having had many watch bands, I figured this was because there was some protective plastic in the way, but nope. It was clear that wasn’t the case once the plastic was off."
2.0,These masks are so thin you can easily see right thru them. They are cute but need to wear two at a time or a filter. No way three ply.
2.0,The hat wouldnt sag down like a normal beanie.... it stook up like an elf... I dont wanna look like an elf .. if u have any tips on how to sag it plz tell me and ill rate it higher
2.0,"Item was not at all as it appeared in photo.  Cheap, see- through 'long underwear' material. I will literally never wear this"
2.0,"It was totally strange with the underwire in it - I thought since I wear underwire bras it would be okay, but it wasn't.  And it just fit weird, so I returned it.  Good luck..."
2.0,I ordered a 2X and the shirt was about a medium.  My co-worker loves it.
2.0,"This product runs small, if you want baggy order 2-3 sizes up. I ordered a large thinking it would be baggy because I usually wear a medium and it fitted like a small."
2.0,Not as glowing blue in the picture. Still nice.
2.0,Looked very cheap and not like they'd hold up well
2.0,snugg
2.0,Like to look but walking wise can be a challenge
2.0,"For the first time I'm disappointed.  I thought these earrings would be about one inch in diameter at most.  They are huge.  I donated to the Discovery Shop, charity that sells items and with funds helps cancer victims."
2.0,Looks better on screen
2.0,I ordered extra large but its way too small.
2.0,I really like them but I've almost lost them3 times... I gave to constantly check and adjust them. Not worth wearing them just to lose them.. really disappointibg
2.0,"It's very cute and is exactly as depicted, HOWEVER it runs VERY small. This skirt is NOT meant for anyone with a butt. I've got a decent amount of ""junk in the trunk"" and it stopped right at my butt... Couldn't get it past the hump. Disappointed. I even went up a size to be safe."
2.0,Touchscreen doesn't work at all! :( and the color is not like in the picture. Gloves are nice but expensive for what I have received!
2.0,"Maybe I am just bigger than I thought. But I am size 14 and I ordered an XL and a no. It fit, but was tighter than I felt comfortable with wearing. IDK. Maybe it just wasnt for me, but could be for the next."
2.0,"The bottoms were HUGE and the top was tiny. I am convinced that I was sent two separate sizes - if not, then it was a horrible fit."
2.0,It wasn’t too small. I fit more like their was a stitching error.
2.0,"I read the reviews by other purchasers, so I ordered XXX-L instead of my usual XL.  My daughter, who wears size 4, can wear these pants comfortably.  They look on her like they look on the model.  They will stretch enough to go on me (size 18), but they are uncomfortably tight."
2.0,"The side and back pockets bunch up and don't lay flat under the top layer of fabric.  Because the fabric is so thin, the bunches are very noticeable and make the skirt unattractive.  Too bad, because the style is very flattering."
2.0,Nice ring but the ring has a huge crack. Not sure how it happened. My husband only had it for two months. He takes it off when he goes to work.
2.0,Nice in picture but real crap!
2.0,The upper part of this dress is just very awkward and the bra cups sit very high on the chest. Felt like my breasts were actually resting below the bottom of the cups.
2.0,Doesn’t stay latched under belt. Love the look and price but hate to lose my watch!!
2.0,"meh, just what I figured it would look like.  I should have known better than to buy cheap.  Finish was scratched within a week and it went into the trash."
2.0,Very small and poor quality...I ended up donating it.
2.0,"Bought this tape to adjust the size of a stetson fedora. I spent a lot of time trying to peel the adhesive tape without success. I tried using a knife. Still, no luck."
2.0,These look terrible close up.  The coating is streaky and uneven.  They're large and clunky.  One of the posts is even a little crooked.
2.0,Next time I will purchase a wider one. This thing is painful and it rolls down.
2.0,"The hook is a little too sharp on the skirt especially for a toddler. And while trying the outfit on, the hook came off. Wasn’t expecting that."
2.0,"zipper was broken, it wouldnt go up and I am thin so it wasnt my weight.. it would have looked nice otherwise, kinda cheap looking, but you can make it work if you try."
2.0,Returned due to sizing.
2.0,These pants aren't for medium/long legs!!!
2.0,Awful smell to them. I have been airing them out for a month and still smell. Haven't put them on my babies head yet<br />:(
2.0,Cut little hippie dress but they run small. Go up two sizes.
2.0,"It's a pretty set and the delivery was right on time. However, the set is actually much smaller than pictured. It wasn't quite what was hoping for so I will be returning it."
2.0,Didn't work for me. Pretty though
2.0,"It's way longer on me than it is on the model (I'm 5'6), but I think I can maybe have it tailored.  I hate the material (t's super thin/stretchy), but will be keeping it because it does fit and doesn't look horrible I guess.  I wouldn't buy it again or recommend it."
2.0,It was too big and baggy
2.0,already sending it back tomorrow.  Sorry wasn't made correct for what I needed
2.0,"Definitely a crop top. Which is what I wanted, but the neckline was too high. I want to show some skin in a crop top, and it was weirdly full coverage in the front. Back was pretty cute with the bow and button. Overall just hit me at weird places, so I returned it."
2.0,Shrank a lot the first time washed. Only worn once before it was too small.
2.0,"The necklace is cute but oh man does it tangle.  It rolls constantly during the day and gets super tangled and wrapped together.  I have to take it off a few times a day to straighten it out.  It also gets tangled up in your hair, ouch!  All in all it was a good price but just doesn’t seem to work right for me."
2.0,This watch is so complicated to set up. Then my son dishes with the buttons and all its lost again. Not worth $30
2.0,Very small on bust and I'm a super small B cup and 118lbs. It rode tightly up my crotch and does not have underwire like it shows so it's not very flattering imo. Not very happy with this purchase.
2.0,One had missing stones.  It's cheaply made and they get by selling it without refunding your $ because they charge  1cent for it and then $7 shipping.  NOT WORTH $7!!!
2.0,Too small and the product has lower quality than I was expecting.
2.0,Very thin material and it runs big.
2.0,Extremely small! I ordered a medium and can barely get it up my thigh. I followed the sizing chart but the product did not follow the sizing guidelines. The quality is fine enough but I can't wear it because of the size...<br />I'm very disappointed by the sizing. I won't be able to wear this with my wedding dress.<br /><br />Return instructions are not clear English so it's very difficult to understand.
2.0,Fits very loosely. ..doesn't stay in place very well.
2.0,"I was sent the wrong color, the material wasn’t what I expected to be."
2.0,"Unlike Birkenstock shoes these were very narrow, therefore I will be able to wear them"
2.0,Very small arrow!
2.0,Was not great quality
2.0,"Loved the color of this dress but it was way too short.  I am 5'6"" and 150lb.  I ordered the medium and it was about 4 inches from touching the floor without shoes on."
2.0,Pants are good quality but I recieved the wrong pants
2.0,The product photo is very clearly not the outfit I received. This material is cheap and sheer. The top is very poorly made and not symmetrical at all. I am getting my money because this is a disappointment! I almost never leave negitive reviews but this needs it as clearly there positive reviews are fake. The only upside to this outfit it I got a cute photo and it does fit true to size but you could never wear this in public<br /><br />It won't let me add a photo but the top is not made symmetrically and the bottom is completely sheer. Save yourself the money
2.0,IF THIS IS LEATHER IT IS VERY STIFF & UNCOMFORTABLE.  STILL DON'T KNOW HOW TO SET THE DATE. IT LOOKS NICE & THAT'S ABOUT IT. PLUS IT IS GUARANTEED.
2.0,. I ordered a size up for  my chest but the hips are too tight.  The material is soft and comfortable but the don't order if you have hips.
2.0,"My partner is a drummer - he's a big guy, but this thing was way too small - it's even too small for me.  What a rip off.  It's like a child's size!"
2.0,The clasps after a few weeks broke
2.0,The material is thinner than I would have expected and the legs are too short. I’m wearing these as pajamas.
2.0,"I usually wear a S sometimes even XS and my boobs aren't that big (32b) but the dress (i bought size S) was still too small to cover half my breast. There is thin lining on the inside of the dress but even with the lining the dress is still pretty see through so the lining is pretty much useless.... I'm pretty disappointed with the fit, the waist and length was perfect, but i don't know if I can even wear it out if my nips can't be covered........"
2.0,I bought the shorter version of these shorts and loved them... this pair not so much. They are not flattering and give you a muffin top but also squeeze too much in the legs. They also aren't the most comfortable. They are not the worst though for the cost.
2.0,Ordered the size I normally wear and it was way too small around bust. Cute dress though.
2.0,"This dress has so much extra fabric on the sides it made y hips look huge. I'm 5 ft, 100 pounds and it makes me look way bigger than I am. Not a fan!"
2.0,The watch and face is small and the clasp is not very secure but as expected for price
2.0,"This dress is nice, but it's not shiny or glamorous, good quality material but not an evening gown. I ordered the chart size but it was too small. I should have ordered a size larger. I'm 5'3, 140lbs a little thick in the belly... I normally wear a Med should have ordered a Large."
2.0,It was just too much dress. When I went to return it I had to print the labels and I dont have a printer and I wasn't going to go to the library.
2.0,I bought 3 of the same size 2xl polo style shirts from the same ad. Of which one fits very well. The other two. Who knows?
2.0,"The material is much thinner. In the picture the bottom hem looks slightly ruffled it is not it is just edged with a stitch. The top part in the picture looked ruffled, the garment at the top part is lace. The 3 dangling strips look stupid, but can be trimmed short with out damaging the stitching if your careful. Well a thong does not have much to is as is the one that comes with it though has a tiny tiny triangle of fabric. The garment may hold up for a few wears, and careful washing's."
2.0,"These work but I had to cut them off of my jeans after pregnancy.  And they were a HUGE pain to get on in the first place.  I wish they had a little give in them (they are a very, very hard plastic) so they would last.  I would say these would work if you were just having a bloated day but they are unrealistic for much else."
2.0,"To be fair, I did wear these a good amount in 4 months, but not enough to justify the strap already pulling out.  I've had shoes I've worn for 10 times more and they never broke.<br /><br />Decent price, very comfortable and stylish, but be prepared to keep replacing them every few months of use."
2.0,The material is scratchy and rough.
2.0,"Bought these to use with my indoor bike. They’re pretty see-through, so I would avoid these if you want them for riding outdoors. Padding is just ok. My biggest annoyance is that the description on these said the legs have silicone anti-slide belt...they do NOT. They were riding up the whole time."
2.0,Ordered the small but it's a little snug on my daughter so I get to wear it. 😁 comfy shirt but you may want to order one size up.
2.0,Flimsy fabric..
2.0,Decent quality for price.  Would have kept it but it is way too short for a dress for my long legs and didn't look good over leggings.
2.0,Pretty but it starts to rust and get a orangey metallic tint to it quick. Maybe worth 7 or 8 dollars definitely not 20 if I knew that was going to happen .
2.0,The flags with 2 small and they float around I didn't know they was that small
2.0,"I really liked this bracelet, but the charm fell off the third time I wore it and I lost it."
2.0,"I bought this hat because I have Lyme and I needed to keep the sun off my face during the summer and I'm a strange person so I thought I would wear this hat. It is cheaply made, with a single feather and a legit little puff ball on the front (like the pom pom balls for arts and crafts) the whole thing is hot glued together. I would not recommend this, nor will I buy it again. But because this is only to keep the sun off my face it will do its job. IDK if I can wear it public due to the pom pom ball on the front."
2.0,There is not a size to describe this flannela is not like the picture I ordered big because i like not to stock to the body also I like Long almost under the hips. But this is too short and too big... I didn't like it
2.0,Incredibly tight and a bit indecent. Was disappointed since I really wanted a shirt with a bunch of eyeballs staring at people.
2.0,"Fits a little large, to he fair it is shown laid out. The maim thumbnail has a significantly smaller logo or the model is a giant."
2.0,Loved it once I got it but it kept falling apart. The last time the screw fell and I could not find it. So needless to say I only got to wear for a short time. Not a good quality
2.0,"The polka dots on this are retro-cute, but overall, I don't like this jumpsuit.  I'm fairly short, but even on me, this is very short-waisted. When I first tried it on, I wondered if maybe I didn't pay enough attention to the photos on the product page, and it was really supposed to be empire-waisted.  But no -- on the models, it looks like it sits at the waist.  But being either too high (or too low if it were supposed to be empire), it looks just kind of dumpy.  The stitching is not very good and mine has bits of thread sticking out here and there.  The stitching is rather crude, especially starting below the (supposed to be) waist and through the legs.<br /><br />The loop is stretchy and hard to find.  It's not hard to unhook but it's very hard to hook, and if you are a typical female who wears this for the day, you are going to have to unhook it multiple times a day - avoid coffee.<br /><br />The polyester can be hot but the legs are loose enough so that it doesn't feel as hot as if it had slimmer legs.  It is, as it claims, cut quite deeply in the front, so a low-cut bra is needed.<br /><br />I thought this would be a fun outfit and I didn't expect fabulous quality, but I expected better than this."
2.0,"We've purchased leos from Gem Gear in the past, so we knew to go BIG in the sizing - an XL for my 8 year old who is generally in the 8-10 range.  The fit was as expected since we had gotten the larger one.<br />My biggest concern with this leo? It is COVERED in glitter.  Glitter which comes off - on warm up clothes, the seat of the car, the equipment in the gym, and ends up in the laundry, even if you hand wash it as recommended.  Red glitter everywhere.  Returned after one wear - couldn't take the glitter overload!"
2.0,Not exactly quality materials. Very flimsy!
2.0,"Out of the 6 pair, 2 of them were clearly the wrong size with the right size label. The size ran a little small but doable. However, I was overall disappointed in the fact that I paid for quality garments and received sub par quality. Will not buy these ever again and I would not recommend it for others."
2.0,Too small to be comfortable in
2.0,"Ordered these to use them as lounge sweats and that they were not. I am 6'1&#34;/195lbs with a 34/34 pants size. I ordered large because Mediums were up to waist 33 and Large were up to waist 37. Needless to say the larges were super short, the bottoms were well above my ankles and there was no way I was going to return them for an extra large just for the waist to get way bigger for a few extra inches on the leg.<br />On top of them not fitting the material was not stretchy at all they wer very hard to move in. They weren't very comfortable, definitely not built for lounging or athletic wear."
2.0,"Fit fine when I got it, shrunk to the point that it's now a half shirt on me. Never again."
2.0,"Very uncomfortable, too tight at the arch of the foot."
2.0,"Item says waterproof it is not. The photo appears to be a brush it’s hard plastic. You must apply a thick line for lashes to hold, but doesn’t hold well bc comes out with slighting water. And not powerful like other liners"
2.0,Not correctly sized. Gift for a friend with 00 ears and all of these were too small
2.0,Very very cheap watch. It looks nice and works.
2.0,"I have bought one or two shirts every year for my husband. We both loved them, but I won't buy them anymore.<br /><br />I always got him XL, and they always fit great (and felt and looked super). This one shirt barely went around him and could not even be buttoned. The second one, in a different color, fit perfectly. I wrote and told them the one had been mismarked and would like to exchange it for one that was the proper size. Since they said they had no others, I could only get a refund. However, they wanted ME to PAY to return the shirt. I did, but their greedy rule cost them a longtime customer. When I told Amazon what happened, Amazon paid me back. Hooray for them, but that did not save Luxury Lane."
2.0,Disappointed that it’s tight on me. I thought it was going to be a loser fit. I ordered the blue stripe. I’m not crazy about the pattern or the material.  Also didn’t get a receipt to return it.
2.0,I love love bebe sunglasses. Im a loyal customer. I own 6 pairs. Not just bought from Amazon. I buy them from different places. However this is the first pair im disappointed in. When I got them I put them on and they are loose fitting. Its like someone with a big big head put them on and stretched them out. They fall off my face. Im thinking I might give them to my friend.
2.0,"Cute dress, just didn't fit right. The sleeves were super tight and way too long. Had to return it."
2.0,They don’t stay on when baby crawls
2.0,The fit in the bust was weird. The padding wasn't big enough and you could see every little seam and line through the top of the suit. Maybe a bigger size would have fixed that issue- but I found a different suit I liked better. I liked the length of the suit- but the fit was just a little too snug on top.
2.0,the plastic cover over clock itself breaks easily when adjusting time
2.0,Very thin not thick at all I hope it lasts long I just recieved it yesterday
2.0,"too small, cheap material - had to return."
2.0,Loved the bracelet- super cute but broke on the second week of use... not a great quality. Bummer- lost it...
2.0,I do not have large hands or wrists and the part that goes around the wrist broke almost immediately. I purchased two for my costume and was only able to wear one.
2.0,"The quality seemd good at first, but the fabric is just too stiff, and the elastic ear strips snapped when i was trying to loosen the thing that tightens it.  Unfortunately these don't cover my nose and chin at the same time, and the stiff fabric doesn't help.  These would be perfect for someone small though."
2.0,Terrible quality. Uncomfortable to wear.
2.0,Cute shirt but I ordered a small and it’s huge on me.
2.0,I really wanted to like these socks but it just didn't work out.  I didn't realize my toes were still going to be cold with the heating element on the bottom of the foot. I purchased them for running in cold weather. First of all they were too big for my women's size 5 feet and so they bunch up in the shoes.  The heating elements were under the feet so when I run I can feel the wires on the balls of my feet when my feet strike the pavement. That made it uncomfortable and almost painful after about a mile into my run. I decided I can use them for walking but it didn't make a difference.  The heating element works and gives off pretty good heat at the highest level.
2.0,The fabric is to stiff.
2.0,Nice quality until the balls started to fall off after wearing only once. (one on top and one from one side of flap)
2.0,I am not sure what these are made of but the ones I got are discolored and they are so small u can't really tell they are suns.
2.0,The chain is way too short.....I thought I had ordered 30”
2.0,"Wish i would have listened to the other guy. Yes, they look good. And yes, the sizing is way off."
2.0,It's not the size  I ordered and the quality is not good.Too flimsy for a duffle bag.The metal part on the strap is too thin to support the weight of the bag.
2.0,"4.0 Version is made in Hong Kong! The LUME Pip at 12 on my Watch was defective and did not illuminate. I contacted the seller and he said all the other 4.0 models in stock had weak LUME at the 12 Pip.<br /><br />In comparison, my Tissot PRS 516 model T100.430.11.051.00 is Swiss Made and of much higher quality at a lower price."
2.0,It’s a lot bigger than expected. I have big wrists but wow
2.0,"Unless you have thin skin, these will not work. I'm not sure if they cannot make the magnets stronger or these are just inferior, but out of the 3 girls (women) we tied these on, none worked."
2.0,"The color was more pink than burgundy, it was sheer and far shorter than it looks in the photo."
2.0,"It is a beautiful ring, but it has a flaw underneath. The bottom of the stone has an area that looks to have not been polished all the way or it was cut by accident. It is a flat area where everything else is an edge. Hoping the replacement one is not the same.<br /><br />***Update, I decided to not reorder, but keep the other yellow beryl I ordered by Silvershake. Smaller stone, but lovely ring.***"
2.0,The clasp broke when I tried to put it on.
2.0,"These things should have been bought at a dollar store , they r so cheaply made . They have an awful plastic smell that I am worried will sink up my entire suitcase.  Do not purchase these spend the extra cash and get something nicer !!!!"
2.0,Size was not accurate. They were to small.
2.0,"The watchband got a lot of attention from people, and I really enjoyed wearing it's message. However, the overall quality was not good. To start, you can tell that it is an image somehow applied on top of a white band. You will see the white on the edges of the watchband when you wear it. The image is not clear and crisp. The ""Love is Love"" appears a bit fuzzy (note, it is not the photos attached that are unclear, but the watchband itself). In addition, the image on the longest section of the band appears to be crooked. This may not matter to some, but it does speak to the overall quality. I wore the band for maybe 10-12 days before the pin that holds the strap in place just completely fell off. In that short time, the image itself began wearing off the watchband. For me, this was the shortest use I have ever gotten out of a watchband. I am disappointed."
2.0,"This is not a quality soft material, is a see through. Be advised thag thus is a poor quality made and also might  be good for underlayer in cold weather."
2.0,"Returned. Leaked for me, but then I've had a lot of trouble finding new goggles that don't leak, for me. Stick with my old ones! I didn't like the harder texture of the frame of these either."
2.0,did not fit as expected...but it was a great product
2.0,Love the style but they arrived with a lens already popped out. I can put it back in but it falls out sporadically. They feel super flimsy. I do like the adjustable nose piece. Still like them but wish they didn't arrive broken.
2.0,"Used the chart, ordered size up and they are still too snug! Also they’ve managed to come off while swimming."
2.0,"I bought these for my 13 year old son and his new swim season. I loved the seeming quality and he loved the style and function. He wore them for two practices and the bucket broke at the back strap. I don't think this was his rough use, but rather a design flaw. The plastic at the buckle seems to fragile and brittle for its function."
2.0,I ordered beige. The bag says beige but the hat is pale pink. It doesn't look as pink as the pink picture either. Here's a pic next to my cream colored scarf. It does not look at all like the picture. Fits well. Is thick and soft. Smells bad but I guess febreeze could help that. Wondering if the wrong color was sent to me. ?
2.0,"I ordered a large, in which is what I usually wear, this too small and fits too tight."
2.0,"Came with a hole in the pocket and a seam starting to let go in the neck, haff it for a while before i wore it. Hopefully can still return.  I also bought some of the same dress from other vendors that were perfect."
2.0,MAs que L parece XL
2.0,This was very small.
2.0,"I bought this dress in white to try some dyeing techniques, but it's so sheer I don't think dyeing it will help. The fabric is thin and rather flimsy."
2.0,"It fit all of the numbers, but what you can't tell from the description is that the underwires in this suit are made for a B-C cup person. I am not. I am a 40DD, and although the suit fit right everywhere else, I couldn't wear it no matter what because the underwires were digging into my skin. It was actually painful. The patter what gorgeous though, and if I had a smaller cup size, this would be perfect. But they don't really tell you that when they just give you a measurement of the chest."
2.0,The strap design was broken upon arrival. Other people comlained that it fell off or was damaged but I was hoping that wouldn't happen in my case. I was wrong. Returned.
2.0,"The size description is not very clear, therefore you will end up most probably with a product not really fitting. The size is supposed to be the hip size (I guess), but definitely comes smaller. The pockets would be wonderful - large, many - but then it is called a Tactical skirt, isn't it? Well, for being a tactical skirt it's way too short, being roughly 17&#34; long: So I had to return it, although I like the concept very much."
2.0,"Way to loose, slide right off my face ( never had this happen before. Cheap looking as well"
2.0,The cup size for the small is way too big for “A” or probably even a “B” cup…the strap under the bra did absolutely nothing either.  I’m going to give it to my daughter to see if it fits her better before it goes to Goodwill.
2.0,"This has a very clingy fit, so it is not flattering on me. It is long and would look good with leggings for smaller women. The fabric is very thin and likely won’t last longer than a season with regular wear. The color looks as shown"
2.0,It keeps on blocking my face.  The brim can't stand.  It's too soft and too floppy.  Not recommended
2.0,"I'm 5'10&#34; 170 lbs and got a size XL for length and it was still far too short. Ended up hemming it and got a cute shirt out of it, but still wish I had my velvet dress :("
2.0,"Foam does not bounce back.  It collapses after several uses.  For the price they are ""ok"" slippers."
2.0,"I ordered the white one and the trim on it is black, throwing off the look of the whole cover up.  But I like the style enough to keep it still."
2.0,Lasted 1 day. My daughter still wears what is left and likes it BUT..... it is not what she was hoping for.  The Pearl did not fit so she superglued it in place. The next day the Pearl was gone and now she wears an empty Pearl cage around her neck.
2.0,"I got the red shorts.  The cut is flattering to the ""package"" in front (when not wet!  dry suit only!) because the material is so light that anything ""pushing out forward"" is noticed - so that was a plus BUT once the material gets wet all bets are completely off.  The material is so light and ill suited for swimwear that, and I mean this literally, you can tell if someone is circumcised when these shorts get wet - twig and berries for all to see - not cool.<br /><br />And I also got the medium size but they fit like daisy dukes - I'm 5'8 with a 31"" waist and so I ordered the medium since I fall under medium - any sense of ""shorts"" here (that is to say, the sense that one is wearing shorts with material creating short legs) is almost gone when wearing these since they feel more appropriate for a gay club go go dancing in a cage rather than your local public swimming pool.<br /><br />Big disappointment."
2.0,Used purse for a wedding. I thought it was a burgundy color. The actual is red so didn’t match my dress. The clasp to close the purse broke! Trying to close the purse and it broke. I didn’t have much inside the purse either and the clasp broke!
2.0,They are really cute but some of them came broken.
2.0,"&#34;Value&#34; means nothing if the product lacks quality. Cotton is thin & rough to the touch. The socks run small, and the heels aren't high enough to stay up. Would rather spend a little more for a better product."
2.0,My girlfriend bought me these boots for my birthday in October. I only ever wore them out on weekends when we would go shopping and whatnot and they're already falling apart in December. The heel of the boot is split in half and the leather material is pulling apart. I wish these were made better because they're so cute and I absolutely loved them.😔
2.0,"Poor quality, not color shown and ordered. Saying and picture on back blurry. Very disappointed. This was going to be a gift for best friend who is battling breast cancer.  Shipped from foreign country. Now I cannot purchase the size I need from the original company."
2.0,"I am 5’6” 135 lbs and ordered a small. The fit was perfect, snug but not obnoxiously so. The material was soft but thin and a bit cheap feeling. I had to trim off lots of thread at the seams. Overall ok for what I paid."
2.0,"One was missing out of the pack. I didn't return it at the time because I figured the other three would be enough, but the tops unscrew easy and will get lost. I've already had that happen. These will not last long."
2.0,Was really expensive and only the tail was real fur.  But overall I would order again.  I used it for a party.
2.0,Loose but it's not flattering unless your a stick
2.0,Will keep...not worth shipping back...very cheap made and would fit a little 5 y/o...I am 5/5 110..small is tiny...I usually wear XS..have a 33-34 hips!
2.0,Absolutely does not have adjustable straps. Had to send back.
2.0,"These are cheaply made, but use a lightweight material. Sizing is off, however you could probably find a size that fits.<br /><br />The main flaw in these pants (and in many cheaper China made pants on Amazon) is their weird cut. In particular, they seem to try and save on the material in the butt area :) So, they cut the interior seam under an acute angle, such that the pants permanently give the wearer a wedgie (and I am not even particularly well endowed in that respect :) ).<br /><br />Not comfortable and not a good look."
2.0,"Material is too thin, size was too large. Returning."
2.0,"I absolutely loved this when I got it and wore it the first time. Unfortunately, it is coming apart at the seams after just one wear. It will be simple to fix on my sewing machine, but it's a pain and should hold up better than that. Buyer beware!"
2.0,The back seam pattern did not patch. For the money it was an OK purchase.
2.0,Broke after first time wearing returned
2.0,"These slippers would be perfect but... 1. the heel needs something stiff to be sown in, the fabric is very soft, and does not give much of a support needed for baby's foot, 2. the velcro is not strong enough, and the straps keep getting off."
2.0,Loved the look but the pattern and roughness irritated my ear within 4 days of having it in. Edges are sharp too and it was tricky to get in
2.0,The yellow was a weird off yellow and kinda good but looked cheap and the clasp magnet was cheap and I didn’t trust it would stay on so I sent it back
2.0,Shirt was very nice but the castle is a cheap press on decal. We got the shirt today and it's already got some defects in the decal.
2.0,I purchase this in White in XL. I was really disappointed when I received it because I already have the black one in XL and love it.  The top was too small to zip up. The lace was also almost ivory while the rest of the fabric was a true white with almost a blue cast to it. The combination looked awful. Had to return.
2.0,"All the black external  &#34; titanium&#34; layer rubbed off after about 4 months, looks like a dull pewter now. However, real titanium for the price I paid would have been surprising."
2.0,It is easy to wear and comfortable. But it easily came undone if bumped. If it wasn't past the return window I would send it back.
2.0,I went off the measurements in the size chart and it was still too small.
2.0,The dresses are ok but I got two of the same dresses!!! I was a bit disappointed with them shipping out two of the same grey dresses !! This really was not as described so that's why I have given 2 stars ! The material appears to be polyester so you get what you pay for . I wouldn't recommend these however.
2.0,"I like the style, fit and price of this jacket, but what ruined it for me is the hood. It's too small which looks dumb first of all, and secondly invalidates the whole purpose of a rain jacket. If my head and face aren't covered sufficiently then what's the point? Also wearing glasses unprotected in the rain is a hassle, you glasses wearers know what I mean. Returned for something that fulfills its purpose."
2.0,"I really don’t know how to review this dress. It’s beautiful and more than I expected, except I can’t get it on my daughter. It has a zipper on one of the seams on the side, but even with that completely down I can’t get both arms in the arm holes without it really hurting her. I’m going to have to open up the back of the dress and sew buttons on it so that she will be able to wear it."
2.0,"I never got to even try it on. I unzipped it and the zipper completely broke apart. It appeared to be made of plastic, not even metal. I had to return it. It is a shame, because it was very soft and looked nice otherwise."
2.0,Only fits Walmart brand of the 18inch dolls. They do NOT fit actual American Girl dolls. They are too small and don’t fit on wrist of real AG dolls
2.0,The material is quite stiff and it feels very homemade. I guess you get what you pay for though
2.0,Nice but dress was not as described.  It goes to knee not a midi as advertised.  Not worth paying to send it back but disappointed
2.0,Pretty chintzy but it was cheap so I won't complain too badly.  The lace ripped first day and the thin pads inside aren't symmetrical.  I basically wore it twice and then threw it away.
2.0,The toe box is too long on this shoe. The band is too far back. It would’ve been a nice shoe.
2.0,These are a loose fit and the lenses are so dark making it difficult to see unless your in the direct sun.
2.0,TIGHT - not what I needed !
2.0,"I really loved the flow of this dress ,but I’m 5 feet and 123 pounds, it was just way to big for me !!! I bought the army green and it was not the right color for me . I may reorder it in the navy and have it altered to give it another chance !! Also it is extremely see through!! Definitely need a slip"
2.0,"Bought this because I thought it was super cute and it is, I bought it a size bigger for my baby to grow into it as she’s only 2 months at the moment. I washed the onsie and the tutu but not the bib. I put the bib on her and after 3 uses in one day the stitching is already falling apart on it where her little hands are getting stuck in it. Very disappointing. Know I’m wondering what the rest of the outfit will be like.... cheaply made in my opinion."
2.0,Love the color and natl. Runs about 2 sizes too large. Will return
2.0,"the fabric is lookingcheap, the size of il is too small and narrow. it doesnt look like nike quality product."
2.0,"The fit was off, weird, and not comfortable."
2.0,"Ugh, the styling of these glasses look good, but the quality is bad. Don’t waste your money."
2.0,Too large (gaudy) for me - will gift it to someone who likes very large necklaces
2.0,This is a super cute dress but it was made so small that I had to return it.
2.0,too high. difficult to make smaller.
2.0,I thought it was made of cotton. Its a thin silky and shiny material.
2.0,Not a bery well thought out design. Tight under the atm pits and threads hanging everywhere. It’s rare that I put on a shirt that makes me feel so miserable that I would rather wear nothing.
2.0,"I was disappointed with this jacket. Very cheaply made, short, and the sleeves are SO short! It’s cute - but not practical."
2.0,Cute shoes but they run small
2.0,Very small and odd fabric.
2.0,"Wrong size delivered. I'm 5'7"" and 120lbs, XL definitely does not work for me. Cannot recommend."
2.0,Inaccurate sizing and cheap material
2.0,Not true to color and it’s stiff fabric
2.0,To the point of being almost see through.
2.0,did not look like the picture at all
2.0,"It was very light and the color was nice, but I just didn't like the look of it.  I don't know why..."
2.0,"The sizing was okay, however the fit was shapeless. I was also hoping the material would be a little thicker but it was a tshirt jersey weight. There was no tag and i struggled determining the front and back of the shirt. I was going to return the item since the fit was unflattering however the item is not eligible for returns."
2.0,"This is one of the dresses they warn you about when purchasing online. The pictures are misleading and the fabric is not very comfortable. Also, be 100% sure you want to buy a boat neck because this is not flattering to the average body size. I am having it tailored to have a different top due to the unflattering nature."
2.0,"I was pretty disappointed in this sweatshirt even though I buy a lot of Goodthread products.<br /><br />First, the collar is very large. When I tried it on I thought to myself: did I accidentally purchase a women's sweatshirt?<br /><br />Second, it is very narrow and has very little stretch. I wear medium in nearly every piece of clothing type I buy, and this is a very tight product on me.<br /><br />I think they missed on this on."
2.0,The material that this Sandler is made out of could smash a flying net
2.0,Way to short had to where leggings with it
2.0,"The elastic doesn't hold it up very well. When you walk, it falls down."
2.0,Not the best quality. TTS
2.0,"These socks are way to short, don’t plan to wear them with boots, they consistently slip down.  I ended up buying new socks and throwing these away after two weeks."
2.0,Not crazy abt.the fabric o fit. Runs small. Quite form fitting. Ordered a lg.to small.
2.0,"Honestly, I'm not sure how this fits, since when I opened the package I can watch TV right through the material.  For yoga pants, you'd think they would use something more opaque."
2.0,Zippers started catching and not zipping smoothly after using this for a month. Too late to return. Would not recommend unless you only will need to use it once or twice.
2.0,"Very upset that a few of my shoe charms were missing from the package when they arrived. I didn't get the Tupac charm or the Zeta charm, which was the main reason why I brought the charms. Disappointed."
2.0,"This item started out nicely. But after a few wearing they loose their comfort, just regular socks."
2.0,This belt looks nice but smells so bad I'm embarrassed to wear it.  What is that smell???
2.0,i got white and regret it. it is see through and longer than the picture. doesn’t look the same at all. comfy but would def order gray or black instead.
2.0,"I wanted to like this but the bands just don't stay in place and watch moves constantly. Tighter to prevent movement was just uncomfortable so.. while I hoped for more fashionable look, it didn't work for me."
2.0,"Its Hard to figure out the size and looks too big on a finger... a good picture of a hand wearing this will show or keep the expectation before the order... I am not that happy with it,, as it is way too big"
2.0,I thought that this was going to be a sweatshirt. The material seems to be more polyester. Disappointed
2.0,couldn't even manage to get the ball off so I could put it in. Wouldn't even work with pliers and just ended up scratching the crap out of the metal and gem. Couldn't figure out how to contact seller about this issue so I'm pretty bummed
2.0,the clasp broke a month into use
2.0,Item returned because of thinness and poor quality.. Being very sheer also not what I expected
2.0,"fairly nice leather design for the price, a little too thing for my taste. Attachment rod on the buckle side of the band would not lock into the Apple Watch as expected so I had to return it."
2.0,Too baggy..itchy
2.0,I bought this band in three colors and on all of them the band discolored and the metal peeled and discolored. I would love replacements but I have no contact info for the seller.
2.0,"Very cheaply made.  Of course, you have to consider the price.  You get what you pay for."
2.0,Chinese size XL is a US Medium.  Buy 2 sizes up
2.0,"Cute purse, waaaaaaaaaaay too small."
2.0,This product ran too small and I will most likely give it away to someone else🙄
2.0,"It came without the sahara, will return and try again. Fix it next time. 😡"
2.0,"These earring were smaller then I thought they would but then again I didn't get out the ruler when I ready the measurements.  They are very cute but not sturdy.  You get what you apy for, they were not expensive.  The biggest complaint is they shipped these earrings with the post shoved through some foam and then put them in a small manilla envelope with a label.  Well all of the posts were bent in an L shape.  They really need to ship these in a small box.  Pretty unstatisfied with this purchase."
2.0,Ok light weight
2.0,If you’ve got broader shoulders this is not for you. Doesn’t hang at all like the photo and is very tight at the neck.
2.0,So pretty..disappointed it doesn't fit
2.0,"Terrible support, will be returning"
2.0,"Shirt is very cheap, not of a very good quality and is badly designed. At one point I had to just &#34;un-tuck-it&#34; as it was impossible to play golf with the shirt tucked in."
2.0,"The color is the same, but  is not something you can use to go out,  that is my pijamas cabinet!"
2.0,"They are nice and shiny but smaller than I expected: 3.1mm instead of 3.2 as they say.<br />In addition, the screw back is thin and even screwed always spin. That means that I'll have to watch it out everyday so I don't lose the screw back or the whole earing.<br />All in all I think they could be better made."
2.0,"About halfway through my day, these have already snapped off 6 times. Their claim of ensuring a no-fail grip is simply not true, I get a better grip with my cheap set of shirt stays. 2 stars because the are far more comfortable than any other shirt stay I've worn, but doesn't make up for the amount of times I've needed to run to the bathroom to fix them."
2.0,"Extremely gaudy and I gave it my 3 year old great niece for dress up.  Sorry I wasted the small sum.  Goes to show, you get what you pay for."
2.0,"It’s quite thin, it’s a starch to call it a sweater given that it’s lighter than a long sleeved shirt. It runs a touch in the small side for an oversized I’m a l-xl in the chest usually. For reference I’m a 34DDD so an xxl should hang off my shoulder easily. However it’s  taunt around my chest and coming close to my being  formed to my stomach."
2.0,"The top runs small, so if you have big bust, you may want to go up 2 sizes"
2.0,Not what I expected..I expected it to fit better
2.0,Not what I thought they would look like
2.0,"I really liked the look of it. However, within a day of using it, the color started rubbing off and turned the edges of my sleeves dirty with black soot.  Also after a few days of wearing it, my wrist gets chafed.  I think the edges on the inside are too sharp and need to be rounded off more.  Overall it looks nice and should only be worn on occasion. It should not be the daily strap you wear your Fitbit with.<br /><br />The seller kindly offered to send me another one but I declined."
2.0,It had a weird plastic smell to it. You get what you pay for basically.
2.0,I like the quality of the product but it took forever for delivery
2.0,"well they was delayed (due to amazon) So when they got here I went to put them on and they won't close, took them back off and they still won't close so now I can't use them, after waiting all that time and they can't even be used. wow"
2.0,Waist was not what I expect it to be.
2.0,Wasn't the best quality. Most of the stars fell off. You get what you pay for I guess.
2.0,Love the art. Discolored .
2.0,Son doesn't wear it much.
2.0,"I felt like I looked like a rough housewife from the 70's.  Cheap feeling material, ugly cut dress, and would not recommend."
2.0,"It didn’t look anything like the picture you could see every seam that connected the ruffles. Looked very cheap. Maybe I got a defective one, but either way wasn’t happy and sent it back."
2.0,They’ve tarnished a month after receipt. Disappointing since they’re supposed to be gold plated. Other gold plated jewelry I’ve received hasn’t done this.
2.0,Way too see through!!!
2.0,I love the look - doesn’t last long though
2.0,"The shirt was very  ""boxy"" it had no shape and makes you look like a tent.... not very happy with this purchase"
2.0,"This looks a lot cheaper in person than it does online.  It fits ok, but I don't like the quality so I'm returning it."
2.0,"My 10 yr old son says these boots were adequately comfy and his feet were never cold when dry (in 30 - 40 degrees) but, the upper cuff is very wide and loose - you can't get it tight, so snow was constantly getting in through the top and the insides would be completely wet.  Most kids boots you can tighten the top, not these.  Also when I put my hands inside, I can feel that some parts of the inside lining were already torn, after 2 days!  The one saving grace is that the inside of the boot would dry quickly if left over a heater vent overnight. But STILL.<br /><br />Also, when I put some water on the blue upper fabric part, the water soaked right in. So aside from the black rubber lower part of the shoe, it is not waterproof at all.  Really not adequate for kids to play in the snow.  I bought these because they were a low price and were not delayed (needed them fast).  Next time I know better than to go cheap like this."
2.0,"I'm sad to report this shirt was lacking in a few ways. One, it is entirely too long, about 8 inches too long; quite frankly it's so long it's ridiculous. Second, you cannot get the wrinkles out of it...ever...not even with a hot iron, or a steam iron. I didn't try starching it because really, no one should have to starch their t-shirts. The style and design are good and he looks great in it, if it weren't too long and wrinkled."
2.0,OSFA is not accurate. There is an adjustable strap in the back but the hat bunches up so much that it looks bad.
2.0,"The jacket seems like it could have some longevity however the waterproofing was applied very poorly to the material. We have used the jacket one day for a few hours of snow play. The jacket very quickly gets soaked in places, making the jacket feel cold and heavy. I later tested this lack of waterproofing out at home and verified the problem. Not sure what the seller can do for me but not happy as this won't withstand a full day of playing in the snow."
2.0,I've bought this band twice because it's cute and I thought maybe the first time was just bad luck...unfortunately it's a waste of money...the pins keep falling out and almost lost my watch
2.0,When opening the package I could tell the bathing suit was already worn because there was condensation inside the plastic bag it was in and smelled musty. I washed the bathing suit and tried it on.. The bottom fit perfectly but the top is very awkward. I got a small and it still buckled out in the middle. Would not recommend
2.0,Runs extremely Small
2.0,I only received 2 pieces. Very disappointed about that
2.0,It's very pretty but also very thin. My son pulled on it by accident and it broke. Only had it for less than a week.
2.0,Visable from the side.
2.0,The strap itself a a navy blue and not black as advertised
2.0,The edges of the band are coming apart. Little metal pieces are sticking out and snags/scratches everything.
2.0,Pants were completely see-through. Unacceptable for a child
2.0,I feel as if the underwear is design backwards
2.0,Only wore these about six times when one of the straps broke. Usually the BOC brand are made better.
2.0,"This sweater has thick high quality fabric, but it is a little itchy. Also, it’s a strange length: not quite a crop, and not hip length. It also bunches up when you move. I had to return it."
2.0,"Love that it puts my shoulders back but it isn't worth it because it gets bigger as you wear it, rides up to your belly button (constantly pulling it down) and is starting to fray after my 3rd wash:("
2.0,Stand as a child
2.0,"Aesthetically pleasing, but not adjustable. Unless we tried it incorrectly..."
2.0,"I was very pleased with the quality of this dress.  However, the sizing was very misleading.  I typically wear a size 4, but I could barely get the size 8 zipped.  When trying to return the dress, the postage was more than the item.  I requested the seller to send me a prepaid label.  They didn't want to do that and stopped communicating with me."
2.0,This is not a cardigan it's super thin!
2.0,it was too big. I will order it again but in a smaller size. Love the color.
2.0,Came with a few kinks in it that wouldn't come out. Nice to look at but it was annoying to put on and off
2.0,I wasn't expecting them to fall put of.my ears and some of them came broke for 30 dollars I figured they'd be pretty good thin peice of plastic on the top but that's it. Definitely isnt a 1/2in
2.0,I thought this price was too good to be true. When the hats arrived I was highly disappointed that they felt like dollar store quality hats.
2.0,Ordered a 3xl i wear a 2xl it wont even go half way around me even with ribbons loosened very unhappy
2.0,The material is cheap and fades within days. I wore the pink one for about five days and it started discoloring and turning grayish 😕
2.0,The neckline felt too hight
2.0,These broke easily. My daughter is gentle on things and it is broken and there is no screw to put it back on. Then plastic.
2.0,"The necklace is very cheaply made and can not be worn.  It is a nice keepsake but not worth the money.  It broke the second time I tried to wear it.  I will have to repair and replace the chain and clasp, if I would ever want to wear it."
2.0,Didn't look anything like the picture. Fit very small and very tight. I'm a small frame but this shirt would have been tight on an 85lb woman.
2.0,It’s too small. I ordered the size I normally order. But I didn’t know it was coming from a foreign country. I would have ordered one size up. Very disappointed
2.0,They are not for you if you want to cover your ears or if you have a big head. They will not keep you warm.<br /><br />It's not the hassle of returning so I'm giving them to my niece or donating.
2.0,"The swim suit itself was pretty nice, except the fit was pretty weird. I am 5’10 around 130 lbs and 32D and got a medium. The bottoms were really baggy in the front and the top has tiny cups but is loose around the sides."
2.0,Too bulky and stiff and it kept a funny smell. It is pretty and I get compliments on the look of it.
2.0,I thought this zip u hoodie would be more heavy weight for cooler days. It is a fleece and heavy weight but the wind and cold air go right through the sweatshirt. It does not keep me warm.
2.0,It is a pretty looking dress. Bought it thinking that it is 100% cotton. However the cotton is not soft but rough to touch and itchy to wear. This does not improve with use. I wear it because I like the design and style but can keep it on for not more than a couple of hours.
2.0,Daughters didn’t care much for the material!
2.0,Cheap. Thin. Bends.
2.0,"Not flattering at all. I had room for an adult diaper in it (if I wanted one), and the legs were tight. All in all, it was a good idea but poor execution."
2.0,Doesn't look or feel like jadeite. Very light in weight and density--  looks like dyed glass or polymer injected product.
2.0,"This dress is too big and just drapes.I got a large. I am aprox 210 5'3"". It also is not exactly as pictured - the back gives me maternity-ish vibes. However I am not returning because it it was only 10$'s. I can wear around the house if I want for comfort. Plus! It has pockets which I love."
2.0,"Washed twice one of them has thread coming out, looks like a wrinkle."
2.0,Ordered two of these and had to return them both. First the positive. The shirts are true the the measurements given. The quality seems very good and the fabric feels good to the touch and is nice and thick for winter. Sadly I had a couple issues that just broke this purchase for me. The waist is set low but would have made it work. The main problem is with the sleeves which were too tight. While the rest of the shirt is true to size so to speak the sleeves are too small. This seems to be a very bad trend in the women's clothing industry. Bad enough it didn't fit my body type due to  the waist being set too low but then the sleeves were two sizes too small. I don't think many women have limbs disproportionate to their trunks. If a woman is big in the middle the rest of her body is going to match.
2.0,"When I saw the picture it looked like a sweater, but it was not . so I was dissappointed"
2.0,Everything fit well but tv's waist. Apparently they think plus size people have small waists. Color and quality were great.
2.0,"Battery stopped working the second time I wore it :( I like the design, but it was a waste of money, even at this low price."
2.0,"The writing was illegible on most rings, and the edges were cut so sharply that it hurt to wear them"
2.0,"A few things I dislike about this dress.<br />*Keep in mind I'm a 5 foot tall 140lb size 10 28-year-old.<br />1) The camisole that is attached and goes under the sheer lace dress is too low in the breasts. It hardly covers the nipples! Way too low. I plan to detach it from the garment and sew the straps shorter to hold &#34;the girls&#34; in. I have DD girls so they're not particularly &#34;high&#34; breasts.<br />2) The dress fits very small, which I knew in reading other comments. I truly recommend going 2-4 sized up. In the photo of the model, it fits loosely as a shift dress and hangs in the back. As a true size 10 I'd need a 14 to accomplish a similar look.<br />3) It is far from white! It's a vintage cream (in my opinion). See photos for comparison on my true white bedsheets<br />It's very cute. The price is low and I like the look so I won't be returning it. It had a funky smell upon arrival that washed right out."
2.0,"I have very sun sensitive eyes so I ordered these sunglasses to help me when I'm driving or cycling to keep me from squinting...  They are indeed DARK, but you can't see enough with them on to even walk around much less drive or ride a bicycle.  The only purpose might be sitting in a chair or lying down when the light is causing you to have a migraine."
2.0,Liked the material but size was too large.
2.0,But still fits.
2.0,The orthpedic support is not as the picture showing.
2.0,"I ordered the blue, black and neon yellow/green.  I received the pink instead.  I already ordered the pink one to see if it was going to fit before I ordered the pack.  So now I have to pink sports bras instead of four different colors."
2.0,"Pretty cheap, the fabric is quiet sheer so I couldn’t even wear it. Returned ."
2.0,They worked perfect for ten days and then the waist band broke. Not good quality. Buy a different kind.
2.0,I ordered the yellow light gray and the solid blue in medium which fits greats. Holds up well in washer and dryer. However when I ordered the plaid- light gray in small and medium they were extremely long to mid thigh and sleeves were too short.
2.0,Came in a nice box.  And they're cute for the price.  The stick is very thin. Going to be surprised if it lasts more than a week
2.0,This dress is very nice from the front. From the back the gathered material at my lower back/bum was just too loose so it didnt create a sexy look. I dont think it's a size issue because I got a small and everything else about the dress fits great. Even though it's only $11 I dont think it was worth it because it's just not sexy.
2.0,The necklace break easily
2.0,Bad quality and a lot shorter than I like my tank tops. Don't waste your money.
2.0,Material would wrinkle too easily
2.0,"Too pokey, not a smooth lift, it's a pokey look with mo lift, even with a tight fitting sports bra. Definitely not for bigger breasts."
2.0,"So yes, it's comfortable and lightweight because it's the thinnest material possible. It's not to be used as a mask but the other uses are fine. We use them for yardwork but definitely not as a way to protect ourselves from anything"
2.0,"Nope, just didn't work for me.  I'm 130 lbs, and 5'6 and I think I ordered the small.  I'm super fit and on the thin side, with a lot of muscle tone, but the bottoms, uggh, just no.  I don't mind the minimal coverage as I was looking for something like it for an adult trip to the lake, but just didn't look good on my bootie.  The top wasn't bad, but it was a really weird wrap fit that was difficult to figure out and didn't stay put under my boobs.  I returned it."
2.0,The Micro-Fiber Fabric is awful...  A soft cotton Terry would surely be better.
2.0,I’m giving these 2 stars because they are super cute but my daughter can never wear them because they CUT the sides of her feet and then turn into blisters/scabs. It’s horrible. Took weeks for her feet to heel after the very first time she wore them and then I was dumb enough to try them a second time on her several weeks later and I made my poor girl suffer again. By then these were too late to return. So these are horrible to wear but cute to look at.
2.0,"So it would’ve been an amazing dress, but the attention to detail definitely lacked. the middle band was soooooooooooo slanted, the shoulder pads would not smooth out from their lumpy mess."
2.0,"I loved the dress, but when I put it on, there was a big hole in it. I was very disappointed."
2.0,"Tiny!  I'm normally a 38 C and because I knew it was coming from China I purchased the 40"". Forget it - wouldn't have fit me when I was a 36. Buy the 42""<br /><br />It's pretty but I have zero idea of how it holds up because it doesn't fit"
2.0,Very light and cheap looking . This should’ve been no more that 2bucks
2.0,does not keep feet warm as expected  Wool much better
2.0,The paper it shipped with was written in an Asian type langage so I cannot tell if its truly mulberry silk or not. It feels ok. But I don't see myself wearing it unless I have to. Wouldn't want to use it as an everyday bra. The cups seem to be too close together or something.
2.0,Looked cool. The mirrors actually worked. Broke after 2 days
2.0,My girl loves these boots and she has wore them a lot since I gave to her in late October.  Today... Dec 9... She came home from school and the zipper part that goes up and down fell apart.  The metal actually fell apart can't even put a new pull on it.
2.0,"Bought for the misses. She loved it. Then the key broke off when she set her hand down on a table.<br />Life happens, but I wouldn't buy another one."
2.0,Poorly made. Pretty junky. Stay away.
2.0,"I purchased these from ebay (cheaper than amazon) in a size 16. I am 5'6 and 250lbs, size 16/18 pants. Based off other reviews I ordered the 16 and expected them to fit. The top portion did fit fine but the thigh and calf area was too tight, I could walk in them just find but bending my knees or lifting my legs were too tight. I couldn't imagine trying to put boots on over these. They were returned."
2.0,To thin....not what expecyed
2.0,Many of these fail while using.
2.0,wasn't that good at all
2.0,The product looked bigger in the picture when ordered but when received it was way too small. I needed an extremely larger magnifier.
2.0,"I ordered Small and received Large, and it's not worth sending it back all the way to China. Dropped it off at the local tailor; we'll see how it turns out."
2.0,zero air flow but looks cool
2.0,Cute shoes!!! Bite sizing is WAY off!!!<br />I ordered the 13 for my size 11 four year old because reviews said size up. When held up sole to sole this shoe is so much smaller I would say it is probably a US 8or9.<br />Super bummed!
2.0,"Super cute swim suit, but folks were not joking about the bottoms running super duper small. I wear a small but ordered a medium thinking I should be fine, well, the top fit good and the bottoms were like XXS! I totally had a &#34;plumber's crack&#34;!! I'm sending the suit back 🤔"
2.0,Very thin material. Baggy in some areas.
2.0,"MUCH thinner than expected, based upon product image. Definitely does NOT have a silk feel. What it has is a scratchy polyester feel and an industrial smell.  Fabric is so thin, you can barely make out colors and a pattern. Give these a miss and pop for that genuine, quality silk. Save yourself the disappointment."
2.0,"First I purchased the blue short sleeved version of this dress and it was beautiful had a attached belt  and decent quality for the price. I loved it so much I decided why not get another just in a different color. I went with the bright pinks multicolor one with the roll up sleeves…. Sooooo bad!!!!  The material is so thin and cheaply made!  The belt<br />isnt even attached,the buttons only come up to the top of your waist area with the top wide open,itchy feeling and It’s DEFINITELY not polyester or anything like the other dress which looks satin material.Save yourself the return and stick with the solid colors!"
2.0,The dress is really wrinkled so I end up steaming it. Took a lot of time to get it looking nice. I don’t have a photo yet to upload  my girl will be wearing it tomorrow and I’m writing this review after I spend so much time ironing.
2.0,I usually wear a medium but ordered a Large to be safe. They run very small. Size Large is like a small in reality.
2.0,They are cute but 2 of the clasps broke when I first tried to put it on. I'm trying to get a hold of the seller to get these 2 replaced but I haven't had any luck.
2.0,Socks fit too tight. Barely got them on his feet let alone his legs. He has slight edema not really big legs.
2.0,I love the blue color. The small (what I usually wear) fit good through the body but the arms are WAY too short.
2.0,Smaller in size.
2.0,"Got a Xlarge, small"
2.0,I have small hands and bought these in size L/xlarge after reading the reviews. The glove is big but the inner lining is small. All of my fingers fit except my pinky finger since the inner lining of the glove runs 3 inches shorter than the outside. No worth the expense returning. Will not buy again.
2.0,This hat makes me insecure over my headsize.
2.0,Still smells funny.
2.0,Fit well and nice fabric. I don't like them because then sit at the hip. I like my to sit at the waist.
2.0,I only gave them two stars because I am a size 8-10 usually M/L and XL didn't come close to fitting me. Then when I went to return them they charged me the postage to get the mismarketed overalls back to them.
2.0,These were really well presented and very nice and comfortable.  However one of the magnets popped out after 1 week of use which made them in usable.
2.0,the wing broke in half
2.0,"I purchased these because the item pictures had a lot of colorful, cute squishy toys. They also had a variety of donuts which my daughter loved. I understand the description says random, but I feel we didn’t get a “fun” random package of squishy toys 😔"
2.0,Bracelet too large and hard to adjust if someone does not have a large wrist.
2.0,kinked
2.0,I love Amazon workout sets but this was so unflattering I wore it once and then donated it. It was loose in the wrong areas. Not flattering at all. And kept falling when I worked out.
2.0,"These boots are cute for the price but poorly made, bulky on the outside and tight inside (oddly shaped on the inside), makes for an uncomfortable fit."
2.0,I like the look and feel but the band does come loose at times.
2.0,POOR Quality.  They are tightly woven so they do not stretch out at all!  Thus the reason why they start unraveling so quickly.  On one of the pairs I got a few days use out of them and the second set literally started snapping apart as I was trying to pull them up my leg a bit more.  If you are over 5’8” don’t expect these to go too far up your legs.
2.0,I bought A-Black. The shorts run a bit too large. They did not come with a belt as pictured. I think they would stay up a lot better if they did. Do not advertise with a belt if it doesn't come with one. I might return these.<br />Other than that they seem quite high quality.
2.0,"Ordered a size up (M) and it still didn't fit. Couldn't even get it over my hips or my shoulders to get it on. I'm 5'2, 125lbs with an athletic build."
2.0,Had to return because this bracelet was way too small for me. (I'm the wife btw) my wrists are a size 7 . Too small .this would.fit a child.<br />.
2.0,I like the socks a lot. They fit well and did not shrink when washed. However they only sent me 11 socks out of 12.  I emailed them a day ago and hope they respond soon.
2.0,Cheaply made. These make an expensive shirt look cheap..
2.0,Returned this item. Found sizes ran extremely large and quality did not meet my expectations.
2.0,This arrived today and I'm really disappointed.  The color is MUCH darker than the picture - not a sky blue at all.  It's skimpy and isn't nearly as nice as it looks in the picture.  The sleeves are shorter than in the picture as well.  I'm probably going to return it.
2.0,The gold part of these earrings is a lot cheaper looking than expected.
2.0,"I really want to like this dress. My dress did not have a hole to run the third inside strap through, I had to make one myself. Then you're left with three straps to tie around the waist section which seems odd (although maybe I just don't know how to wrap it). Also the way the dress wraps, I will have to wear on a camisole underneath. It would probably work for somewhat who is smaller in the boob area, but if you have a larger top it won't fit right. The length was perfect and I like the overall shape of the dress. For sizing references I am a US size 6, 5'7&#34;, and a C cup."
2.0,"The socks themselves are fine, but the materials are NOT as described. The description says (in two places) that the socks are made of ""14.5% Acrylic, 73.8% Polyester fiber, 5.6% Regenerated fiber, 4.9% other fiber, and 1.2% Spandex."" The labels on the product itself says ""35% wool, 29% cotton, 36% polyester.""<br /><br />I specifically bought these socks thinking they didn't have wool, as I had planned to give them to someone who has a wool allergy. So kind of a waste for my purposes. The socks are fine if you're looking for wool/cotton/polyester socks."
2.0,A lot smaller than the ones I bought in a store. She loved everything about this set and would not give it back. But the clear plastic you slide your foot into was so small.
2.0,Definitely not the softest.
2.0,"The sweater itself is nicely made, but it is true that the sizes are way off.  I am usually an extra small, and I made an effort to size up as suggested.  The sweater I have is labeled as a medium, and it fits like a very fitted extra small.  I have skinny arms and it's form fitting.  Needed it so used it but it would have been better if I ordered a large.  Haven't washed  it yet, so it may be passed down to a niece (age 10) if it shrinks as it may."
2.0,Broke after 2 wears. Dainty and fragile.
2.0,The color was not what I thought it would be. I thought in the photo it looked navy and in person it brownish and I don't like it.
2.0,I order this dress the last week in March....wash and worn maybe 5 times and already coming apart at the seam.
2.0,Sea Creatures don't stand out.  They blend in too much with the background so you can't tell what it is.  Quality is good however.
2.0,Color not as pictured. Sent back
2.0,If you want to keep your dog or cat warm in the winter then these are perfect. I bought them because the picture indicated that they would cover a calf muscle. They barely cover half of the calf on a seven year old girl and they do not stretch.
2.0,didnt like the style. very thin
2.0,I was really hoping this would work because I thought it was really cute. However the fit is bad. Its shapeless and does nothing for you. Fits big. I'm returning.
2.0,"It came packed nicely. And it was fast delivery. But it says it can use for a lip piercing 🤔 . This thing isn't strong enough to hold the jewelry anywhere. The lip, the nose, the ear. Also the jewelry is more the size of an earring stud than a facial stud."
2.0,If you are tall or have long arms prepare for short sleeves.
2.0,These may fit a western child or very skinny teenager but not a grown mam/ chef. What a joke! Who measures these things ?
2.0,"For the price, I dont feel they are steady and a little cheap looking..."
2.0,I did not like it! It caught on everything turned colors really quick and broke in less than three weeks
2.0,"I ordered the grey and coffee color.  They are very cute but fit small and a little tight.  I am 5'5&#34; and 145lbs.  They are great for wearing under clothes for extra warmth.  I wore the top under a big bulky sweater and it was great. Now, the smell is horrible but getting better with each wash. BTW. The coffe color one fit better than the grey one. It was longer in the torso and arms."
2.0,Outside zipper broke after 2 months of daily use.
2.0,The earring broke as I was putting it on my daughter.
2.0,Odered size according to chart. Received and could not get on my hand at all. Exchanged for larger size. Still tight. Wore them a few times out in the barn to do chores and no stretching. Fingers were throbbing they were so cold. I have Reynaud's and my hand were so painfully cold had to go in and warm up. Still trying to find different work gloves similar and having a hard time. Need to make more womens chore gloves. Liked the rubber coating and liked the fact they are lined. Was dissappointed.
2.0,Too small as it was a child’s size.  Returned for credit very easy.
2.0,"Does not fit watches as advertised it ""Fits"" the 46 Classic 4 but does not fit securely."
2.0,"I own several UnTUCKit shirts and I must say I am a little disappointed with this slim-fit Garzon shirt.  Mainly, the color on the Amazon image appears lighter than the shirt I received.  Plus the length is too long, it fits no differently than off-the-shelf shirts at department stores.  I wanted the shirt to go with a navy blue sports jacket I purchased for a fast-approach event.  I ordered the shirt two days before the event.  Delivery was speedy, it arrived in one day.  But unfortunately, the shirt doesn't work for me.  I will probably return it."
2.0,One broke because of constant use
2.0,Not same color as pictures. Very see through. The style fit oddly. Would not buy again.
2.0,"I'm 5'10"" and even the medium was ridiculously long."
2.0,Med. was way oversize and pocket on arm sleeve very uncomfortable
2.0,"The shade of this dress is not what we expected. (It's more of a red than burgundy color)<br />It's cute and fits nice, but the color is a little off."
2.0,Bad shape
2.0,"At first when I put this on my head I didn’t like the way it fit. There is a lot of room and was not snug against my head like it looks in the picture. I then got my hair braided and was able to use it that way (I did look like I had a beehive, but it’s for sleep so it didn’t bother me) I really liked it when I have to sleep with rollers at night...it’s the perfect size...now it’s ripped...I’ve only had it for a month...right when it’s too late to return it...how convenient. Hopefully the second one will last longer..."
2.0,These are amazing but they are soooo heavy I just can’t wear them
2.0,"I loved the design of this bag, and in theory it would have been great for an overnight flight with an early-morning arrival. You put your change of clothes and toiletries in the bottom, and avoid cluttering up the main compartment with stuff you don't need for the flight itself. It slides over your suitcase handle, and has a nice outside pocket for tickets and such. And the long shoulder strap could go across your body, to make hauling it through the airport much easier, right? The design was exactly what I was looking for.<br /><br />In reality, the long strap was too thin, and dug into my shoulder badly. So I ordered a shoulder pad that velcroed onto it, and figured I would be set for the trip. But the hardware on the shoulder strap snapped like a twig before I even got to the gate. Granted, I had it stuffed pretty full, but isn't that the point of a large bag like this?<br /><br />The material of the bag itself was fairly plastic-y and stiff, but seemed sturdy enough, and the bottom corners were reinforced. It wasn't a terribly expensive bag, so I could have lived with that. But the hardware was beyond flimsy, and too small to take the weight of even an overnight-flight's worth of clothes and neck pillows. I continued to use it on my trip without the shoulder strap, but when it was expanded, it was too tall to carry by the handles without being kicked or dragging the ground; and they weren't quite long enough to make carrying it over my shoulder comfortable when it was full.<br /><br />Overall, a nice design, but the hardware needs to be sturdier."
2.0,It was a bit too loose and way too short. Returned item.
2.0,"I ordered this and thought it was an adult, one-size-fits all. It was way too small for me (and I think I have an average size neck), so I ended up giving it to an 8 year old girl at the barn and it fit her great."
2.0,"First and foremost, I will say I'm pretty positive the pieces I received were not white gold plated as advertised. They are shiny, but I have serious doubts it's white gold. Secondly, the chains provided as stated by previous reviewers are pretty thin and flimsy. Thirdly, the angel wing arrived in ok condition, but my dragon wing came kinda beat up with holes and dents all over the place. They're cute, but not worth the price."
2.0,Son muy grandes y se ve feos puestos.
2.0,The shoulder bag is not the same color or print of my boots.<br />Sorry and thank you
2.0,It’s heavy and feels solid. I order the black one and you can tell it’s for sure just a coating that isn’t very well done. It’s for sure going to peel or scratch off. I wish they had explained the coating better. I wish I had bought the stainless steel one.
2.0,"Cheap quality, cheap made, cheap material."
2.0,Blue color looks pretty on line but really harsh in real life.
2.0,"I really love the look of this dress, I ordered the XXL, but it fit like a medium. I normally wear a L or XL in shirts, but the top of this dress was so tight, it smashed my breasts almost flat, I'm a 38 DDD.  The dress fit everywhere else. But if you are a larger breasted lady, I wouldn't recommend purchasing this dress. Hope this helps!"
2.0,It arrived folded over and it didn't look right.
2.0,These shoes were completely destroyed after 3 months of occasional use.
2.0,"I am a 38c, not the biggest of breast size but still makes a difference. Flatters and fits breast area but does not flatter the rest. I order L in the grey/black/ sage color too tight. The red and black are too big."
2.0,"Knowing how clothing items run in the amazon environment, i ordered the largest size available on this. While it fits, it doesn’t fit like a sweater should, more baggy, more comfy. This one just sits. Runs extremely small, I’m an XL-XXL on tops and I ordered a 4X and i can say it fits like an xl would. As for the quality of the sweater, not the best. The seams are terrible and it has loose threads everywhere. If i attempt to pull any, I’m afraid it might fall apart. The colors are pretty but not enough to make this worth a buy. I was hoping it would be a lighter sweater also but it’s thicker than expected. Will try to return if it’s not a huge hassle."
2.0,When washing the shirt it shrink and was not what I expected it to do.
2.0,"The sizing for this particular outfit is way off. The size 2-3t is equivalent to a youth girls size 7/8, it even measured a little larger when compared to my older daughters sz 7/8 shorts n shirts."
2.0,So not good...the grey block is actually tan and the seams that connect the color blocks have already started to come appart..after 1 wear. It's a real bummer because I do like the solid one I bought at the same time.
2.0,Late delivery and to small for grow up people
2.0,Color more peach than pink.
2.0,I was disappointed with this one. It did NOT lay how it was advertised and it was a bit small.
2.0,"The quality is not very good, it breaks without washing a few times"
2.0,Boots are super cute but my toddler was able to take the bows off pretty much right away so those are pointless. Either actually put them on your product the right way so they are secure or don't put them on at all.
2.0,"The gold appliqué peeled at the corners after first wash. The bottoms were very high wasted. Otherwise, comfortable. I returned mine, however, because I was able to find better pj’s for the same price."
2.0,Not a good clasp system. Item consistently unbuckles. No doubt I will lose it. I would not purchase again.
2.0,"The jacket I received was not the red jacket I ordered. It was a 'hot pink' jacket. The material and construction is  cheap. When zipped, it doesn't look bad, but when open, the pockets flap around kinda foolishly. My plan was to just wear it zipped, but the zipper doesn't appear to have a whole lot of integrity. Also, though I ordered an XL, hoping to have a some extra room, the jacket I received is a actually little snug - so wearing it zipped is out.<br />On the good side, the dashiki print is bright and beautiful and I do get a lot of compliments when I  wear it."
2.0,"Larger then I thought it would be. I ordered medium cause, that is my normal size.  Should of ordered smaller!"
2.0,I wore this ring about 6 times. I went to take the ring off and the stone was gone. I hope this is not normal.
2.0,"I do think it's beautiful and made of very good quality but it still completely defeats the purpose of what it's used for. It's specifically supposed to have 108 beads exact, but sadly mine has 111. The mantras I read are supposed to be recited 108 times which has numerical meaning. They should have counted and recounted before packing and shipping this out. Scared to reorder again to see if I got a defected one."
2.0,This dress fits super small and tight. Even tho I love a good tight dress this was uncomfortable.
2.0,These are cute and soft but shrunk bad in wash (cold water tumble dry low) and don’t hold shape. Fine for wiping face/mouth but small for a burp cloth. We much prefer our Green Sprouts burp cloths.
2.0,Loved this idea and would have been glad to wear these but only wore one time due to the underwear part riding up.  Need longer legs.
2.0,"Based on the reviews and the size chart given, I bought this size. It was 2 sizes too big AT LEAST. Good quality, but the sizing was appalling. I bought the yellow and “blue”, I put blue in quotes because it was definitely gray not blue at all. This item is the most inconsistent to the information given that unfortunately I have to rate this so low. Besides size and color the shirt was actually really good quality for such a reasonable price."
2.0,This is very large.
2.0,Very poor quality. The logo is ironed on and lacks the definition of the image.
2.0,"I really wanted to like this because the red color and fit was great, but the cheap material ruins it. Once ironed, it looks fabulous, but it wrinkles way too quickly, even from just sitting a few minutes which makes it very visible how cheap the fabric is. Also there's some extra fabric/flap under the cowl that's larger than the neck area that isn't sewn down, so it sticks out as you move and looks like the dress straps were sewn crooked or just wasn't finished."
2.0,"If you have a booty, this will not cover it. The top was okay. The padding was weird but should have expected much due to price. The color was cute though :/"
2.0,"The studs themselves are pretty, but aren't long enough to fit a lip piercing. They are so tight it digs into my lip and starts cutting it."
2.0,Pretty shirt a little too long tho
2.0,They did not last very long before the soul started coming apart my son only had them for 2 mos. And they just weren't worth the money
2.0,these are cute but SO SO SO heavy. I wore them to a dinner date and took them off halfway through the entree.
2.0,This watch was too small!  How can a watch be too small?  It didn't even come close to fitting my husband's wrist - and he has normal size wrists - nothing out of the ordinary.  Now I'm afraid to order something else - I've never ordered a watch that was too small?!
2.0,"It was delivered quickly but since they were out of the black that I ordered, they sent me blue. I was not a fan of this but for the price it wasn't worth me returning or calling and complaining. They did send a nice apology letter. The quality was good and they fit in easily. They would have had a 4 star but since they weren't the color I ordered I gave a 2 star."
2.0,"The fabric feels great, its soft to the touch and feels cool. The shirt itself fit snug and the neck hole is way too large for my liking, it was almost like a tank top. I sent mine back and won't buy again."
2.0,"The sizing of the skirt was off, rendering it unwearable by anyone in my home. The top fit a DD just fine."
2.0,"Design too small, cheaply made and does sit right on your head.."
2.0,Jewels had already fallen of when i received it.
2.0,"The shoes are cute. BUT they are not true to size. I wear a size 8. I ordered an 8, and as you can see in the pics the shoes are quirky. The sole is a size 8 but the placement of the fabric makes you unable to slide foot to front. ALSO they are slim. My pinky toes hung off the side of the shoe. AND the fabric in wide at the top, so your foot won't be securely in the shoe. So they were returned.. but cute to look at."
2.0,The gauge size was one size bigger than I ordered. The latch is not the best.
2.0,The fabric was not up to par.
2.0,"While I realize cheap pieces like this don’t last forever, the center “stone” fell out before I even wore it once. I buy a lot of inexpensive, fun pieces that I expected to be able to wear this 10 to 15 times at least before they fell apart. This had to be repaired before I could wear it once. Don’t recommend buying it."
2.0,"ive always been skeptical about ordering tops online... and i was right to feel that way. The blouse is quite big, seems as if they just found pieces of cloth and made a 6yo stitch it together. this immediately became a shirt for when im cleaning the house. its that thin...i wont feel too hot in it while sweating."
2.0,"These Invicta timepieces are either cheap and low class watches made with either an inaccurate Japanese Miyota movement from Citizen or an over priced Swiss ETA that can be found for less in a Victoronix Swiss Army Watch.<br /><br />Whenever I see these Invicta's on Amazon or ShopNBC, it amazes me how they pitch their oversized pieces as stylish when the reality is they have to make oversized pieces because they lack the refinement of miniaturized Swiss movements.<br /><br />The reason Rolex, Omega, Tissot and other Swiss watches can be significantly smaller or just as large is they have centuries of heritage and experience in working with tiny gears and parts.<br /><br />Invicta and other lesser quality entrants have to buy less expensive and larger components but are loathe to admit as much and it is evident within the first year of ownership as the watch conspicuously fails to accurately keep time.<br /><br />Better off buying a Casio or Citizen since their Miyota movements are consistently accurate and don't pretend to be elegant nor overcharge their customers like Invicta does."
2.0,Pretty basic. Not comfortable. Just not what was expected. I would not buy again.
2.0,"Do not get. It is most definitely a bootleg product. On one of the buttons, the Pokemon battle theme started playing. Its only 18 dollars and it arrived on time, so at the very least it has that."
2.0,Too tight around the arm areas and looked fairly boxy.
2.0,The photo of the dress in the picture looks MUCH nicer than what it looks like in person.  It actually fits quite frumpy looking.  I returned the dress.
2.0,"Illegal in most states, if not all, whether smoked or clear. Didn't even know this was an issue until the notice on the back of the cover announced that I should check in my state. If you search the FAQ, people have asked whether it is legal, and the answer that is copied and pasted is &#34;As long as it is not covering all characters on the license it is legal.&#34; Well, it is a plate shield, so it will be doing that. If you google it, the law is clear even if it is misguided."
2.0,Watch started to slow down about two weeks into wearing it. A new battery did not help. Very disappointed because it’s a pretty watch. 2 stars for style.
2.0,If you want to hold a lot of keys not for you. If you want to hold like 5 it’s great.
2.0,The string popped on the wings. There wasn't enough room to put my arms through. I couldn't get a refund because it was past the deadline or else I would have submitted one.
2.0,"I was disappointed with this purchase; I expected better from Samsonite. To begin with, the packaging was poor; it came in a flimsy beat-up box. While the bag looks good on the photos, upon unboxing it one might get the impression that it is a cheap imitation —it does not feel like Samsonite luggage. The construction is poor. I had to cut a couple of loose threads on the handle's stitching. The fabric sags on the sides. Moreover, the top of the bag sags causing the USB-A and Micro-USB ports to be lower than zipper in front. The result is that access to the USB ports is encumbered by the zipper. Based on the presumption that this is not what Samsonite intended, this might be a manufacturing defect rather than poor design. Also, the plastic dome that houses the USB ports came scratched. Finally, please be aware that Samsonite has a similar, and possibly newer, model that has a single USB-A port on the side. As of the time of this review, eBags has a promotional price that is lower than Amazon’s. Perhaps, this bag would be an OK purchase at that price. It is likely that I will return this item."
2.0,"Awesome looking bathing suit, but the top was weirdly tight on my boobs. I'm a 34D and it like pressed in on them and my under boob wasn't all in the cup, like it also went into the middle part of the top where the zipper is. Unfortunate, because it is cute!!"
2.0,"This is VERY thin material.  The front is lined with a thin liner but you can see through the whole thing anyway. It doesn't lay well, and wrinkles easily. The material feels cheap."
2.0,Really disappointed in this garment. Washing instructions say no fabric softener products; ok but so many wrinkles resulted. Claims to be 100% cotton but does not perform as cotton does; more like a blend of some kind. Still it is a good addition to layering for a casual feel.
2.0,Liked the color and the fit in the back but the cleavage was way too much for my taste. Wish they had this color in a halter style tankini instead without too much push up. Sent it back.
2.0,"Small and cute, is what I would say if I could even get them to properly shut. It's really, really difficult. The silver one arrived broken (which is the one I wanted out of the three) in which it did not have the 'clicker' mechanism and basically remained open."
2.0,The quality was really cheep.  I immediately sent it back.
2.0,"This watch looks good and was &#34;cool&#34; for my 9-year old but when we tried to figure out how to adjust the settings on the watch, we were all completely lost!  It came with 24-hour time and we couldn't figure out how to change it to 12-hour time.  So good watch for kids and I guess a learning tool for military time, if that's what you want."
2.0,"did not realize it was embellished with an embroidery design. That did not show in the photo, so I have given it to my sister. Was not what I expected."
2.0,"You expect it with cheap Amazon fashion which is why I typically don't purchase RTW here, but this was really thin, low quality, and the seam between the top and the skirt was so poorly constructed it made the skirt hit at an odd angle and was super unflattering."
2.0,"This is a really pretty sports bra, but the shoulder straps are not adjustable."
2.0,Had theses for less than a year wearing them maybe 4 times. They have already broke. The controller also sucks. The range for the controller is horrible. Have to put it right next to the shoe
2.0,The shirt quality is good.  The skirt quality isn't great.  It's ok for the price.
2.0,These are just awkward and shapeless but comfy to sit around my house. I would not leave the house in these pants.
2.0,Somebody needs to look and see what a National Defense Medal looks like.  The hat I received that part of the ribbon isn't correct.
2.0,"See photo, bought in April and already broken"
2.0,"This product arrived damage in several ways and is on its way to being returned (handles dented, loose threads, rip in one of the handles with fabric coming out). While I still love the bag, I'm hesitant to re-order it in the fear that it may arrived damaged again. Can I get a new one for the price I paid for with Prime and assured that it won't be damaged?"
2.0,Very cute dress but too small! Had to give it to my sister.
2.0,So tight the pattern in the socks gets imprinted into your leg.  That can’t be good.
2.0,"Runs small, I'm usually a size small, ordered a medium and it's still small. Very thin, and nothing spectacular"
2.0,"The top is full length, like it could tuck into the skirt, not cropped, and it doesnt have the stripes around the bottom of the top like advertised in the pictures. The material is not as thick or tight as I'd hope either. The skirt was too big for me around the waist. I'm a small but I ordered it a size up because I've heard that it's so short. The medium is still so short. Debating whether I'm going to take it to a seamstress or just return it for a different seller."
2.0,"Fit is awful. I'm usually a US ladies size 8, so I bought a medium. It fit ok length wise and across the chest, but it hangs like a bag from there. No shape, no &#34;fit&#34;, it's like a bulky babydoll style that I don't care for at all.<br />I bought this right before a vacation and, being out of town and then busy, I missed the return window. Oh well. Guess I'll donate it."
2.0,"They're just basic racer back tank tops. I was hoping they would offer some ""jiggle control"" but that was not to be. Maybe I'm just to jiggly for control. To make matters worse, the white shirt is dingy looking, like when you accidentally wash a white item with the darks.<br /><br />Overall, just meh."
2.0,not the same length<br />size up
2.0,It runs small and I will send back
2.0,Runs very small for the size stated for both top and bottom. Also the cut of the pants are more like girls' pants than boys' in real life.
2.0,These are not progressive lens.  They are bifocals.  Returned them.
2.0,"Missing one of the pins that hold the band to the watch. Once I found one, it fits."
2.0,"Much smaller than depicted. Overpriced and took a long time to arrive. Overall quite dissatisfied, expensive to return not sure what I'll do with it."
2.0,Wrong shape (narrow) lens for US  glasses
2.0,Inaccurate sizing
2.0,If it is too small then there's nothing else to be said.
2.0,"Color is great. Nice looking belt. Fits nice, i am a 30 waist and bought a 34. But now its cracking and falling apart. Very disappointed."
2.0,Don't even last for a few hrs
2.0,Very disappointed in these uggs. I have owned many pairs of UGGS and have never had this happen. I bought these back in October and only wear them occasionally around the house and maybe once to run errands. I went to put them on the other day and there was a hole on the side that I could stick my finger threw. I don't know if these are 100 %authentic. I have had uggs in the past hold up for 3 years that don't compare the the quality of these. Wanted to love these.
2.0,I loved everything about my new bracelet. Was pretty copper color and very shiny for a while. Then I started noticing the little glittered diamonds started falling off the one with the glass diamond bar on it. Then the copper started wearing off. So it’s all dingy looking. It not something I’d put my money into to get another one. But I will say it was very pretty for about a month. It fits very nice. Didn’t catch on anything.
2.0,"While I love how this pendant looks, the bail was not on the pendant properly and the stone fell off somewhere. I was lucky enough to find it and I ordered a jewelry making set so that I could replace it. I would love to give this way more stars but it was super frustrating to have to order parts to fix it. It was less frustrating than trying to return it but frustrating nonetheless. This is the 2nd necklace of this type that I have ordered from this store and it is also the 2nd necklace that I have had to fix. However, all of the other jewelry I have ordered from this store has been awesome so, I don't really know what the issue is with this specific necklace. I will continue to order from this store but this necklace/pendant was very disappointing."
2.0,"Would Like to exchange for smaller size; Besides, the delivery driver run over it several times before bring it to my house.  I was very disappointed as you would when I return it for Size L instead.  Have not had time off from work to do so."
2.0,"This dress is a silky material which I was not expecting. I may have missed that part of the description. The body fits nice but the bodice is too big and it’s see through (even on the black dress). I also don’t like that the inside is white so when you walk, the white shows. I will be returning it."
2.0,"smaller than expected, poor quality"
2.0,"The mask was cute,  but unfortunately the way the masks is folded/creased you can't tell what it is when it's on.  Otherwise good quality"
2.0,The dress is completely see through. Will be returning.
2.0,Too small.  Too tight. Inconsistent quality.
2.0,Very pretty color but the sizing is way off either the jacket's way too tight in the pants are too big and very thinly made
2.0,Extremely small. I gave them to my elementary age child. I would size up x 3
2.0,I realized that the glue holging the crystal on is not sturdy enough to hold on.<br />Fell off less than month.<br />I did love the necklaces though.<br /> I was disappointed when I looked in the mirror and realized that my crystal was missing
2.0,I wear a small and it was WAY to big. I would've needed an XXS.
2.0,"This was a christmas gift for a nephew. Arrived a day early which was great. Coat is cool but it came with unexpected dirt marks down the front of the coat right out of packaging. Tried to lightly clean it as to not smear markings, but it was a stain that was already set. Bummer. Just FYI for those wondering XXL is about a an XL in US sizes."
2.0,"Product doesn't come with instructions.<br />Also, as a 36D, these stick well but barely cover my chest."
2.0,"Too big, uncomfortable fit"
2.0,"Very sheer, see through, would have to use as an under shirt."
2.0,"I bought a size up from my regular size, but the sleeves and the back panel may as well have been from a size s/m. The sleeves were tight, and there is not enough fabric across the back of the shoulders to actually reach forward. The rest of the dress was a little roomy, but I had bought up a size in case."
2.0,"Although small, the sweater is more medium/large."
2.0,"These &#34;pants&#34; were way too large in size Large for me and I am not a small woman. The waist felt as if someone had already worn them and really stretched the waist band.<br />To me also the fabric was very uncomfortable.<br />Basically, I felt like these are OVER-SIZED CULOTTES  that I could make in about 40 minutes on my sewing machine and pay about $12.00 to $15.00 for the material (maybe less)."
2.0,Very thin material and fits small.
2.0,Too large for my 2 year old.
2.0,The wrist band is huge. Im a big guy and i can wear it on thr smallest size hole. Just makes for an annoying extra long excess strap. Would probably fit your ankle better. The nylon is bette than the rubber strap that came on it. I dont get that sweaty stuck rubber feeling anymore.
2.0,"This face veil is cool. I use it as a scarf. The fabric is soft enough to wear around neck, but very coarsely woven together. Also, the spacing of the fabric's mesh is much larger than what appears in the photos, so large, you can easily seen through it. This veil is made in Pakistan. So if you like originality, this can be a cool fact. Despite all that, for what it is, at $12, I think it's overpriced."
2.0,Bathing suit is gorgeous but on the small size scale
2.0,"UPDATE 10/20/15:<br />I noticed over the past few weeks one of my clips was starting to fail.  I was disappointed, considering these were $20.  I contacted Buttons & Pleats through Amazon to ask for a replacement.  They responded very quickly and said they would send another set out.  They also said:  &#34; please be aware that cheap shirt stays can be lasted for less than 1 month, our product are designed to be last for 2-3 months.<br /> That mean it is normal to purchase new pack every 3 months.&#34;<br /><br />If you look above at the description of the product it says:  &#34;SURE GRIP CLIPS - Nylon teeth keep a tight hold on your clothing, ensuring a no-fail grip.&#34; and &#34;Made to stand the test of time, the BUTTONS & PLEATS Shirt Stays are a solution that you can count on to keep your shirt tucked in.&#34;<br /><br />- The grip has failed on me after 2 months.<br />-2 months is not what any reasonable person would consider to be the &#34;test of time.&#34;<br /><br />If the manufacturer was more transparent that these are disposable and need frequent replacement, it would have played a role in my decision whether to drop $20 on them.  I really like what they do until they stop doing it.<br /><br />Original Review:<br />This review is for the foot loop style.  The clips work great and hold your shirt in place all day.  I was concerned about the elastic being noticeable when seated but it hasn't been an issue.<br /><br />The one BIG problem that I couldn't deal with were the buckles.  When sitting at my desk or driving (I commute about 40 minutes to work, each way, every day), the plastic buckles dug into the side of my right thigh and were painfully uncomfortable.  Just for reference, I'm not a huge guy.  I'm about 5'7&#34; and 195 lbs.  I ended up removing the buckles and sewing the top and bottom section together at the right length for me and it's significantly more comfortable.  I wouldn't have been able to wear them out of the box, long term."
2.0,Loved it at first but the silver is changing colors
2.0,"Pretty design but poorly executed.  The sewing was gathered on the side seams, because of the double layer of material in the front, it pulled across the back so the pleats do not lay.  I was really disappointed in this because I liked the design.  I couldn't even wear it!!!!"
2.0,It said it was true to size but it was way too small for me. Other purchases I have made fit so I do not believe this is true to size. Beautiful dress however. Wish I could wear it!!
2.0,"Looked very awkward, not for plus size women"
2.0,Thicker material than I wanted in the bodice and too tight. Too lazy to return it. Will donate to good will.
2.0,"I'm a barely B cup girl. I bought a large and it barely coveted my chest and I had extreme side boob. The rest of the dress fit okay, maybe a little big. I am not sure if ordering a size up would even make a difference... it has a really weird cut. The dress itself would be cute on someone with a very small chest though!"
2.0,Clasp broke after 2 months.
2.0,One arrived defective and didn't have time to deal with it before leaving on our trip.
2.0,The product immediately snags and is not very soft. Size is true but not worth buying again.
2.0,"Nice and soft fabric. Medium was perfect length for me (5’5” ish). However, this was huuuuuuge! The medium was like an xxl. Three of me could have fit in it, honestly."
2.0,"The jacket looked great, unfortunately the size was not accurate. I’d have to get a size up for it to fit me. Also, there were no gloves with the package as pictured."
2.0,It was really cute but it had a wonky zipper that got stuck halfway open so I returned. They were out of stock so I wasn’t able to get a replacement for the same price.
2.0,"I gave it a 2 stars for the color combination which we needed for the family pictures.  Looks great....and we stop there!<br />Fabric is totally synthetic and see through, more like very thin plastic...be careful when you iron or it will melt, not worth the $29.99."
2.0,"These looked cool when they arrived, and fit well at first, but they started stretching out and falling apart after only 2-3 kickboxing sessions. They're sort of loose on my feet now, which is obviously not ideal, and the rubber sole of one of them cracked. I'm going to be looking for a new pair at some point, but making the best of these for now."
2.0,"I buy a lot of statement jewelry and sadly, this necklace feels cheap. Weak metal. Unique look tho!"
2.0,This watch was really pretty and seemed nicely made but he had it for 2 days and it stopped working. Not sure if it was the battery but it shouldn't be stopping 2 days after activated. I returned it.
2.0,Jacket cut smaller than normal size
2.0,"I searched for “maternity yoga leggings” on Amazon and these came up in the results. I had previously used Tesla both pre-pregnancy, during pregnancy and post partum. They changed their design so I was trying to find ones like the older ones I purchased. These are exactly like the Tesla ones. They seem fine but they are definitely not suitable for maternity. I’m 23 weeks with my second and the large does not have enough give in the waist to accommodate much more growing. The thing I hate the most is that these have a thicker seam around the very top. If they didn’t, they would be just like my old Tesla ones (which are also not maternity) but the upper band and thick seam make it impossible to wear for pregnancy. Returning and will have to order maternity ones instead. I had hoped to get non-maternity to get more wear out of them but sadly these will not work."
2.0,I had high hopes for this dress but it was super boxy.
2.0,"Had to return. The elastic was very tight, but the bust area was way too big (it was an indecently deep v-neck, and it needed to be sewn shut). The skirt slit also was WAY too high. Just unflattering."
2.0,"Very small, like a child size"
2.0,"I got this for my daughter's homecoming. It arrived today in the mail & is even more beautiful than the picture. However, it will NOT OPEN!! I wish I would have read the reviews before I brought this item. Many of other buyers have had the same issue. I don't have time to return it so I feel this was just a waste of my money! Which is very unfortunate because it is a very beautiful item!"
2.0,Was disappointed when I received this. The quality isn’t that great and some of the poles are crooked and don’t screw on correctly. Not worth the money at all.
2.0,They fit good and feel good. But in the description it says straps are removable. The straps are NOT removable. I only bought this because it says they are. I am NOT happy about that. Do NOT tell people something about a product knowing its not true!! I did give 2 stars because they are comfortable and rhe straps are adjustable like the description says.
2.0,They are very cute but after the first wear you can see where the fabric meets the sole the color was wearing thin and looks very cheaply made. Too much money for the quality.
2.0,I completely agree that the color of the gold looks blatantly cheap. I really don't understand how anyone could be expected to wear this alongside any other gold pieces. Hate it.
2.0,Not very durable. Have had to fix a piece of the buckle twice.
2.0,Not as great as I expected
2.0,These lens are not yellow.
2.0,"Could not get them on. followed instructions, washed before trying to put on."
2.0,Good quality. The glasses were freaking huge though!
2.0,"While these earrings are nice quality, they are a FRACTION of the size pictured.  I was stunned at how small they actually are.  They are more suited for a young girl."
2.0,I guess there's no way to have leg warmers that stay put.  I have to constantly pull them up.  Nice colors though.
2.0,Looks great.  Really heavy. Size ran small so these were exchanged for a larger size.
2.0,The snaps holding the nose bridge piece ripped out after the first use.
2.0,It’s very cute but it did not last very long. I can no longer use the stand part because it just gives way
2.0,These still show thru gals with larger with protrudidings . ...<br />was  disappointed
2.0,Wears very short and looks more of a bathing suit too barely covering chest.. wish it were longer for reference I gave 38DD
2.0,"It's a beautiful headband,  but it broke right away. It's because of its chain link design. If one get loosened they come apart."
2.0,"Material stretched to far. Very loose fitting to begin with. Nice design, love the buttons but most likely were meant to to be hand washed"
2.0,I bought these for my toddler daughter and they fell out the first time putting them in. I returned them hoping to get a refund but they sent me another pair. Waste of money and time. I should’ve went back to the place I got her ears pierced (Claire’s).
2.0,Runs super small. I wear a 6 in pants the xlg was too small. It was a cute skirt. I’m returning.
2.0,Me queda un poco pequeño y el color no es igual al de la fotografía
2.0,There is a lime green stripe in the scarf that I sent excepting so I returned it
2.0,"The name of this bag is misleading. I needed a locking briefcase and chose this one that says &#34;padlock&#34;. The padlock is fake and so is the key, so I am very disappointed about that as that was the main reason I got it. Other than that ridiculous feature, the bag looks professional and appears to likely last long. Inside of bag looks cheap though."
2.0,One of the stockings broke before I could even wear them out. The lace became detached from the stocking part. Definitely not recommended. Although I got use from the garter belt on a different pair of stockings and that seemed of better quality.
2.0,"Read the description carefully..<br />This necklace is so small, micro-meters..barely see it in the box..<br />Nicely presented and, it was only 60 bucks..but useless.<br />Returned."
2.0,"The cuff comes in waaaay too small, but okay, that's fine, the metal is very malleable, but it's thin! You adjust it too much, it breaks! It doesn't look anything like it does in the picture (although I'd gotten close to it) and the needle came back bent and disfigured. Honestly, it's cheaper compared to the others and for a good reason. These thing were probably mass produced. I recommend a different product.<br /><br />Any other product."
2.0,"blouse is large , but nice material, but it has terrible odor... It really stinks....... i have wash it. aired out ,  and it still has an odor, i guess i will wash it again, until i get this odor out...hopefully.... but i want buy it again....."
2.0,Material used was not good.  I put aside after less than a week of use.  Waste of money as far as I'm concerned.  Maybe some will get by with these.  But not me.
2.0,"BOUGHT THIS FOR MY 7 YEAR OLD SON, SPECIFICALLY BECAUSE IT WAS ""CHILD-SIZED"". THE MASK IS TOO BIG/LONG AND HANGS LOOSELY ON HIS FACE. DOES NOT FIT AN AVERAGE SIZE CHILD."
2.0,"These are adorable! I can give 5 stars for looks. But a 3 for size. My only issue is that they run extremely small!!!! Very deceptive. If you have a 5 year old, I recommend getting the size to fit a 8-10 year old. Definitely NOT true to size!!!"
2.0,i didn't like the fit and the back drove me crazy
2.0,"Felt flimsy and was on the small side of sizing, so I had to return it."
2.0,It didn't fit my face but it was an affordable mask so it's okay. I gave it to my coworker and she loved it.
2.0,"Purchased this for a party. Necklace came nicely packaged with a storage bag BUT alot of the gems were missing from the necklace once I opened it,probably would not purchase again."
2.0,More moomoo than sundress
2.0,I thought from the picture that the earrings where just flat metal but the ones I got had a glass dome over the metal. They were also big and heavy and something I wouldn't wear so I gave them to a female friend of mine.
2.0,Tough to match American to metric sizes. I had to order the next size up to get a match.
2.0,the old ones were noisy and warm<br />these are quieter and not as warm<br />noisy and warm better in my case
2.0,"Material is like likra elastic cheap had to return, love the style and color. Too bad on material."
2.0,it frays easily
2.0,The shirt was pretty but when I got it the shirt looked different.
2.0,I was excited to try this top on.  This top was put in the goodwill bag!  The arms are not comfortable at all
2.0,This top runs small so buy a size up.
2.0,"The pants were cute and fit nice while standing, but as soon as I sat they bulged in a weird way and really cut into my stomach and the zipper wouldn’t stay up. I wear a medium and that’s what I purchased. If you never sit down they are super cute!"
2.0,"I bought this thing because it was cheap, so in retrospect maybe I shouldn’t be complaining. But the watch band kept coming apart without any apparent reason, and every now and then it would just stop working and I had to shake it around or tap it hard to get it going again. I caved and bought a different one after maybe a month."
2.0,Came apart on the first day.
2.0,"Sound quality wasn’t that great and the speakers themselves stick out too much, looks like bulging blocks on each side of your ears."
2.0,Stitching wasn’t readable
2.0,Didn’t open wide at the top
2.0,Way too big n looked cheap to me. Glitter was ugly on it. My opinion
2.0,Very pretty. But not as flowy as it appears in the pictures. I returned.
2.0,"This is a nice size cute pendant, my only issue is the necklace, it's has rusted spots & closure is broken.  Not worth packing up & sending back."
2.0,Once I received the pajamas because I had no notification they were coming from China or I wouldn’t have bought them.  I found that the babies 9 month was way too small for a 8 month old that wear other 9 month clothing and they all fit fine.  One pair of the pajamas had one leg that was at least 4 inches too short.
2.0,"(Caveat:  I have changed my review downward after wearing these panties!)  This particular brand is cut badly, and falls below the belly button, and once on, they roll down and become quite uncomfortable.  I do not recommend this panty any longer!  I love this type of panty so much I have a dozen or more pairs!  They are great for travel and the hidden pocket is a great place to stash your passport or money (I usually put them into a plastic bag with seals first).  I got them for my sister and she also loves them.  The secret is to buy a size larger than you think you wear for good fit, and since they are quite elastic, you still get great support.  In this particular brand I would buy at least two to three sizes larger, and hope the cut suits your body.  They do not work for me, as they roll down and tuck in below my bikini line surgical scar, where my belly flaps over - exactly the part of my body I wanted the coverage for!"
2.0,Fit was awkward. Bought my normal size but runs smaller. Returned
2.0,"Here’s the thing; I can’t leave a good review because these aren’t right for someone with big boobs. But, that’s not the product or the sellers fault. If you have a larger chest and need support and LIFT stay away."
2.0,"My daughter loved it, and still has it, but the clasp broke within the first week of her wearing it."
2.0,Cheap material and the shape was not flattering.
2.0,The top was huge and the padding was weird and hard in the top then the bottom fit too small.
2.0,"This is a good case for the money, except it REEKS of china. It smells terrible and the smell has not gone away over the 2 months ive had it."
2.0,Great looking but they impeded my vision. They were too dark for proper viewing and I had a tough time seeing in general.
2.0,"Unfortunately I wanted to give this more stars but I wasn't able to n due to the sizing being off. My bf is 6'3 225 pounds and I got a 46/40. I am 5'7 and the jacket fit me perfectly. He never even bothered to put it on, it was clearly TOO SMALL.  Returned it the next day."
2.0,I like the loose stretchy material however not long enough for me
2.0,Too tight. Feels like blood circulation is being cut off
2.0,These came with no backs!!! They are bigger than pictured and cheap looking.
2.0,it busted the 2nd time wearing it
2.0,"it is small and cheap looking, very disappointed"
2.0,"Fit my son okay, but terrible material. After one wash they are pilled terrible, sticks to itself and every fiber possible (pet hair, lint, anything!) sticks to it and is impossible to get off."
2.0,Loved it when I first got it but unfortunately the color and glitter doesn’t last.. only been wearing it about two weeks or less.. not even to work or anything sweaty.. just around the house
2.0,Holes in both pockets a month after purchase. Very cheaply made. Ugh. It’s a very generous cut—super roomy. Just a big bummer to have to sew the pockets back together.
2.0,"S I Z E  U P ! ! !<br />No really, size up!<br />Bought a XXL as a gift while wrapping I was like dang I could wear this so I laid a size LARGE old navy sweat shirt on top of it for comparison. (See pics)<br />There’s no way the top would fit.<br />The pants are superrrrrr stretchy though and they probably could.<br />Super cute and seemingly well made."
2.0,While I appreciate the size I hate the lights. They are cool not warm so it lacks the ambiance we were looking for.
2.0,Way to small . Does it come in larger size ?
2.0,I BEEN BUYING THIS BRAND EVERY YR FOR XMAS .. TO BE HONEST WHEN I WAS READING THE REVIEWS I COULDN'T BELIEVE HOW MANY PEOPLE STATED THEY WERE ITCHY THE SIZE WAS OFF AND WOULD NEVER BUY AGAIN..I COULDN'T BELIEVE IT .. I LOVED EVER PAIR I HAVE PURCHASED..SO I TOOK A CHANCE ON THIS PAIR AND BOY ALL THE REVIEWS THAT I READ WHERE SPOT ON.  THESE OUR HORRIBLE I CAN'T BELIEVE THEY CAME FROM PAJAMAGRAM...TAKE MY WORD DONT BUY THIS PAIR YOU WONT BE HAPPY.....BUY A DIFFERENT PAIR FROM PAJAMAGRAM..JUST SAYING..
2.0,"Thin material, tight in the arms and chest.  Comes does to the belt line - a little too short for me, makes my gut peek out a little bit."
2.0,"I got these and was so in love. Comfy, fit me well. And then 2 wears later the area of the crack started splitting.<br />I can't find a way to contact their customers service to try and get a replacement so I'm just really disappointed."
2.0,"Size 6, ordered medium. Fabric is very soft and comfy BUT... the waistband is so tight I can’t sleep in it. Also went through the dryer and the cheap iron on print melted. Dried on medium heat. I loved the feel of the fabric so much I tried to make it work but not working, goin in the trash 😩"
2.0,Too large and waited too long to return
2.0,"I bought these after returning from Italy. I was on the coast and did not buy enough of these lovely bracelets as souvenirs. I turned to the internet to find Murano Glass Jewelry. They do not seem authentic, the ones I bought in Italy had a small charm logo that said ""Murano Glass"", you can see this on google images. These bracelets did not have that small charm. The metal also turned dark and dingy after only wearing it two days. Beware! One bracelet out of three ordered had a small printed Murano Glass fact sheet in the jewelry box. Anyone can print that. The ones I bought in Italy were $18 a piece, these are overpriced and not authentic."
2.0,I bought this for my fifteen year old grand daughter who loves dragons. She does not wear it. She told me it is too hard to put on.
2.0,Cheap material and fit is not good at all.  Stitching is crooked.
2.0,"I recently got the idea of getting gold dipped roses, and decided to try this one as one of the more expensive ones with a high rating (wish I had noted it only had one review). When it arrived, I excitedly opened it in front of my husband, son, and mother. The words that popped out of my son's mouth expressed my horrified reaction- &#34;Mom, that's just ugly, you wasted your money&#34;. All of us, three generations, agreed. The gold dipped edges were the worst- they looked like a young child who couldn't follow a line did them. Even the rose head itself didn't look preserved well, with odd dimples presumably from varnish. To give it credit, I thought maybe this is the way they look. So I tried ordering two more cheaper ones from different vendors. Despite being almost half the prices, those ones were absolutely stunning! (I've included three pics of this product, and one of those two for comparison.) As a result, I can only conclude that this product is just poorly done. What's worse, I almost gave up on the idea because of how bad it looks- so glad I didn't. In summary, I don’t recommend this product at all, and suggest you try others like Mr Pro or  ZJChao (the two others I tried in photos). This one is just an utter waste of money."
2.0,No me funcionó
2.0,Runs small! Size up!  The shoulder “poof” is much larger than in the photo.  Sent it back
2.0,"I was expecting a more loose fit in the back of the hat, but it is tight on my head and does not slouch as it looks. I would not buy another one."
2.0,"This dress would look so much better if the skirt liner was the same length as the dress. On the model, the knee length liner doesn't look bad but in person it doesn't look right. I also felt the dress was very saggy and didn't have much shape. It may look better on someone taller but on my 5'3 frame it didn't work out."
2.0,They were cute until the bottom rim broke the second time I put them on. Super flimsy.
2.0,"After just a short period of time the seams started to break.  I threw away after a couple months of use.  Looks like leather, is not and wears like thin vinyl.  Pretty, but would not recommend to anyone."
2.0,Wouldn’t open properly. Returned.
2.0,"The velcro is nice, the band does look a little cheap, but I don’t mind that too much. The material is decently comfortable. But the plastic clasp that connects to the Fitbit is so uncomfortable and the cut is rough so there are bits of plastic that pole and scrape you. Especially on the wrist area it hurts. If you have small wrists consider the ridge plastic doesn’t bend like some other straps. I wanted to like it. But the poorly cut plastic is a no for me."
2.0,"Shirt looks just like picture, however the material is very-very cheap. Starchy-rough feel shirt and buttons are very poor quality. Before I tried the shirt on a button popped off. After the first day wear, the button holes began to unravel. I should have returned it when I had the chance. Now it's a painting shirt. My opinion - save your money."
2.0,Good flare. Size fine. But thin material that you can see through. I bought the black pair and the material is too thin. My skin shows through.
2.0,Did not fit my daughter well at all. Disappointed.
2.0,"Based on other reviews I ordered a large (I'm 5'7 and am a size 6 or 8). It was way too big so I ordered a medium, and it still didn't fit. Not only that, but the medium was poorly sewn; the stitching was so wide that it definitely would've fallen apart after one wash. Returning both."
2.0,Love the fit of the skirt but that fabric is so thin you can see straight through it. Also the belt was way too tiny
2.0,color is not the color like in the picture...its a very bright coral /bright pink-ish color...
2.0,The color is perfect but they don’t hold tight on wrist and tend to get caught on clothes.
2.0,"Runs large, the material is poor quality"
2.0,Insanely cheap/thin material. Super see through.
2.0,"Poorly made, bought for my 13 year old but fit my 9 year old better."
2.0,Too busy for a watch band. Gave to a friend.
2.0,I bought one of these before in a large and it was like children underwear. I really wanted something like thing so I upsized to a xxl and it’s still too small! I wear a size medium in underwear and I understand these are shape wear so it’s gonna be a bit tight but I couldn’t get them up my thighs let alone my tights and stomach
2.0,It is a very cute top but it was not true to size. It fit tight not loose fitting at all.
2.0,"felt like lead.  i like to wear clothes i don't even know are there.  these were too heavy, like the lead vest worn for X-rays."
2.0,The quality of the design on the shirt is really poor. It looks like it will wash off in one wash.
2.0,"this thing was way too small.  unfortunately, i wasted money on this"
2.0,"The black was pretty sheer and the material was cheap and felt uncomfortable, but from far away it looks okay???"
2.0,This  necklace was made to look much larger than it really is in the pictures provided by the seller. This is the tiniest necklace I've ever seen. Not happy.
2.0,"2 stars for nice material. I ordered a size larger than my actual size, but unfortunately the arms are still tight for me. Everything else is fit just fine, length and width.  It would be nice if they use stretchy material for the arms.  I couldn't wear it and gave it away."
2.0,Ok. I’m going to be honest. Love the coat. It’s nice and warm and the length is perfect. Only crazy thing about this coat is that the zipper goes all the way to the tip of the hood....why I don’t know!  The zipper was very stiff and hard to move up and down but I did take a Bar of soap and rubbed it along the zipper several times. That made things better.
2.0,This is ugly ugly. If they had left that weird embroidery off this would have been cute. That is off color and uneven. I am going to work on removing it because the top is cute.
2.0,Very drapey and loose and didnt look good at all in this color
2.0,Kind of tarnished looking. Wasn't worth the 7.99
2.0,"The suit is very cute.  I'm not happy with the support.  To me, it is not a &#34;Push Up&#34; tankini."
2.0,"I was hoping for a non-shiny cotton-type fabric. Also, the shoulders are a little narrower on this dress than on many others, and the sleeves hit me just below the elbow bone and would catch on my elbows. If you don't mind a shiny cotton, you might like this one, but it wasn't for me."
2.0,Too short!!!!! They need to consider US sizes when importing to the USA!!!!!! Too short even for a PETITE woman
2.0,"This product is smaller than it appears.  Very hard to get items into it. It's good for drivers license and possible passport,  but not a wallet."
2.0,Beautiful color yellow but runs really small.
2.0,I wouldn't recommend this glove for anything more than a onetime wear to compliment or completer a costume for a Halloween party of something. My arrived with a hole on the tip of the index finger and I had to super glue the tear up since I needed it for a costume the following night. If you are looking for a glove for a ceremony or something don't get this one.
2.0,"I liked the quality, but the color was kind of dingy and the fit was weird. Too short (I am only 5'3&#34;) and it made me look like a marshmallow - not in a cute way. Going to buy a different style of Wantdo, because I liked the construction of the coat, just not the style. I will buy black next time, because I think that will be more slimming."
2.0,I had high hopes for these jeans. The fit was so odd and they weren’t even stretchy. I was dying for motto jeans for so long. These are super super skinny towards the bottom of the legs and huge at the top. It’s just oddly proportioned in my opinion.
2.0,"Too short.  I don’t like my skin showing, these are too short.  Needs at least one or two inches.  They are shorter than my dress socks"
2.0,"Such a beautiful dress on the hanger but fit so poorly on a curvy figure. The waist fit me well but the top would not stay up, was not wearable."
2.0,This looks like a nice jacket.  I bought it for my 13th old son who normally wears a boys 16 husky or men's small. I ordered the men's X small and it fits him nicely. HOWEVER the coat smells like a chemical plant. We had to put it outside because the odor was so strong it was making me dizzy.  We've had it outside for 2 days and it still smells awful. You can taste the chemicals in the air. Tried contacting seller to see if there's some way to treat the coat to get the smell out and have not gotten a reply.
2.0,Poorly sewn and somewhat misshapen.  The colors are also much less high contrast than shown in the photo.  Returned.
2.0,Very poor quality with one seam torn!
2.0,"Shipping took a while but still came faster than the expected date range. No tracking available despite giving me a number and carrier. Quality is good, strong string and no visible loose ends or anything that could potentially unravel.<br /><br />Came as 5 bundles of 10 bracelets, each bundle contained multiples of the exact same type of bracelet. The bundles themselves differed from each other but only slightly. Nothing like what the pictures they show for advertising. I received all the same style but the colors were slightly changed up, in all of the bundles it's the same colors just in a different order going down the bracelet. Pictures advertised show many different types of styles and weaves, there were all one weave with just different colored strings used for each bundle.<br /><br />Overall the bracelets are of good quality and vibrant colors. The problem lies with the lack of diversity. If I were giving out these in a goody bag of some sort it would work well, but I was under the impression I would get an assortment and could give them out to friends. Very cheap price, but not a good buy if you were looking to use these for a more intimate gift giving experience between close friends, instead you have 50-odd bracelets that would work better for giving out to a class of students as rewards or such. Could find better places to buy various bracelets for the same price."
2.0,Not super flattering on me and I was too lazy to return it
2.0,i use a large but it fit big<br />i like things lose but i should have ordered a medium. i needed it right away so i couldn't returned it.
2.0,"This was more fitted than the shirt shown on the model.  Also the material is that weird kinda see through polyester type.  I thought maybe Id keep it and crop it but that was not an improvement.  Overall, I really don’t like anything about it and only wear it to sleep in."
2.0,It is as hard to use as hooking the bracelet.
2.0,"Item is in tact and gold does not seem to be peeling/tarnishing. But the pendant dot is SO SMALL! I wanted something dainty, but not something the size of a freckle!"
2.0,Good gloves but will deteriorate after a few months of use.  I bought two sets of these gloves and both started to have issues after 2.5 months of use.  Zippers will break and the material of the glove will degrade resulting in holes.
2.0,pretty cheap.
2.0,"I've purchased over a dozen pair of shoes from Smile.Amazon.Com. Every single time, regardless of manufacturer, a size 9. Not one problem. Always fit. These are far too large."
2.0,"If only it lasted. Noticed this hole shortly after wearing for the second time (first time was just around the house for an hour in the evening, so don't thing anything caused it here). Love it and would purchase again if I thought it would hold up. I'll update if customer support addresses."
2.0,Love the color! The cotton material is very poor.  So cheap.  Very rough and ugly. Not soft at all.<br />At least the good strong color camouflages the material.<br /> I will not buy again.
2.0,Too big in the waist long length legs
2.0,"Comfortable enough. Had them a couple months and they already have a hole. Simple, light mechanical use. Won't buy this brand again!"
2.0,"Size not accurate. I purchased North Face gloves before and size always fit, these run so small can’t begin to get these on."
2.0,All three tanks were different sizes. Green fit perfect. Gray was a little smaller and black was even smaller and felt as if it were made from a different material.
2.0,"I put a size 10 in my cart. It automatically changed it to a size 13. I figured it was some sort of sizing adjustment.  What I got in the mail was a size 19? They're huge. They are cute though so I'm keeping them hoping they'll fit my son in a year or 2. Won't be buying from this seller again, however."
2.0,Broke in the first hour
2.0,"Man, this was so hard to get on. I'm a size L/12 on top and a 14 on the bottom. Length was not a problem as i am a little over 5'10&#34;. As one who has some shoulder issues and pain in my thumbs, trying to get tihs on didnt help. I love the bittersweet cuz its so hard to find brown in anything these days. To get this on comfortably, i wouldve needed an XXXL. The turtleneck neck part was really lose, though."
2.0,"Product runs small. I usually wear an xl. After washing this product and wearing about 10hours, I felt like my breast was about to explode. I continued to wear it thinking I’ll stretch it out.... I just ended up cutting off my blood circulation."
2.0,"These are the cutest bunny earrings I have ever seen... unfortunately, they are so dainty that they are flimsy. They do not last. My 13-year-old daughter wore them maybe three times, and the stem broke off of one of them, and the other one is completely bent. Sad because we loved them so much."
2.0,the ring did not fit
2.0,Broke shortly after receiving from the stress of expanding over wrist while putting on and taking off
2.0,"I give this hat a two star rating. Those two stars are for the awesome quality, look, and feel of the hat. Sadly, the fact that (as others have mentioned) the sizing is so off, this alone defeats the purpose of the hat as a product. I am normally a Medium and I cannot wear this hat, as it is far too small."
2.0,"I purchased the pink, but I received this horrible, pasty-colored blouse that can't qualify as pink; I was very disappointed. The fit was okay, but the blouse would be better if it were made of cotton instead of polyester, which is not very flattering. Zanzea, use material that is pink rather than a pasty peach, use cotton instead of polyester, and all would be well. The design on the sleeve is very nice."
2.0,They were small and looked cheap.
2.0,"Hat is fine quality. The lettering is a shiny iron on, it is NOT embroidered. It’s super cheap and unattractive. Super disappointed."
2.0,Loved they style but it was too wide for my fingers and uncomfortable
2.0,Expected to have higher quality for price paid.
2.0,These look great but didn’t last long. They are plastic and stripped out really fast.
2.0,"This is a review of the TT8 floral print dress. Perhaps the model pictured is only 4 feet tall and has 12-inch-long arms.  Otherwise, there is no way the dress would drape so beautifully over her forearms and hang to her ankles.  I am only 5’6”, but with this dress on, I look like Chummy, the gawky Amazon-height nurse from Call the Midwife, wearing a too-short baggy pillowcase.  Repulsive.<br /><br />The sleeves are tight and end 4 inches above my elbow.  The hem falls 3 inches below my knee.  The print on the fabric is beautiful, but the arm and dress length are terrible."
2.0,They just give everything a yellow tinge.  They don't stop the glare.
2.0,"I ordered the ""Ecrocoo Womens V Neck Casual Fall Dress Fashion Loose Short Sleeves T Shirt Dress Boho Beach Dress,Orange S""  First -the pattern is just not me.  Second - a small is huge on me.  5'2, 110#s.  Fabric is poly so would be good for just hanging out Just not attractive at all so sending it back."
2.0,Bigger then what I thought was going to be
2.0,"This fits extremely small. I ordered a size larger than my normal size to leave some extra room, and it was like 4 inches from being able to zip at the bust/ upper rib area. If you are large chested this dress likely won't work for you. Also the sleeves have no give to them so although they fit fine when you move around they kind of pull. Too bad because it's very pretty and flattering, but if you decide to order definitely order at least 1 or 2 sizes up."
2.0,"You definitely need to set aside time to do this project. You have to be very precise in gluing the pieces, otherwise the whole thing is shifted. Looks great, but I underestimated the project."
2.0,I usually wear a large. This dress ran really small.
2.0,"Much shorter than pictured.  I am 5'4&#34; and ordered the XL.  It is plenty roomy, but about 5&#34; shorter than pictured, either the model is a dwarf or the jacket design is different than pictured."
2.0,"Lasted for about 10 wears, then literally snapped in half."
2.0,"warm and looks as described, quality of fabric is poor and it is almost like felt after one wash"
2.0,They are high waist but look weird pulled up so it's too bunchy at the top.
2.0,"While advertised as “11 wide”, they are not a wide width and feel about half a size small in the length too. The size marked inside the boot also does not indicate wide. Boot quality seems okay, but too small!"
2.0,Way too tight! Even three sizes up won't do it!
2.0,"UPDATE: first wash, it shrunk so much. Terribly disappointed!<br />A little small, but that’s ok. I’m mostly disappointed in the quality. I can’t see the print lasting more than a wash or two."
2.0,"Fit & function are good. The knee pads work well. But if you are buying this for PRS, don’t. I had to shoot off a stage that involved quickly going from standing to squatting & the pant just ripped off, the cloth not stitching."
2.0,NOT meant for muscular thighs and a booty. The extra fabric in the crotch region was pulled tight by my booty and rested literally under my a$$ on my crack. V uncomfortable.
2.0,"I love these dresses so I ordered 4 from the same product page - 3 of them were print and one was solid. Now the print dresses I love and they’re 100% polyester. I was so disappointed and even checked the tag; 100% polyester for the printed dresses and 95% cotton/5% spandex for the solid dress. Now the description clearly says 96% polyester and 6% spandex for floral; 95% cotton and 5% spandex for the solids yet as you can see from my pictures, that’s wrong. I don’t recommend the solid dresses whatsoever, especially if you like the material of the printed ones, which are silkier, wrinkle resistant and feel a lot better against your skin. The cotton dresses wrinkle very easy, shrink in the dryer and you HAVE to iron them after washing."
2.0,Soft and silky. Works great but definitely not meant for sleeping or with some with a lot of hair. I have a lot of hair and they do not stay on nor do they stay put when sleeping. I will wake up and see it fell off. So annoying
2.0,"The shirt sizes are not as expected,  I had to exchange for a different size and the company wanted me to pay shipping.  Also shirt appears as though it would be a sweatshirt type material but isn't,  material is weird and not comfortable."
2.0,So the hat and gloves have like an extra layer of material on the inside so your kids head and hands don’t go all the way in it . So for the hat it feels like it doesn’t fit on right and the gloves make I hard for my daughter to hold anything since it’s like she can push her hands in far enough .
2.0,Low quality of material; seems “rough” especially for a kid. Bought it for the cat pattern but unfortunately I would not recommend or purchase again.
2.0,This ring is not sterling silver. It started to turn my finger green where it was. And there is no 925 imprint.
2.0,"Very small, would probably fit an 6yr old"
2.0,"I ordered this, and it worked for a while.  It just stopped - no display.  I am disappointed."
2.0,I didn’t like the this product was pointy in the Breast area and runs big in that area as well
2.0,Not so great as i thought.  There was something  sharp on the inside that I had grind off
2.0,I wore it once and it already broke but I guess shouldn't expect much for the price. I was just excited to finally receive it and then it didn't even last an hr! :/
2.0,"If you are an adult, more than likely it wont fit on you. I have a relatively small face and it was too small. Fits my 10 year old sons face wonderfully."
2.0,Ordered these beginning of November for the cold weather. They say they are for construction but barely last a month before they ripped. I do not recommend these to anyone for does construction
2.0,I love the way this dress looks in the pictures but it was too short. It fell at about an inch above my ankles. Also the skirt starts just below the bust so i felt it had more of a maternity look. Returned and bummed
2.0,The blue stone came out the first time I wore it and some were gum ball machine ring adjustable. Others were ok
2.0,"Its much smaller, thinner than inflated pictures folks. should be $2.00"
2.0,"The first bracelet I put on unraveled within 3 days. That was disappointing. I fear wearing any of the others for long periods of time, which is negating the point of my purchase. I gave 2 stars because I can at least use them for the short periods of time."
2.0,All of these must be made in China because all 3 different ones I've tried separate after a couple months. waste of money!
2.0,too small size design
2.0,"Sorry, I just did not like the bright pink flowers on the very dark navy blouse  Way too dark and the flowers were kind of cheesy looking"
2.0,Hadn't like the way they fit will keep but want order them again
2.0,Cute top but extremely short
2.0,"Returned this skirt because it's not stretchy material as described in the title. I admit I did not notice the zipper in the pictures. It's pretty, though."
2.0,THOUGHT IT WOULD BE MORE LIKE A BEANIE THAN A SKULL CAP AS DEPICTED IN PICTURE.  DISAPPOINTED!!
2.0,Definitely not at eye catching (sparkly) as what I saw from the seller.
2.0,Nice style and material but too large.
2.0,"Bought for eldest son who is very slim - 31/32 waist pant size. The mediums were way too tight for him in the waist which seems odd, since he's almost a small in many things. Very unhappy about the sizing."
2.0,"product was too small even though I ordered the correct size. If it would've fit, I would've liked it. Thankfully it was a hassle free return."
2.0,"I know it's not an expensive pocket watch, but the engine is not as detailed as it appeared in the ""ad"". Plus, and more egregious, the ""gold"" extends into the ""silver""  beyond the borders of the train image. The train is in relief, which is good. Luckily it's for my young son who isn't likely to notice those details."
2.0,I have purchased this bracelet 2 times already and the clasp hooks have broken each time. It is a nice bracelet but only if you don't mind taking it off at the end of the each day. The clasp is also very small and hard to attach... I had my daughter put it on for me.
2.0,"These are just ok. The ball on the end of the nose bone is too tiny and I end up losing them or catching them as they fall out of my nose. Good thing its a large pack, already lost 3."
2.0,"I should have listened to other reviewers!!! This watch is very cute, and I love wearing it, but it definitely does NOT tell the correct time. I probably got about one week of wear with the correct time. I'm a teacher and cannot have my phone with me all day; I need my watch to be accurate so I and my students can stay on schedule throughout the day. I wish it was only a few minutes off, I would continue to reset it every morning, but it is WAY off (slow). I am SO disappointed that this only worked for a week. The only reason I am giving it two stars is because the picture does accurately represent the look of the watch, and it is very cute. If you're looking for a fashion item, this is a great choice. If you're looking to tell time, pick another watch. :("
2.0,"Wow, this ended up being huge!  I don't think I can salvage it.  Pretty fabric, but way too big."
2.0,The view is distorted and makes you dizzy
2.0,Material was not plush velvet as expected.
2.0,"I like the idea that they were fleeced lined, so I could wear while snowshoeing, but they are way too small.  I take a size 8, or medium in any other jeans, but not these.  The quality is good but not the size.  Gave them to my daughter who is a size 2.  Too much hassle to send back since they came from China.  They must run towards junior sizes then misses."
2.0,"Not what they used to be. Very disappointed with quality. Minimal wear on these, second pair I’ve thrown away."
2.0,"Excellent material and pattern, but so bulky that it's not flattering on a shorter, heavier body type. The material was a little too thick and bulked up in unflattering areas. I'm not obese, and I'm definitely not tall or thin... I'm pleasantly shump(short and plump!).  But this dress is not made for that body style. I can see it flattering a taller, much thinner body type. I'm returning it."
2.0,They're too wide and don't fit on my head.
2.0,The blue is a LOT darker than the pic.
2.0,It's way too big and doesn't fit in the locker. I wish I could return it. Don't bother
2.0,"Thought it was super cute. Wore it once, ripped almost immediately at the back where the strap connects to the dress. Other side is starting to rip also. Super bummed. It was not tight on me and I do t have big heavy breasts to hold up, it is just cheaply made."
2.0,"Way too short, as in showing off that belly. Don’t lift your arms too high fellas. Logo also started flaking off after only the first wash."
2.0,"Goggles were great, until they broke after just two months of light use. The plastic clip is very weak and snapped. I'd recommend spending a few extra dollars and buying goggles with a little more integrity. The swim cap is also very tiny."
2.0,"It looked way less cool on me than it did in the pictures. The cut-out detailing doesn't look intentional. It looks like the shirt is ripped, or someone cut it."
2.0,Too Heavy but very attractive
2.0,They were way too small for a women’s size 8 shoe
2.0,"Super short! I’m 5’ 8” for reference and it was like a shirt on me. Not a fan at al! Definitely returned it, I gave it two stars because it was a good a material"
2.0,What you see is not what you get… The photo leather is very fun and cheap
2.0,One sock has a tiny hole
2.0,Cute but definitely not the size I ordered. 6-9 month is the size of a newborn size.
2.0,It’s cute but the material is not good both of my purchases both of their sewings are so bad it’s about to rip .... I want a refund in gift card or replacements!
2.0,"Material is comfy and a bit stretchy, which is nice. There is a raised seam around waistline that’s cuts the dress off, as if it now needs a belt to cover that. It’s semi flattering but too long."
2.0,Size was way off ordered XL is more like a medium
2.0,"...but it definitely doesn't fit mine. The only way to wear it with your ears comfortably through the loops is to cover your entire face – eyes included! If you pull it down enough so that it just covers nose and mouth, it tugs the top of your ears way down. Pretty useless."
2.0,It's not the same as the picture
2.0,Baggy chest area
2.0,"I wanted to love this watch. But there are just too many issues for the price. Day two of wearing and one of the pieces on the strap broke. And I've been babying this thing. Another issue is the hands aren't oriented with the lines for accurate time keeping. Seriously disappointed, and will be skipping this brand next time."
2.0,The metal closing broke after 1 time
2.0,Quickly fell apart during first run.
2.0,Falls off and clasp has started showing serious signs of wear after only a couple months
2.0,"At first, I loved them. After a few months, the sole on the right split and wore out. The weird thing is that I am in a wheelchair. I had to order a new pair of slippers from a different supplier...<br /><br />I recommend not buying these slippers from this supplier..."
2.0,"Fits very small. I mean I am somewhat of a big guy, but the shirt is made in Korea. I guess 2xl Koreans are similar to a medium US. It's wearable, but its similar to a dry fit compression shirt from Under Armour or Nike."
2.0,"Not at all like the picture!! Very cheap, item reflects price. Mine has a bright white spec of resin on outside of ball. Very disappointing!!"
2.0,Cheap material that stretches weird when worn. The underwire is also squeaky. Sadly returning.
2.0,"HATED THE DESIGNS, WEREN'T AS DESCRIBED AT ALL. DIDNT OPEN, STILL CHARGED ME 1/4 OF THE PRICE FOR SHIPPING. AND I BOUGHT 2 PACKS. RUDE."
2.0,"This tie is NOT for boys, is for babies. It's really cute but is incorrectly advertised. I ordered it for my 9 yr old, had to return it."
2.0,I love the style of this sweater but the fabric is SUPER ITCHY! It irritated my skin so much that I had a rash on my chest & shoulders after a few hours of wear. Very disappointing.
2.0,"Returning it. Color was a bit off, just not vibrant, and the fit of the top was just wonky-- probably fine on thin and smaller busted people. Fabric was a weird thick pebbly type that seemed like it would be way uncomfortable for summer. The buttons down the middle were sewn haphazardly on a strip of fabric that was sewn down the middle on the dress so it flopped around and there were tons of extra strings from where it looked like there were buttons but then they moved them or something."
2.0,I ordered a medium but they sent me a small. The white pants/lining shows so much through the pants fabric that it looks cheap
2.0,"Overly poofy and oddly made as though it belongs on a child or a doll. It is not elegant, rather childish or costume like."
2.0,Sizing was off. This is gigantic.
2.0,"The band is fine, but the case thingee is awful. It doesn’t fit correctly, so there is no point it even putting it on."
2.0,"If you like your clothes transparent this is for you,  gotta love those pointy shoulders that hang off too."
2.0,plastic leather ? hand sewn? handle are so ready to pull out of the bag even before i fill the bag up
2.0,"This is not panama straw, and so they shipped it flattened.<br />The hat has never recovered its intended shape."
2.0,I was so happy when i was taking the slide out of the package but when i saw my right shoe i was disappointed it was damaged very unhappy
2.0,"I'm 5'2, and weigh somewhere between 160 and 190 (I don't have a scale, I'm just going off what I've seen at the doctor's office in recent memory). I'm not skinny, there's definitely some extra padding around my middle. That being said, these shorts felt weird and made me look frumpy. I'll be returning them."
2.0,"Super adorable, BUT:<br />Pros-true to size, vibrant colors, nicely made<br />Cons-thick polyester,  not flowy at all, extremely short in person, and the slit is sewn.<br />I was looking fprward to wesring this ine night at the beach however its extremely thick and short!"
2.0,"These earrings are not okay, nothing fancy or spectacular about them"
2.0,Looks good however the back opening doesn't allow the buttons to touch your skin - which is the whole point.
2.0,The openings didn’t fit any of my sunglasses. Had to give this away. Seems to fit small Ear piece (like avaiators) vs most female sunglasses (even Ray-bans).
2.0,This shirt seems cheap and is way too small.  Very disappointed.
2.0,"Pretty, but, they would not stay clasped"
2.0,"Ring is turning a rose color, I bought because it specifically said .925"
2.0,"If you ladies wear a size, 38DD and up, please don't waste your time. The top has no support for heavy chested women.  I ordered the XL which the top and bottoms were to small. I normally wear a L in my bottoms, depending on the fabric. The colors are cute, but just right. Also, majority of my butt is hanging out, you would think it's a thong lol.,"
2.0,The color was not the same I really wanted the color that was shown.
2.0,I’m normally wear a medium but got a large to lounge around and clean in they were so tight as if they were an small almost an extra small. Size up more then normal.
2.0,Very very sad gave my mother for mother’s day and not even wearing 8 hours sitting at a graduation this is coming apart at the seams and she loves the dress ..... 25$ plus for this dress and can not even wear one day - this is so disappointing
2.0,"I ordered an XL, normally I’m a L, and it was still way too tight on the arms! The material is very soft but I have a feeling it won’t survive very many washes :("
2.0,"Not happy but love this shirt. After only one month, 3 wears, it's falling a part. Big hole in the armpit."
2.0,"Received this package before Christmas, only to find out in Christmas Day that's the black bracelet was broken. Very disappointed."
2.0,Runs small and shrinks!
2.0,Charms and the whole bracelet falls apart after a couple of hours very brittle
2.0,"Too much spandex for me, returned"
2.0,"The underwear are soft and cute, not high quality material though."
2.0,"My daughter just turned 11 and while tall for gymnastics, I expected the Large to fit.  We'll try the XL instead."
2.0,So pretty but it broke very soon
2.0,I've only worn these about 10 times and the metal hinge broke and now I can't wear them.  Of course it's past the date I Can return them.
2.0,These will definitely not magnetize over the width of a nipple. I have tiny nipples and still wasn’t strong enough magnet. They’re super cute but I really wanted fake nip rings and this wasn’t it at alllllll
2.0,Simply inexpensive jewelry.
2.0,It ripped only 2 weeks using it!!!!
2.0,Not recommended. Used it for a week. Very uncomfortable.
2.0,"Very nice color of blue, however, the skirt is very slim fitting and is thin. I need a slip to wear under it, but the fit is so slim that it isn't possible to wear one underneath."
2.0,I returned this. Super sheer and just all over weird fit
2.0,"The vest only works well if it's buttoned; otherwise if you leave it open then the material inside it hangs out and it looks pretty bad.  And it is too small on me to button it up, even though I ordered an XL which is what all my other clothes are.  If it wasn't such a pain, I'd definitely be returning this.  I'm going to try to give it away to someone it might actually fit."
2.0,"Tiny, tiny, tiny! They are a gift that I'll be a little embarrassed to give because the earrings are baby sized. I know they have a little gold, but are mostly silver. Should be bigger."
2.0,Only giving it 2 stars because it’s not the color yellow it is more of an orange color but the quality is there. It is a very soft beanie.
2.0,"The print of this swimsuit is absolutely stunning. The cut, however, leaves much to be desired. While I don't have an exceptionally long torso, the part that you'd want to sit under the breasts was so low it was mid-way across my stomach. While that doesn't affect the deep-V style it looked absolutely foolish. The suit fit through the butt and everywhere else so I don't think sizing up would have done anything more than making it extra baggy and look worse. Pretty disappointed. I had ordered more than one color during a sale because I liked the style so much, but they all were sent back."
2.0,"NICE BAG,<br />BUT RAILS ARE FLIMSY, WHEELS ARE SMALL FOR A LARGE BAG."
2.0,No button fly and extremely long. I am 6’1” and they came past my knees. Had to return.
2.0,"This thing is too big, too bulky, and change purse is horrible because you can't see into the pouch area, and the change keeps falling out."
2.0,Very cheap so I will only wear this if I need it for a costume on Halloween.
2.0,Came all wrinkled.  The material is cheap and flimsy and the garment has no shape.  I am usually a medium but order 1 size larger as I have issues in the past with online orders. It was about two sizes bigger than it needed to be.  I ordered a large and a small would have worked. Am returning it.
2.0,"Returned:<br />•Fabric is lightweight but See-through!<br />•Sized TWO sizes too small.<br />•Bit short; so if you raise your arms when you workout, this will untuck/show skin.<br />•Fabric is Static-prone"
2.0,Shiney and very heavy. Gave two stars because it is the first inexpensive maxi dress that came with a lining which is nice but in turn it made the dress super heavy.
2.0,This belt is for women it's too fine
2.0,I needed this for tomorrow and received only the outside.  Can’t wear it without the inside!  So disappointed.
2.0,My hat had a bump on top of the patch it looks really bad
2.0,"It was too small, it was bought for my younger brother but it didn't quite fit so it was a letdown. Asian sizing is VERY different and so the Medium fits like a XS (for a kid basically). There is an option to return it but it would mean you have to pay for it to be shipped back so instead I kept it as they suggested. Then they gave me back 10% as an apology, which I found better than nothing so that's why I give it two stars. The quality is pretty standard for a winter coat, the inner liner is just wacky."
2.0,Very pretty- broke in a week
2.0,"Nice shorts, but not true to size. These run small. I normally wear a six, which according to their chart would have been the small. I ordered the medium anyway and they are extra tight. If they shrink at all in the wash they'll be a total waste. Not really worth the $19."
2.0,"This dress looks like it cinches in the middle but when worn, it falls straight down"
2.0,Rhinestones peeled off after a week
2.0,Did not like the fabric of this apron.
2.0,Shirt was way too small I typically wear a medium but it felt like an extra small. The sleeves wear also cut very weird and was not flattering to wear.
2.0,Cute but runs extremely small. Son couldn't wear them.
2.0,They were suppose to for plus size n boy they were far from it!!  I would've returned if it wasn't for the fact that they ended up fitting my 12 year old who is very slim. But they are nice material n fit her just fine
2.0,"The caps are good quality and feel really soft, but the buttons are sewn into the back of the cap instead of over the ears which means once I tie it, the buttons are lost in the knot and not accessible anymore for me to hook a mask on."
2.0,"These are more plastic then Latex, they don’t stretch nearly as much and they break rather easily.  They will do, but I won’t be purchasing these again."
2.0,"I ordered the green cape for my moth costume, specifically because it had the luna moth tails on it. Not only is it not green at all (it's blue and purple) but it isn't even the same shape. I've triple-checked my order to make sure I ordered the right one, and it's similar in pattern, but it's not what I thought I was ordering. It's still solid quality and will make a nice costume."
2.0,This dress was beautiful and it fit as expected. There was a huge imperfection in the front of the dress and I️ had to send it back.
2.0,I don't like as much as I thought the cap is too big for my head and the ears flap up like wings they don't rest on your ears
2.0,Liked the color the fit is too small.
2.0,"I wanted to love these, but... I was hoping they fit & felt as good as oofos. Do yourself a favor and buy oofos!"
2.0,"Overall the items are OK. Cheaper looking in hand then in the visuals provided. 6 of 12 of the cherries arrived broken, as in beads separated from the stem. You will likely need to put time in to repair and nicely clean and glue the item before use. Maybe spend a bit more and find a better item elsewhere."
2.0,"The material is good, the color is really nice. But, the collar and the picture is crooked. My wife says the collar is really loose. And she had to go with 2 sizes up."
2.0,Would be fine if it actually fit. Order 2 sizes up. I usually wear a 6. Should have gotten like a size 12 or something
2.0,Stitch came apart after first trial. Returned it...
2.0,"It was exactly the shape I wanted! Loved the color love the space. But, where I didn’t take it out every time, it hadn’t gone with me everywhere. I finally decided that I wanted it for my full time purse, even to work. But, I didn’t know it needed to be returned so quickly if there was a problem- so after I started using it daily, within a week or two tops, when I started losing things that I always put in the same pocket. I then realized the sewing in the pocket had come undone- now two zip pockets are losing things (faulty sewing) . I tried to find the sellers email, because I like to give them a chance to make it right- but all I could find was that ‘this sale is closed the return deadline was a month after purchase. It has been over a month, but where I didn’t start I suing it for a little bit.. I thought maybe I could reach out.. but nothing. Which is s shame because I really liked the purse otherwise."
2.0,It was stiff and very uncomfortable.
2.0,"Not very durable! After only 2.5wks of near daily use (just for school) the laces on both shoes are broken from adjusting and the velvety parts look very tattered. I’m guessing my son wasn’t the gentlest on them, but 2.5wks?  I’m bummed, cuz we’ve never had shoes die this quickly! I left 2 stars cuz they are great in rainy weather as advertised"
2.0,"Not right size for adult, for my 5years old boy fits well, and it uses very bad plus material， just wear two times can throw away now, because after wash, it looks so ugly, I would find a better one!"
2.0,The quality & appearance were less than I expected.
2.0,did not fit as expected
2.0,Comfortable fit and well sized pockets but quality is suspect. A button fell off during the first time the shorts were washed in the washing machine. That's below expectations for shorts I haven't even worn yet.
2.0,Bought XL. I usually wear XL. Way too small.
2.0,[[VIDEOID:3dd2f9a92e03c7f40c1fc9509877ec95]] The color looks blurry and not detailed like the picture. Does fit well and love the adjustable ear stopers
2.0,Fits weird.  Almost like it wasn’t assembled correctly.  Cheap looking.
2.0,"This is the 2nd time I’ve ordered and will be returning these. I ordered the +1.5 strength and keep getting +2.0. The outer box label says they are +1.5, but the glasses are actually +2.0. They are otherwise fine glasses and great to have a few pairs around the house. I have ordered them before in the +1.0 strength, but my vision needs have changed so I wanted new, stronger ones. Guess I have to try another brand."
2.0,It’s a harder plastic. Not as soft as I would like. Still seems to be comfortable. My biggest complaint is the color. Is more clear then shown in the picture. I wanted what was advertised and definitely got less than. Would not order again.
2.0,This product was not just big. It almost swallowed my little girl. My stepmother had to cut 3 inches off of it lengthwise and then take it in an inch and a half just to get it close..
2.0,Extremely hard 2 get off& on ! I am returning the sizing is totally OFF !  Could not use them at all & truly left us in a bind!
2.0,The socks get shorter as they stretch wider to go around the calf.  Not good if you wanted knee socks and have big legs.
2.0,"Purchased for my daughter and her first time wearing the cuff, the pearl fell off.  They are better looking in the picture then in real life, poor purchase on my behalf."
2.0,It does not look like the picture. Feels like the cheap version of Nike. Not sure if it's original.
2.0,The soles make the shoes unstable and makes it very easy to roll an ankle. Too bad because they are cute.
2.0,Cute dress very see through and a cheap material. Will rip easily. Tight fit in chest area.
2.0,"I guess I should be flattered that there isn’t enough room for my boys in these.  I haven’t done a lot of comparisons, but would wager these aren’t going to offer sufficient coverage for an adult male."
2.0,"With XL size, the waist of this sweatpant is too low! You almost always have to pull up your pant and make sure it does not drop down to your knees and embarrassed yourself! I like the zippers on the pockets however."
2.0,Too small. Not as big as I expected or wanted
2.0,Fits perfect and the material is comfortable. Looks great at first. I really loved it until I washed it for the first time. Still kind of cute but the velvet lines are the reason I purchased. Kind of like buying a graphic design shirt and then it peels after you wash it 😖
2.0,it's for very tiny wrists
2.0,has a weird sheen and stitching color isn't a good match - i purchased the moss green one
2.0,it appeared larger than it was
2.0,it fits really weird. it is too long and it definitely came in a size way too small and i even got a size bigger then i usually do. my breasts barely fit in it.
2.0,Product smells really bad and color fade in your skin
2.0,I was disappointed to that the picture showed the cap as plain black while the one I received was almost completely covered in a silver sparkly design. That is something that I would have liked to have know. The cap is not plain black.
2.0,These kept falling out or sticking out when i tried wearing them.
2.0,"The dress sizes are way off. I wear 18W. So I ordered XXL and the dress was still to small. If you can find the correct size, it is a nice dress to buy. I love the material."
2.0,Looks like an awkward bathing suit
2.0,fit like a plus size not a large
2.0,I ordered size xxl but when I tried them on they were xl. (too tight).
2.0,Found the stitches already loosen after unboxing the cap. That's not good enough.
2.0,"The watch itself needs a new battery , Looked really nice but didn't function"
2.0,The extra large dresses like a medium it didn't fit over a 34 chest
2.0,Not a rounded front .. front comes to a point and makes the F in fades unreadable
2.0,These were super uncomfortable where the straps cross on top of the foot. They were also really wide and fit weirdly. I returned them
2.0,I’m 5’6” and these were awkwardly short on me. I have a longer torso and average/shorter legs as well. They also had these pleats in the front that caused the pants to puff out awkwardly at the hips. The massive pockets also add volume to the hip area as well so these were extremely unflattering. Wouldn’t get those unless your like 5’2” with narrow hips?
2.0,They are huge. I can’t even wear them.  I order acccording to size chart and I need at least 2 size smaller.
2.0,"Very uncomfortable, but kids liked it for play."
2.0,"Very cute but definitely not “squat proof”. A little too see through for me to wear out in public and definitely not to the gym. Bought a large based on some reviews saying to size up but that made them baggy in the knees and lower leg for me, however if I would have bought my true size medium I’m afraid they would have been even MORE see through in the butt and thighs. A long shirt would have covered that fine but that also would have covered the cutest part of the design which was the wide belt print."
2.0,Loved it but I can't wear it because after 1 day it turned my finger green.
2.0,"I don't like the item. It looks great online, but not in real life. The style, fit, and feel of the material is not very good, seems harsh on the skin. Not comfortable at all. I can't return, so I'll donate to charity."
2.0,Dress was extremely static cling straight from the bag.  The material was a very soft t-shirt like material. I don't why there was so much static on the dress. It made it very hard to try on and keep from sticking to my entire body.  Sending it back.
2.0,"It was stitched all wrong, the ruffles were HUGE and uneven and made no sense. It looked super weird and unflattering, I can't imagine who or what body type this could've been made for."
2.0,"This is a nice cap...BUT it is NOT a snap back cap.  It is a ""one size fits all"" cap that is NOT adjustable and runs large.  The circumference of the cap has an elastic ""band"" that is not at all snug.  If you wear a hat size of 7 3/8 or smaller, this thing is gonna be way too big for you.  Just sayin'."
2.0,"I spent a lot of time trying to figure out how to put the top together, but just couldn't figure it out. Returned it."
2.0,poor quality. Didn't like it
2.0,"I really like wristology watches, but I had to give this one a thumbs down. The hands are NOT silver, they’re black and basically invisible. With the glare from lights, it’s almost impossible to read quickly. I’m very dissapoinred that the watch is not as pictured. Also, the wrist band is significantly shorter than the mesh ones, so the watch is much tighter on my wrist, as I have wide wrists. Two stars only because the quality of the mechanics seems to be on par with the two others I have from them. I would return it, but I need it for an event and don’t have time to get a different one."
2.0,"I have bought several of these over the past few years and the first few pairs were great. My latest order however came directly from China, and had a major decrease in overall quality. The lenses are not nearly as dark as my previous orders, and the frames do not sit the same. The finish on them appears to be of lesser quality as well. Really bummed as I loved these glasses previously."
2.0,I loved them until I woke up and the lock piece went missing.  Does not lock well.
2.0,"This onesie is comfortable enough, but the fact that it arrived with a noticeable stain on the inside back / shoulder blade area is a deal-breaker for me. There should be better quality control than this.<br /><br />The seller can contact me if they want to try to make this right, but for now, I'm giving this 2 stars and even that is generous IMO, given that no piece of clothing should arrive already stained."
2.0,Started pealing and coming apart after two weeks don’t waste ur money
2.0,The fit was wrong. The mesh in middle creates an off fit to this Leo
2.0,Downgrading my review from 4* to 2* - one wash and they are too small to wear again. Disappointing<br /><br />Original review: Bought a size up after reading other reviews. Fit perfectly then.<br />Pros: Very flattering on (got an unsolicited “your butt looks good in those pants” from hubby! Lol) pockets are great phone holders!<br />Great color - will likely buy another color.<br />Material thick enough to camouflage most panty lines.<br /><br />Cons: the drawstring is kinda cheap white twine and picked up the color of the pants when I washed them.  A means to secure pockets closed would be nice.
2.0,The fabric feels nice but it fits two sizes too small even though I ordered my correct size. Almost makes me think it’s a kids or teen sizing rather than adults.
2.0,They left my package outside while it was raining first off but the shoe box and shoes were dry I guess. Then I come to open then and they're bigger than my whole arm. But the looked nice
2.0,"I was looking forward to wearing this jacket.  Unfortunately, the X-Large fits REALLY snug.  It is very uncomfortable.  And, it's a Men's size.  Not a Junior.  So, I'm very perplexed as to why they call it an X-Large.  I would have to get an XX-Large in order to fit comfortably.  All of my other shirts and jackets are X-Large because of my shoulders.  It is a nice jacket though.  You can unzip the back of the color to reveal a hood.  And it's a windbreaker that is water resistant.  Too bad I can't use it."
2.0,"Super cute shoes that fit great, however, I've worn them a total of three times and the elastic section of the straps are hanging on by a few threads. I can't wear them again until I get them fixed at a shoe repair shop."
2.0,"Product fit well, but was very see through."
2.0,"Hela costumes are hard to come by.  There's a super cheap version that gets horrible reviews so I didn't even try it.  There are elaborate cosplay costumes but I'm not willing to spend $200+ on them.  This one was somewhere in the middle, but I still think it's overpriced for what I got.  First of all, the sizes are weird.  I guess the size chart is accurate, but not all slim people are short.  I'm 5'6 but my other measurements corresponded with a size small so that's what I got.  It's way too short in the legs (although arms were fine) so I'll have to have my feet stick out and tuck the bottoms into boots.  Other than being short, the rest fit fine so I wouldn't try a larger size because then it would be baggy.  Oddly enough, even though the costume was about 5 inches too short for me, the cape dragged on the ground a couple inches.  Someone who would actually be the right height for this costume would have 6+ inches of cape hanging on the ground.  The other issue is that the cape isn't even close to matching the green of the bodysuit.  Honestly, I'll probably end up keeping this because I have a kid who wants to be Thor for Halloween and insists on me being Hela, but otherwise I would return it.  I'm keeping my eye out for something better that's not super pricey."
2.0,I tried the trick of using a bra pad to fix this and was left with the above picture making the lovely triangle shape. I tried a million different ways to fix this because I liked the feel of the fabric and they didn’t slide down on me but I cannot wear these out in public. I’m 5’9” and 180lbs.
2.0,"When I took them out of the package the rear button strap came apart. The rivet holding them on is defective/incomplete and does not work.  I will be returning them. Too bad, otherwise they looked nice."
2.0,If using more than a few cards (.7-10) you can not remove 1 card without taking the band off
2.0,These lenses did not fit the Spy Optic McCoy frames.
2.0,The quality is fine but there were no measurement so o wasn’t sure what size to order thus what is received is too small.
2.0,"Really cute and comfy on my son’s feet. The soles did look used on arrival, but that didn’t matter to us really. However, the toes scuffed within a handful of wears and he can’t wear them in wet environments anymore because it goes through to his socks. I just bought these less than two months ago, and I have his grandparents offering to buy him new shoes."
2.0,The fit is fine. The quality is the problem.y daughter has worn the dress for a few hours and already I’m proving spots where the seams are coming apart. The bottom stripes on the dress are not as pictured. It is a different fabric of thin stripes.
2.0,Wore it once. Eyelet rivet came off.
2.0,"They look cool and my friends thought the glow in the dark detail was neat, however, after the first time removing to clean the glass fronts popped off. This only after one week. I would not buy again"
2.0,Size is not true.  I ordered and received the size 9 (supposedly fits 9. to 9.5 measurement) My hand 9.5 inches at the knuckles did not even begin to fit into the first 3 inches of the glove.  Now I have to send it back and guess at a size 12 maybe?
2.0,"I'm not sure if I've ever worn chiffon, so that's on me, but this fabric doesn't breath at all -- I feel like my skin is suffocating in it, and I grew very warm very quickly. Even though its sheer, it's heavy -- I was hoping for something airy, but this feels like gravity is constantly pulling on it. Despite being kind of slippery, the fabric is also slightly scratchy -- it reminds me of polyester. While the sleeves are fine when I put my arms down, they make it hard to put my arms out in front of me. It's also not as green as I hoped (to be fair, they did warn the colour might be off thanks to the monitor) -- very drab, almost grey. Thankfully, it wasn't too expensive -- I hate doing returns ...."
2.0,I'm a size 22 . It was not plus size at all. Too small to close . Maybe I can re-purpose it as a duster...
2.0,"Do Not Like, want to send back but I have no idea where to send them too?? They are HUGE and I went by their chart."
2.0,I’m sad I just got these five days ago they fit great feel so soft but the inside is separating from the bottoms.
2.0,Mmm Kind of... for an old man.
2.0,The shirt is very high quality but it runs soooo small!! I’m sad because I was really looking forward to wearing this. I’m 5’6” and 124lbs but a medium was skin tight. I’m not even sure what size to order as an exchange because the medium was so tiny. Do I get an extra large? Would that be huge or tiny. My frame of reference is very confused now. If the company helps me out here a bit then I’d be happy to update my review with a higher rating but first I need an item I can wear!!
2.0,The velcro stopped sticking after 2 weeks of use. Basically unwearable at this point.
2.0,"It was love at first sight when I came across this necklace on Amazon. However, I am now disappointed upon its arrival.<br />The Good -  The chain length,  design and detail of the peace sign, along with the stones and beads are all great.<br />The Bad - Arrived missing a teal stone at the top of the pendant."
2.0,The beading is not symmetrical and is uneven.
2.0,"son thought they were the coolest for the first few weeks. After about 10 days, the lights starting going out. ( yes we charged them) the charge only holds a few hours at most."
2.0,This item was cut poorly and it had a fit that was tight in some areas where it looked sort of twisted. I never wore it and rather than going to the trouble of trying to return it I just put it in a donation bin.
2.0,I ordered this when there weren't any reviews. I didn't realize it was a thong or I wouldn't have ordered. The colors look really pretty on my skin tone but it was too stretched out around the upper boob area. I'm pretty petite 5'3 128lbs 34b and bigger bum but the top part was toooo big and the bottom too small.
2.0,"Be forewarned, the description says, &#34;ironing needed.&#34; No option, after laundering these, you will have to iron them because laundering and drying them renders them generally unusable until they are ironed. These are a poor choice unless you already have a habit of ironing your handkerchiefs,  On the other hand if you do already iron handkerchiefs, you'll find these neat and attractive once they are ironed."
2.0,"I waited 3 weeks for these booties and was really disappointed upon receipt. The booties are very, VERY long. Yes, LONG. Long and extremely pointy. Pointy to the point of being ridiculous. The red is a true RED RED RED but the shiny overlay makes them look cheap. They look almost plastic. These had to go back. I'm a true 6.5 but by reviews I ordered a size 6. Still WAY too long."
2.0,Disappointed.  Not warm.  Not a Nike down jacket.  Imposter jacket.
2.0,Strap is back wards so it is hard to use middle compartment
2.0,"Nice material, and would have been a good dress, but the arm holes were WAY too small. I ordered a 2XL and had another dress that I ordered through amazon, and comparing the two, the arms on this dress didn't work. It was also too short and not burgundy."
2.0,Cheaply made<br />Broke after first time wearing
2.0,The Clip broke in about two weeks.
2.0,"I typically wear a medium so I decided to buy a large just in case and it still fit me tight, and after I washed it it didn’t fit at all."
2.0,Looked Cheap
2.0,[[VIDEOID:f12b637f079788a79026610e8488b064]] Soft material but the shirt has no hems on the arms or waist. You can tell where it is cut and unfinished. Disappointed.
2.0,Looks longer than in the pic. Quality is good.
2.0,I like this product for what they are.  I specifically searched for “tank with shelf bra”.  These are not.  Extremely sheer with no liner.  Disappointing!!
2.0,"It's cute but too small, so had to return it."
2.0,Too small and rip easily. Wore them once and already have a whole in my butt and they weren't even that tight.
2.0,I got the large for my daughter that wears a C cup. But it barely covered anything. Returning it. Good quality tho.
2.0,The length and with were fine. But the strap across the top of your toes is not adjustable nor does it have any stretch.  They are not for adult feet. I had to give them to a 14 year old.
2.0,This dress seemed a bit tight above the waist with a good fit in the waist. The material at the top was thin and did not look appealing when on.
2.0,has a weird smell and it isn't soft at all it is kind of a scratchy material. Wasn't what i expected
2.0,Very pretty and sparkly. However I CANNOT wear it because its sharp at every corner setting and very bulky. Doesn't sit comfortably at all between toes and cannot walk with it. Possibly a pinky ring but not for me.
2.0,"beautiful necklace, but the chain is definitely not 18&#34; long...waste of time to order something and not receive as described :("
2.0,"I'm keeping this only because it would work in a pinch for things with a lower back. It does not work well for backless and it certainly cannot be worn with anything skin tight since the straps that have to be wrapped around your waist show heavily if you do not have a toned tummy. This only has one hook and all of my bras have two hooks, so that was also something to adjust to. Overall I was not very satisfied, but it would work in a pinch."
2.0,"Picture makes it seem as if it's engraved.<br />It's actually poorly printed and sealed onto the metal heart. Not awful, but wouldn't have purchased if it looked this cheap."
2.0,Zippers were all defective. Lining bunches up.
2.0,"I'm typically an XL in tops.  This was really big through out the body of the shirt,  and the arms are really tight.  It a shame... really liked the look of it."
2.0,The bustier area fall apart just with one use. Very disappointing
2.0,Bad selection and quality is not so great.
2.0,Very cheaply made... Too small and very tight fitting.
2.0,"This skirt is not high waisted. I am 5' 9&#34; and based on the description I expected it to be at my ankle. Too short, and there are loose threads everywhere on the waist. Very disappointed. Will be returning."
2.0,Material cheap<br />I expected better quality
2.0,"very pretty, but not stretchy,  would not be able to wear it on the beach or in the water because it's metal."
2.0,ROBE IT SELF VERY NICE NOTHING WRONG WITH ROBE. THE SIZE IS NOT LIKE USA SIZES I ORDERED A SMALL 4 WHICH SHOULD BE BIGGER THEN 4T WHICH IS A TODDLER BUT THE 4 WAS LIKE A 1 IN A KIDS SIZE. NEED TO RETURN FOR BIGGER SIZE.
2.0,hard to clasp.
2.0,The shirt is too small for the advertised size. The colors faded away after the first wash.
2.0,Me quedo vien solo que la tela allego muy delgada
2.0,This very small huggie earring is perfect for any time of day with any kind of dress for any kind of occasion: from grocery shopping to that little black dress!  Classic and stylish.  You'll wear them 24/7 they are so comfortable.  Uh oh.  Back lever broke 3rd time wearing.  Too thin.
2.0,These definitely slip around if not secured right the first time. Once you peel it off to readjust the adhesive just gives up. I had to readjust these constantly and the inner sole wouldn't even fit in my shoe right (it made the shoe feel tighter so it wasnt that useful) they helped with blistering and comfort but all the readjusting and extra work made it a chore. Will never buy or use again.
2.0,"I wanted mostly cotton socks because my feet sweat in my work shoes. The description said 80% cotton, but they are not cotton, mostly polyester. They are pretty socks, just not cotton."
2.0,"Cute dress, but way too see through. Very thin material!  Returning."
2.0,"They are soft and have a slight sticky grips on the bottom but they don't have any elastic around the top and they are pretty loose now. Pretty much fall off while I walk. The pink bows fell off the green polka dot one and there is a hole in the heel of the black star one after one wash. I wouldn't recommend these, get fuzzy socks instead."
2.0,Very small size and cheap stitching
2.0,"This is a beautiful top, but the fact that it’s labeled One Size, is a joke!! It’s more like an XS that is short!! So all you tiny girls & Ladies out there w/flat tummies & wanna show it off, this top is for you!!"
2.0,[[ASIN:B000WFWHAY EARRING DISPLAY / HOLDER (BLACK METAL) - HARP SHAPE ~ HOLDS OVER 125 PAIRS and SHIPS FREE!!]]<br />This item is a lot smaller than I thought it would be and only holds max. 35 pair of earrings and is way too expensive for its size.
2.0,Dress came up to high in the front and the back. Selected right size.
2.0,Great Quality but run super big! Might want get a size smaller
2.0,"The taper on the band is signifcant and changes the character of the band.<br />It is very prone to sweat discoloration. I lived in VA where summers can get hot. Sweat caused the band to permanently change colors and get a strong oder.<br />The plastic black attachments to the lugs are large, which take away from the leather feel of the band.<br />I would not recommend this product when many  others good ones are available."
2.0,much too small for size ordered
2.0,"Took awhile to arrive. Not modern push button open, all manual open and close."
2.0,"I was assuming when I received this that it would be cotton, but it is not cotton at all! It's some sort of spandex material. I was very disappointed."
2.0,"Cute shoe but it has yet to make it out the door. It bothers my daughter immediately and she changes. Consequently, it is never worn."
2.0,This is a little too loose around the nose for me As a woman. Will work for running but I would i wouldn’t recommend elsewhere
2.0,"Does not fit!  There is a reason why the picture shows the girls foot on her toes!  The second or third picture should show the jewelry flat footed when viewing the jewelry foot ware.  I did not get to upset because the price is inexpensive so who cares.  I also bought the exact one for a friend of mine and had it mailed to her through Amazon.  We are going to a yoga retreat together and I thought these would look cute.  Unfortunately,  she said the same thing about hers!!  Did not look very good on her.  We just laughed because it is not a life changing moment.  I tossed mine in the trash and kept it moving."
2.0,The item was smaller than expected. The quality was ok but I wish the part with the wording was a little bigger.
2.0,Sleeves made out of lycra (like bike pants)<br />Looked weird in person<br />Returned
2.0,"Clunky and uncomfortable, makes my nose hurt."
2.0,It was a lot bigger than I expected
2.0,Do not use if you plan on using this item with a caramel treatment or hair coloring. I find this to be a waste of money but can be used for mixing.
2.0,"Photo shows the charm as very bright and shiny. When it arrived (quickly and on time- that was nice at least) the charm was very dull. Both the metal and the 'gems'. They look like paste gems, and are dull, and two were missing."
2.0,"I really wanted to love these CowCow dresses since their patterns are so cute, however, the fit of the dress is very awkward and not appealing at all. The dresses are tight in the chest and too large everywhere else, the fit is just plain awkward looking which was a huge disappointment since they look so cute in the photo, but that is not how it fits in reality. I returned mine and had to pay for shipping, not impressed, wouldn't buy again."
2.0,Was nice when I first bought it but it didn't last long. It got dirty really fast and I had to buy a new one.
2.0,"Looked better in the picture.  Had to reshape the whole thing once it arrived.  Ended up not wearing it, made of a shear material and over all cheap looking."
2.0,Preety but no matter ehat i do it just stays wrinkled.  I havent even worn it because of that reason.  I love the involand brand but this item just wasn't the same quality as ither items i bought
2.0,Really nice fabric but darts in skirt portion do not lie properly so it was a poor fit for me and i fit most dresses in my size. In my opinion they need to rethink the cut of the skirt in waist area. Neckline was a bit poorly cut. I returned it.
2.0,"material doesn't breath well.  Would be fine for swimming, not so much for running or sports where sweating is involved."
2.0,"Super thin material. One size fits all? Only if you're under a size 8. My daughter is a size 2 and it fits her with a little extra to spare. If stretched too far, the fabric becomes see through."
2.0,disappointed with picture
2.0,Tassel fell off first time them putting on my boots.
2.0,"I loved this boot! The leather is soft, nice rubber sole and the fit gives my fee plenty of room to wiggle (no real arch support). The one and only thing that could have gone wrong with this boot did...within 2 weeks the zipper came off its track and doesn't go back on :-(.<br />Be prepared for a very chemical odor when you take these boots out of the package! I had to let mine air out a couple of days before wearing it."
2.0,The material and the feel is very nice..but I'm 110 and 5.2 and xsmall is too large for me..its too long and not flattering fit.
2.0,"Initially it did, but it broke after only a week.  However, the company response was excellent, and they made it right.  They need to rethink the design so it is more durable."
2.0,"Upon using the larger piece of luggage for the first time, one of the wheels came off. Now the smaller piece of luggage is missing both handles after arriving at the baggage claim on another flight. I like the luggage but the handles and wheels are not made well."
2.0,Run smaller than listed
2.0,Very cheaply made became frazzled and fuzzy within a week
2.0,they used to make a very soft cotton product - the quality is going down - seems like a harsher mesh material -
2.0,Did not look like the one on picture. It only covers half the face.
2.0,Larger than expected and came with rust on them ?
2.0,"Third time wearing this and, it broke!<br />The closure is hard to work and it came off today, 3 small pieces. Don’t think I can repair this myself.<br />Ok to look at, but not something I would recommend buying. I have purchased this brand several times and this is the only one I’ve had a problem with so far."
2.0,"Material is good quality, print is beautiful but it fits like a women's medium not a men's medium.  Order a size up"
2.0,The quality seemed ok but my granddaughter pointed out the wings and whiskers made them it was a dragon not a dinosaur costume
2.0,"Ordered a size larger and food great at the top but stood my stomach the top goes from loose fitting style, to really tight. I have a larger chest and would expect it to not fit up top, but it doesn't fit around my stomach. Its like a large top post of the shirt, but small bottom part."
2.0,It was a very itchy material. I ordered an XL and it fit like a medium.
2.0,"I loved the look of these and wanted them to work. However, I rarely wear them because I'm so worried they will come out. I had it happen three times in just a few days. I've had other bioblast push-in labrets that stay in my lip just fine, but these just aren't snug enough unfortunately. Couple that with the fact they they are spikes, they catch on things more easily, expounding the problem."
2.0,The shorts are the right size. The shirt is definitely not. Way too big! Also the little flowed comes as an iron on decal....its not already on the shirt 🤦‍♀️
2.0,I love the looks however after the second wear it changed colors.
2.0,"Heavy and  very pretty, Taught it would  be good quality but its  not. It cannot be worn on a regular if you're a silver lover....After several wear It starts turning..."
2.0,Terrible optics.....
2.0,"I usually wear Danskos, but decided to try another brand. Unfortunately, that was a mistake.<br /><br />These shoes aren't comfortable. They are exceedingly tight (especially since they are listed as a wide width), and they put a lot of pressure on the ball of my foot. I'm an nursing instructor, and my first day in clinical was torture. I couldn't wait to get the shoes off my feet.<br /><br />Guess I'm going back to Danskos."
2.0,"I normally wear an XL, but was gifted this in a 1X.  It fits around, but is definitely short.  I don't think I will ever wear it because of this. I am 5'9 and it just barely reaches the top of my jeans."
2.0,"This looks so cute in the picture. But eas a big disappointment. It is very, very thin. You can't wear it for any kind of warmth and it's not the type of material you want against your skin on a hot day."
2.0,Very poor fit.  Product is way too tight.  Fabric is scratchy.
2.0,"Poor quality clothing.  After I washed them on gentle using gentle detergent, the length shrank quite a bit and the elastic waste is very uncomfortable, the fabric is very rough as well. Won't buy gain."
2.0,Arrived damaged. Mesh was torn in more than one spot. If you have anything smaller than DDs don’t bother with this gown because it will flatten you out like a surfboard. 😂😭
2.0,"Way too small, but cute. Wish it was comfortable."
2.0,"Purchased 7 sets within 4 days of each purchase. The 1st set cost 10.99, two days later 1 bought 6 more sets for my workout team and they cost 11.99. The very next day the price for the exact same item increased to 15.99. Unfortunately, these are not worth $16.00.... don’t buy, look elsewhere."
2.0,My boob popped out during my performance. One size does not fit all :(
2.0,"The bag is a lot smaller than expected.  It is still quite cute though.  My major issue was the fact that after 1 week of daily use, one side of the shoulder strap completely threaded out and came off in my hand, while the other side starting ripping off pieces of the bag itself.  This bag was of disappointingly poor quality."
2.0,Way too long and very different in terms of shape. The slit is not even in the same spot.
2.0,"Look nice, but runs very small, buy m, look small."
2.0,"not as expected. straps too lose and not equal on both sides, doesn't hold foot properly.<br />very lightweight. cheaply looking. length fit my size but width is very slender.<br />i expected the footbed to be different, it's material is not washable and a welcome nest for bacteria to breed."
2.0,"I love the color of this hat.  However, the picture shows the hat to be a medium-large size and there was no size given in the description.  When I received the hat, it was a small-medium size...too small.  Therefore, I had to return."
2.0,"This is a pretty decent product for the price, but sizing is way off compared to all other jewelry I have worn. I have been at 9/16 for years and every other plug I have worn has fit the same--the center of the plug is at 9/16 and the flare is a little larger. In the case of these plugs, the flare barely reaches 9/16. To make matters worse, the plugs aren't as deep as many out there. Nodding my head is enough to make them fall out.<br /><br />The attached photos are a comparison of some of my existing 9/16 jewelry (acrylic amber) and an Evevil plug from this set (light wood). I would recommend buying a size at least 1/16 larger than you usually wear."
2.0,I needed this dress for a wedding and got it the day before and it was really small:/ if I would have known I would have just ordered a larger size....
2.0,runs extremely small....about 3-4 sizes small and the fabric is very flimsy...
2.0,It was NOT a Fidus umbrella.
2.0,"Runs alittle to big, I returned it."
2.0,Good quality cap but didn’t have the caption I ordered. ‘Nessie ate my homework’ didn’t apply or fit with anyone on my list. Shipping took long enough I couldn’t get it exchanged before I needed the gift. I reordered from a different company to try again.
2.0,I was expecting it to be cotton. It's like a bathing suit material. Kinda disappointed. It'll be a house cleaning top.
2.0,After wearing this bracelet a few times in the shower it was obvious these are just painted beads. I guess you get what you pay for.
2.0,"The sunglasses i purchased are very cute.  I love them, but the left lens keeps popping out when I put them on.<br />What do I need to do to return them."
2.0,I thought the color would be a soft pink color. When I opended the box I found a neon dress. I reordered the same dress in black.
2.0,"Good as gloves, but only 1 finger sometimes works on touchscreens. The others never do."
2.0,The socks are too tight making it very difficult to put-on and take off.
2.0,Super small!  Ordered a 14-16 for my 13 year old who wears a 12...thinking he would be able to get at least a couple seasons out of the pants.  These pants look more like a youth medium.  Very disappointed.
2.0,"Pretty Jewelry Set if you're getting it for a child under 13 yrs. of age. Cheap materials, so don't expect it to last long past the ""Wow, that's pretty""  factor.  The chain isn't long at all.  I give it less than a week before it's unwearable.  But for the paltry cost of under $5 USD, you get what you pay for."
2.0,Sloppy seam job right in the middle of the chest. Arrived like the pics show with open seam. I didn’t know I would have to finish sewing it if I want to ever wear it. Length and size are ok.
2.0,Super cute but was pretty expensive for ONE piece of nipple jewelry. I was extremely disappointed that I would have to buy another one to have a set. Don't buy unless you only have one nipple pierced.
2.0,not very well made not the quality i wanted would not buy again
2.0,"Cheap quality, expected more for the price. Super thin material. Printed logo and size on inside back shows through since back is not printed. Would not recommend."
2.0,I like the top snd it’s a great fit and feel but I bought the wine color and now instead of wine and white I have a wine and pink shirt.  I washed it in cold water as per instructions.
2.0,Weird material - shiny and 70's grandma like. Ish.
2.0,Quality is ok but to short for my wrist.
2.0,"I really, really wanted to like this dress but the quality is not worth the money I spent on it"
2.0,Cannot wear these they are too small.
2.0,Customer service was fabulous when the 6-12 didn’t fit my 5-6 month old.  They replaced an already worn pair of NB-6 month socks with 6-12 month socks but the squiddy part rubbed the skin off of my girl! :( they did stay on but my girl can’t wear these again!  Great idea and did work just not for my girl.👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼
2.0,"The top is cheaply made, the strap broke right after taking it out of the bag. Decided to return it and not sew it on myself. Otherwise fit as expected"
2.0,Not user friendly.  It is not easy to take links out to adjust size.  Tool sent with band does not work.  No instructions given.
2.0,Like these glasses and have bought multiple pairs but find over time the rim of the frame on 2 instances have cracked.
2.0,SO unflattering.... awkward looking too!
2.0,"I am 5'8.  These are way too short in the torso.  The material is,a bit like a Halloween costume.  Could be way better because the style is cute."
2.0,I'm a 36b and this for terribly on me
2.0,I don't even know where to start but I'm really really disappointed this is not worth this price and the worst part I purchased 2 for my daughters for award ceremony and now I have to go find them something else to wear not the same as describe doesn't fit at all I'm ju st disappointed
2.0,"These thigh high tights were too tight at the top, making my thighs bulge. Also, the shiny black material they are made from make the tights look more like very long hospital compression tights. I am a 5.1 150lb woman."
2.0,"These booties are too cute.  We had a pair of the sheep before so we wanted another pair.  However, these don't seem to be up to the same quality.<br />#1 these run large.  I had to wait until my son was a size 5/6 to wear them which ended up being when he was 12-15 months old.<br />#2 upon opening, the fabric shedded.<br />#3 after one wear, the fabric stretched and you can see the nylon fabric underneath.<br />Overall, I am disappointed with my purchase."
2.0,"The measurements on the Size Chart are incorrect.  I know the numbers on my measurements, and purchased the size that correlated to my measurements.  When the dress came it was really tight, when it shouldn't have been.  Too bad, because the dress is a great design and was what I was looking for, otherwise.  Just allow for many more inches if you order."
2.0,The charms were cheaply made and broke off as I tried to place them in the crocs. They were pretty and I’m sad about it
2.0,"Very cute, but unfortunately it’s not comfortable… the arch shape caused my ear a lot of soreness… piercing been in place over 2 years & has been changed multiple time…"
2.0,"I ordered the item because the recipient has a springer spaniel. I was sent a pillowcase with a German Shepherd on it instead. The pillowcase is cute but if you order it because you wanted a springer spaniel on it, you may be surprised!"
2.0,"I received my bag today and it doesn’t look like the picture. In the picture it sits longways and looks like an actual bag, what I received looks like a purse and stands tall. It’s cute but not what I was expecting"
2.0,I liked these and thought they fit well.  They are in the case when not being worn.  Today I opened them and one of the arms broke off. $10 .... so can't be mad.
2.0,Broke 1 st time worn
2.0,"Picture doesn’t reflect how deep the v at the neck is.  I’m a size 2, 34C. I had room in the chest to carry a sack of oranges. Just ridiculous. Definitely not something that could be worn at work where this dress was listed."
2.0,"These are a total miss for me.  While they do help prevent slip, they end being so uncomfortable and even painful after several hours.  Worst of all, they totally get tangled in my hair every time I try to take my glasses off (and I mostly wear my hair pulled back).  If I had to clean my glasses in the middle of a work day, it would come at the expense of looking like a hot mess afterwards.  Regret missing the return window."
2.0,The buttons are not spaced correctly. Just not what I expected from looking at pictures. I'm full breasted and it looked more like a moo moo top on me. The material is really cheap looking.
2.0,Made in China small need to medium medium needs a large after that good luck
2.0,It says they are screw on. The part that screws is so small that my granddaughter lost within a day. Fell out.
2.0,"This is beautiful, but I have had it less than 24 hours and it came apart on me. I had to fix it. It was held on badly with what I can only guess is cheap hot glue. I have fixed it since, but will never purchase from this company again."
2.0,"I ordered a medium, it was too small, so ordered a large. It didn't feel any bigger, also too small. I just got tired or ordering and exchanging so I just returned the last. Seems like it could look cute if I could find one to fit."
2.0,"Thought this shirt would be fitted, it wasn't. Loose and bigger than normal."
2.0,A couple of these are worth it. One is way to thin and the bigger more flashy piece I received was missing gems.
2.0,These ran super small - like Asian sizing. Very uncomfortable
2.0,"Color comes as a dark gray instead of black. Fabric is very thin, which would be ok with the right underwear, but it's also really funky around the neck line. The fabric bunches up where it meets the neck and I couldn't get it to lay flat. It's also very unclear which direction the front is since it fits almost exactly the same when trying on both ways."
2.0,"The blouse fits but the sleeves are to narrow,  I was disapointed"
2.0,"As a watch enthusiast and collector, I'll own up to spending far more time than might be sensible scrolling and searching Amazon for bargains or interesting time pieces. It seems regardless of the focus of my searches, brands like OLEVS and OUPINKE (or OPK, TDO and JSDun ) tend to pop up in all the time with any number of representations of their ""luxurious attributes."" I decided to pick up a few samples from the aforementioned brands - which appear to be mushroom varieties from the same manufacturer -  to see for myself how well they hold up to the promotional come-ons.<br /><br />The accompanying photo reflects two watches from this manufacturer's stable: the blue sunburst dial styled OPK and a similarly styled OLEVS model. While the two minimalist watches have modest differences in hand styles, dial markers and different disappointing stainless steel bracelets, in terms of overall look and functionality, they're essentially consecutive slices of white bread. In each instance here, the hands and dotted markers are lumed although the longevity of illumination is less than sufficient.  If anything, the lighter weight OPK (69g) with the beads of rice plated band might be the least adequate of the six or so watches I acquired from this company for comparison purposes. The coated mesh bracelet employs a rattling stamped folding deployant clasp with two button release. For reasons that can only be speculated, this watch (as well as associated models from this concern) are shipped without crown retainers so it's a coin toss whether they'll be received with dead batteries or minimally, batteries that will have an inordinately reduced life span. All the these watches have snap off/on pressure closure stainless steel back case covers that is basically a consistent indicator of low end yet from the half full glass perspective, not much of an issue to replace if you have the appropriate cover replacement gadget.<br /><br />From a cursory glance many of these inexpensive models from each label seem relatively attractive and in numerable instances the only pertinent differences are the logos on the packaging and watch dials. On closer examination - let alone under magnification - most simply fail to pass muster even with consideration of the relatively low price point.  A few do not seem to be horrible and a waste of money at any price point and some potential purchasers may even consider these generally modest overall quality watches a good value. While all of them seem to employ arguably accurate lower end Japanese quartz movements which I suppose is the primary objective, nearly all of the quartz movement models I've acquired with a day/date complication are mired with misalignment issues in the date window. That said, I tend to believe these watches are of comparable quality to a host of popular designer branded watches employing effectively the same quality of materials but carrying substantially inflated retail prices.<br /><br />I cannot speak to how prevalent that deficiency is with the automatics or any of the models with the faux jewel dials and bezels because they are simply too gaudy for me to even have in my possession.Generally, there doesn't seem to be a major amount of differentiation between the OLEVS, OUPINKE, TDO or JSDun watches. No matter which branding you decide on it's probably a good idea just to avoid any of the purported stainless steel bracelets and opt for the arguably decent quality leather bands. While top surfaces of the links on the silver stainless steel bracelets are shiny and glimmering, I haven't found a single instance where the underside was commensurably finished. With the majority, the link end caps look dull not in the manner of a brushed finish but rather as though they were not buffed at all.<br /><br />However, if you do decide to be the intrepid explorer with the stainless steel, the ion plated or coated models seem to be of higher aesthetic quality the polished stainless steel. At least the coating tends to obviate some of the rattling...excluding the beads of rice models. Just don't go there at all. Similarly the black or antiqued gold tone cases are a less off-putting choice than the yellow gold tone or the silver cases which tend to appear plated substitutions for the actual metals or minerals.  The stainless steel cases might be a tolerable choice so long as it is not paired with one of the mediocre polished stainless steel bracelets where the end result is a watch that just shimmers CHEAP."
2.0,Granddaughter lost 1 the first day wore them the back came off to easy
2.0,"It got the job done for most of the night as part of my Halloween costume, but pretty crappy quality. Broke after falling on the ground at the end of the night. Not worth the price"
2.0,"Looks nice . Very heavy, what  I don't like."
2.0,I only received 144 piece set.  The item was supposed to be 288 pieces.
2.0,Too large for my thin sarm
2.0,I can’t say anything good about this Bc I haven’t used it in my piercing it is too short the stem of the piercing is not long enough idk who the hell has skin that thin on their navel piercing but I was really excited to use this one and can’t 😩
2.0,Dress fit almost perfectly. The middle band had no stretch to it like the rest of the dress so made it hang weord. The lines on the chest made me look saggy.
2.0,"I expected this to be a formed bookbag. It arrived folded like a poncho. Similar material too. While it will function ok, the flimsy material and no support was not what I was looking for and certainly not worth the price paid."
2.0,Feels heavy and is big for where I got it to wear
2.0,The watch came with no directions on how to program the date and time.
2.0,"I loved this outfit but the fabric is thin and seemingly cheap. Also, the sizing is much smaller than expected."
2.0,Cute but way too short for someone who is 5’ 7”
2.0,"I disagree with others, this does look cheap. But it is cheap so I guess you can't eliminate it on that basis. It was also too small and fell apart in one wear. 👎🏾"
2.0,Very cheap- they will work for night driving
2.0,Foggy
2.0,"I've grown to a DD since nursing and this bra was huge on me. I don't understand why they combine sizes because it's either going to fit perfectly if you are on the high end of the size or be huge if you are on the low end. I don't know how I'd be a BC. I really like the look of it in the pictures, but it just does not fit the way it looks like it should."
2.0,"I had high hopes for this. I am typically a M/L and went with the M based on reviews. It was very sheer fabric. I expected see-through on the holes, but not as much sheerness on the dress itself. I bought the white color, so others may not be as bad. It was way short for my taste (Upper mid thigh). For reference I am 5' 4"", 145 lbs. I have a bit of a tummy and love handles and this dress accentuated both of those and was not flattering. Will be returning."
2.0,Material is  thin and cheap and not thick and comfy like a sweatshirt/Hoodia should be!!
2.0,"Reviews said it ran small so I ordered a size up and it's a joke if they think this is accurate sizing. I'm keeping the pants as lounge pants because they are comfy but whatever you buy, get two sizes from what you originally were gonna go woth"
2.0,When I ordered these they asked what size and I put medium and when they came they are one size fits all.  They are extremely tight so I will be giving them to my daughter and going back to regular mock turtlenecks.
2.0,"The dress is really cute, but unfortunately it started falling apart after the first time I washed it. And, yes, I followed the washing instructions on the label. :("
2.0,was happy with the size and pattern but the strap broke after 3 days of relatively light use.
2.0,"Fabric is thin, stitching is poor (thread breaks with minor stretching). While this does have pockets, they are awkward - why do you need a pocket UNDER your skirt?"
2.0,Graddaugter only wore it one day before the chain broke.
2.0,"cheap, and ugly price says it all and took over a month to get it"
2.0,The top on this dress is too loose. Have to wear something under it so my chest isn't showing which ruins the look of it. It's also very thing so you need a slip or something too. Not what I expected it all.
2.0,"The buttons don’t hold the shirt closed.  I’d you have a small waist/flat belly, it may fit better."
2.0,"The size chart is way off. Chest size is much bigger than the chart. Shirt is also way too short. This shirt is for short people. Advertised wrong right from their page. Also looks to be returned before me, being in a shipping bag with an LPN sticker. The sleeves are nice though, very stretchy too."
2.0,Material terrible
2.0,One side was upper one side was down. Curves are asymmetrical.
2.0,Fell apart before I could even try them on
2.0,"Looks great in pictures and when you receive it,  bit the screws is too small and very frail."
2.0,"The skirt design is just what I was looking for. However the corduroy fabric is a little thin (lightweight). I used Static Guard, as it was sticking to my legs. Wore it for the day and I looked really cute in it with a black mock turtleneck and rust-colored lace skinny scarf. Washed it the next day on cold, gentle cycle and the side seam is completely ripped open. I now have to sew this shut. It does not seem to be of good quality construction and I'm aggravated that I now have to fix a garment item that I've only worn once."
2.0,Fabric not for my liking. I did not catch that it is Dry Clean Only.  For a tee shirt
2.0,I like it and it broke today after five weeks of wear.  Trying to fix the break.<br /><br />The band wears very nicely and looks very clean and handsome.
2.0,I really like the look and style of these but they turned my ears green and caused so much pain they caused my lobes to rip. Plugs should be able to be left in without turning your ears green and irritating you. This is the first pair this has happened with.
2.0,Buttons on it are trash I lost the original one while riding and bought a second bc I liked it so much. Now the second one came loose and flew off while I was driving with the windows down.
2.0,"Very beautiful  but too fragile. The back broke the second time I wore them and I am very careful with my jewelry, so you know."
2.0,The quality matches the price
2.0,"Fit a bit more loosely than I anticipated. Also, when I opened the packaging it smelled like cigarette and marijuana smoke. ??"
2.0,"No....just nooooooo! I don't know what body type they THINK an XL is for...but it's a bunch of material in the front, but the sleeves/shoulders are stoooopid tight. I mean you'd have to have a HUGE chest and iddy bitty shoulders??? Can we say unrealistic Barbie measurements???"
2.0,Material is rough in texture and very scratchy on the skin.
2.0,"Loved it the first day, the next day I went to put it on and one of the magnets had fallen out :( completely heart broken"
2.0,I returned this item because the Velcro on the side of strap would rub against my ankle.
2.0,Not what Expected cute but I can't where it where I intended
2.0,Very pretty but two of the sets came apart the first time I wore them.
2.0,"I purchased these to hold mu business cards. Was disappointed to find out that the card is not held under a plastic cover and that the tag only has a thin rim to retain the cards. As expected, after my first trip the cards were starting to slip out."
2.0,Beautifully made pants but too small. Wish they made them larger for my dad.
2.0,The color n style I like just wish it was bigger
2.0,It's so beautiful but to BIG. There is absolutely no way to use this anywhere in your cartilage. The lobe is the only place this would work and that's not how this is described.
2.0,nice hat but took over a week longer to receive it than the black one...and even though it appears when ordering that they are both coming from same place...Not happening...I think this one came from China and the Black on was more local packaging.  Both are Wool and not as described...but OK for what I need them for
2.0,I have 2 other pair and LOVE them. They are very heavy but suler cute. I wanted orange and the package says orange but they definitely are not like the photo. It looks more like a coral pink....i was really sad.
2.0,"Loved these shoes but they run very small. Also BOTH sets I received had one shoe that did not light up. I exchanged the first set for a bigger size as they run small and the lights didn't work, my second set fit my son but only one shoe lit up.. I wasn't going to mail them back for a second time so I just kept them. They also fit pretty narrow."
2.0,It didn’t come smooth. The face of the circle had little lines going through it as shown in the picture. I think this makes it look cheaper. I haven’t had it long and the clasp is already turned.
2.0,The waist hits me more like an empire waist which I don’t particularly care for.
2.0,Good fit good quality so surprised
2.0,I dont know why this is called a floppy hat when it is so stiff. Outter brim has metal and hat is extremely stiff and only moves when it is purposely fixed. Gave it to my mother to garden since I was not satisfied at all
2.0,"Definitely size up if you do get this. I’m usually a medium and got a large and it fits great. The top isn’t a sports bra. Zero support. It’s more of a shirt, so your nipples will show. I got the darkish red and the color was closer to a cherry red. The material is on the thin side; it’s not quite made for sweating or lounging. Kind of an odd material honestly. If I wouldn’t have gotten this for $12, I would have returned it."
2.0,"Very flimsy fabric, not a keeper."
2.0,It doesn't fit well.  Fits nothing like what's seen on the model.
2.0,The short is ok but the blouse you can see right through ...it is extreeeemmmly thin!
2.0,These are the best socks ever! The leg and ankle swelling I'd get at the end of the day is gone.  I'd recommended them to anyone who stand or sit for long periods at a time!
2.0,The product is very cute and breathable material.  My only complaint is it runs very small.  It is too small for my 6 year old for which it was intended.
2.0,The material was thinner than expected.
2.0,"I was looking forward to wearing this dress at my baby shower, got a small ( fit was great but the zipper wouldn’t stay zipped, so got a medium think yes it would fit perfectly... NO! It was honestly smaller than the small... I couldn’t even get the zipper to zip at all . Returned it to get a large thinking that it has too work.... NO same problem couldn’t get zipper to zip and very tight around waste! The color was perfect and still don’t understand why I could fit into a small but not a large? So maybe not the best for a growing belly! But it was very sexy and cute wish it would have worked for me !"
2.0,Runs super small and complicated to put on.
2.0,I wasn't expecting a pouch in the front my fault for not noticing it in the pic on product page. Very thin silk...too thin. I want a nice tight fit for my package. Gonna give to clothing donation.
2.0,runs very small and the fabric is thin and shiny and not very good quality! I havent wore it since I bought it cause is super small
2.0,Don’t stay attached to my fit bit :(
2.0,These were to small for my husband's hands.
2.0,"This dress was adorable...until I actually tried it on. I'm a true large so the fit was fine, but the girls are a large C. The solid panels? Will not cover them. Period. It looks pretty ridiculous. Just food for thought!"
2.0,"Looks ok but not a great quality. Very, very thin"
2.0,"Runs small, wasn’t flattering, and the material was cheap."
2.0,"Took way too long to get this, and fit is too tight."
2.0,"This costume was very cute. However, I wish I had opened it prior to the night before our Halloween party. The white shirt had 3 stains on it. Thankfully I was able to hide them enough so they weren’t awfully noticeable. Not really what you want to happen when you spend $60 on something."
2.0,"Matte nude, size 9. These were wrapped in a plastic bag and smelled terrible when I took them out. They are not comfy. I bought the same shoes in the green suede which are so comfortable (The negative to those is that the green tie string doesn’t match the shoe so I will have to search for some thing that does). Anyway if this color came in the suede version they would be so much better."
2.0,Huge!!!  Balls are big and the braided leather material is really big.  Wasn’t looking for a “statement piece” just a cute small torquise bracelet.  Was going to return but may give as a gift
2.0,Too narrow. Size 11 normal but should have ordered the 11.5
2.0,The fit is small And they look NOTHING like the pics. Very unhappy.
2.0,"Stones don't have much sparkle, rose gold is very pale"
2.0,"Well the slippers themselves would rate at about a 3 but the seller charging a restocking fee when their item was sub par, lost them another star."
2.0,I love this caftan but it has a very strong chemical odor. I’ve washed it twice as directed with no luck
2.0,Cheap quality and feel
2.0,It's cute but way too small. I gave it to my niece! Looks cute on her.
2.0,"La calidad no es muy buena, precio-calidad puedes encontrar algo mejor."
2.0,"Everyone said order up, so I did and the shoulders are wide and the sleeves are loose. However, if I didn't order up, I think it would be too short. The front is much longer than the back. This cardigan wouldn't work if you were trying to cover your backside while wearing leggings since it is too short. The material is flimsy. It's okay but I don't love it but I'm too lazy to return it at this point. I'll try to wear it a few times. I'm a little afraid to wash it, it looks like it might fall apart."
2.0,Way too small! Order a size up.
2.0,"The watch arrived with a dead battery, which wasn't a huge deal until it appeared that the case cover couldn't be easily removed to replace the battery without damaging the wood.  I then noticed that the crystal was plastic, which was a no go for me, and ended up sending it back for a refund. The vendor was responsive and quickly processed the refund."
2.0,I bought the green and the fabric reminded me of a dish towel.  Hated it. Had to return
2.0,Very upset! I ordered the light purple and i received the pink one.. the color is nothing like the picture..
2.0,Unflatteringly compresses boobs.
2.0,"I am unable to notice any compression on these at all. As far as running socks they are just ok, nothing special. So far my favorite running socks are feetures"
2.0,Ordered large size- Fits more like a small/medium not at all large! Beautiful lightweight fabric!
2.0,"I bought the navy blue dress with polka dots in size small. I'm 5'0 and weight 100pounds. The dress is pretty. But it was too long, the sleeves a little big, and from the waist down it's not very flowy, like the gray/blue one."
2.0,It fits well and good material but very disappointed that 1 shirt has a rip and a hole on it.
2.0,"Very cute shirt.. However, the material is like a pajama shirt. I ordered the 2t size and it was huge! So big my 10 year old niece could wear it. I just gave it to her..."
2.0,"The ladies mask is lovely, but the men's mask came in broken in pieces.  It's more to ship it back then its worth.  But again the ladies mask is lovely"
2.0,Was surprised to see a dif color other than the picture. Was really cute tho!
2.0,With the &#34;retail&#34; cost of over $100 I thought it would be nicer.  Looks cheap to me next to my other beads.  Cannot use it.  Get what you pay for I guess.
2.0,"I need these stockings for varicose veins but they keep sliding down my leg.  Want to return these, but there is no UPS store to bring them to without a mailing label.  I do not understand why I can't have a mailing label from Amazon so I don't have to pay for shipping.  Very unhappy with Amazon."
2.0,size is ok but material is very bad and that makes it look cheap when in the picture looks high class
2.0,It bigger than the size and poor quality.
2.0,"Would be cute but it is way too small. I am 5'6&#34; 145 lbs. I normally wear a med/large so I ordered a large at first, ended up ordering a XXL later and it still didn't fit! The torso is way too short. The metal embellishment at the top of the breast cup where the red is didn't even come up to my breasts, both suits were like this. It's a shame because it would have been cute had it been long enough."
2.0,Quality super thin. Fabric got rough with within a few times of wear. The drawstring is super cheap. Sizing is off for the boys. Way to big my kid is a medium and the small is even to big. Should have ordered an xsmall.
2.0,My daughter absolutely loves it. Was worried about picture cracking or peeling when washed but that didn't happen.<br /><br />Change rating because with second wash...it did crack and peel....very disappointing....my daughter is very sad.
2.0,"I like the watch, but it fell apart. Pins came out & I cannot find them. Very disappointed!"
2.0,"I honestly hate to give anything only two stars, but this was not what I expected. Actually, I originally gave this only one star but bumped it up because I realize I could have made a judgment without knowing what would look good on me well enough. That said, this had problems for me. It came too large (again, I admittedly might have accidentally ordered two sizes too big, but I'm a medium and I got an XL). But it looked like a tent on me because it was too large. Yet, even if it was not too large, I don't think this would have been particularly flattering. The buttons were cheap looking, the material was too stretchy to give a nice fit, and the cut was off, so it didn't hang right on the neck. Again, all of these issues could be because it came in too big a size or it was just not the cut/shirt for me, but I returned it for a refund, because I was not even interested in a replacement size."
2.0,Do not but in dryer shrinks to tight to get over head and get your arms in
2.0,"Sleeves are really short. Runs small. I wear an XL, it is small for an XL."
2.0,I returned these because I the colors don’t match the photos and weren’t very pretty.
2.0,"It would be beautiful but the proportions are WAY off. I ordered an XXL which would have fit for the sheer part, but the sleeves were so tight I could barely try it on. The lining inside was so short it didnt even cover my bits. Returned immediately."
2.0,It says 24 months - 4 years but it was really small. We have other bow ties from other places same size range and are larger. It did not work and is being returned.
2.0,way too tight around the bust area but it looked cute but not on me cuz it wouldn't fit over my chest
2.0,The product is very nice<br />But it came with a printing defect<br />The only option we have to solve it is a replacement or refund<br />  We tried to replace it but it did not give us because the inventory in the same size is out of stock<br />  In the end we decide to keep it because my daughter like it
2.0,"Great comfort. Not sure why my bottom fell off of one, but I would buy from this company again."
2.0,The fabric was too thin !!! Can see right they it!!!
2.0,"Unique watch band has a flat surface as opposed to the foam padded bands is quality one piece construction. The band was supposed to be brown, it is actually red and it is darker than pictured. A thin application of black liquid staining material (looks like liquid black shoe polish) was placed over the red leather which you can see through when you bend the strap.<br /><br />The watch band is rather unique in that it has a series of side holes punched in the upper band for breathability and helps save the band in hot weather when you are sweating, helps moisture escape, I have seen this on steering wheel covers, I am wondering if this is a retread of another product. I haven't seen this in a watch wrist band before. The watch band is midrange at $17.00 at the time of this review. The weird coloring and black stain make the band unattractive and unwearable."
2.0,It was very shiny and pretty but the clasp did not close from the second wear on. Waste of money in the end  Also the hoop is huge and took up most of my face.
2.0,"I have used this product as a purse.  I like it because there is a place for all the things I like to have with me.<br />I was not so pleased because I had thought I ordered a black purse, and it turned out to be blue.  However, i can live with that."
2.0,Ordered in August and the sole is split by Thanks Giving.
2.0,it was large and baggy but it was see through in the bottom portion and too short simultaneously.  I'm 5'5&#34; and usually wear a small so I was surprised that it was too short but also huge.  I would suggest maybe they make it more form fitting instead of using a drawstring to sloppily cinch it in.
2.0,Another reviewer commented that it hits too short and it's true. Its definitely not a tunic sweatshirt and not true to size. Runs a bit small.
2.0,"This shirt was not flattering. The cinch accentuated my stomach, and it didn’t look good."
2.0,"For the price, it's fine.  It's not more than or less than.  If you're expecting a fine-quality waistcoat, keep looking.  If you're looking for something interesting on a lark, to wear now and again, with jeans, order away."
2.0,"The dress is nice, but the seam goes right down the middle of the breast in a weird way.  It also smelled terrible like animals and smoke. Makes me really question if this is a fake."
2.0,It's a cute scarf but so short it's not really practical and doesn't look nice on.
2.0,I'm a small short person. This dress was too short and too tight. Def would not wear it to work. Cute though
2.0,"What a cheaply made garment. The pattern on the dress is upside down, so all of the birds and butterflies are facing downward. No attention to detail whatsoever. You get what you pay for, I guess. Anyway, it's going back. I'm not ordering clothing from Amazon anymore; there's no quality control and I'm constantly ending up with these ill-fitting dresses."
2.0,They fit great and feel nice but you can definitely see your butt when you turn around and look in the mirror.
2.0,I was expecting this to have a little more shape to this based on the picture but was pretty plan not much structure with the cut of it.  Will be returning this one.
2.0,I didn’t like the fact that this dress is too tight on chest area and if you want to go out wearing this dress on a windy day. You’ll be up for a M.Monroe show!
2.0,"It's cute, but I ordered 2 sizes up, and it's a struggle to zip over the bust"
2.0,Material felt cheap and didn't hold up. Soles are hard and clunky.
2.0,Well they aren't sweat proof
2.0,"Runs very small , and makes you chest look very peculiar. Coned boob cups 👎🏻"
2.0,"Beautiful, but too heavy."
2.0,This was just messy looking. Like a mistake had been made
2.0,The size chart for this dress is way off. I ordered a size up and was still too tight. Quality is very low. Even before trying on the supper is very fragile and seems it will break at any time. Returning today for a different style.
2.0,"I followed the guidelines for sizing. It arrived quickly and was pretty coming out of the packaging. However, when I put it on it was cheaply made and far too small. In fact, it tore along the seam. I don’t know what to do with it."
2.0,I chose this rating because the headband is just a strip of sparkle paper basically. It doesn't stay on my head at all. I wouldn't recommend this product to anyone really because it slips off just walking around.
2.0,"I thought the shirt said rayon & spandex. I got the coffee/red plaid. But it is 35 cotton/65 poly/5 spandex. The top plaid part feels and looks flimsy cheap. I thought product description also said “machine washable” but this says dry clean recommended. If it wasn’t for the top plaid part not feeling or being as sturdy as I expected, I wouldn’t be returning. I do however, love the bottom half/coffee part."
2.0,Medium wasn't a medium... it was too big.  I don't think it's difficult to have a standard size so we get what we want.
2.0,I liked the product but the zipper broke within two months. Didn’t know how to return but now that I do my window is closed.
2.0,Very cute and well made items. But they're sized to fit adults not childrens.
2.0,The Buckle is too Small.
2.0,This skirt was way too big for me. I am 5'2 110 lbs. I bought a small. It was huge around the waist and too long.
2.0,I bought this a few weeks ago and just this weekend it's cold enough to actually wear it.  It fits as expected and looked great.  I would have given it 5 stars EXCEPT that it is falling apart already after 1 wear.  I washed it yesterday; in the gentle cycle with a small load.  I laid it flat to dry and notice in the picture how the seams are already falling apart.  I expected better.
2.0,"Very nice, but way too small"
2.0,Very hard to wear it It’s very tight thanks
2.0,Pretty ring but the little stones fall out easily and discolor.
2.0,They’re very pretty but do not stay put. Have to keep adjusting them.
2.0,I wear a 40C and ordered XL. The cups are way too small. Disappointed.
2.0,Don't expect these to compare to kenkoh's.
2.0,"Maybe i am using it with too small a camera, but on My Sony RX1R it just feels too bulky.<br /><br />But if you were using it on a much bigger camera you probably do not want a 2 lbs DSLR dangling on tour wrist.<br /><br />I missed the return window, so somebody is going to to receive it as a gift."
2.0,"It's a nice romper but very very short,  I bought a large and my butt cheeks were smiling outdoors....good for the club r pool party but let me repeat it's very very short, not a good buy for persons who don't like revealing much, makes a perfect bodysuit if you get what I mean....."
2.0,The logo is coming off on one wash didnt even put in dryer.
2.0,"I was excited about ordering these rings, since they are more unique than most other women's silicone rings. However, there is a very obvious seam/ridge in the middle from the silicone mold, which totally ruins the look. It is on all the rings I received.  If that were fixed, I would be completely happy them, as they are very comfortable and the colors are true to the photos."
2.0,They are ok but very expensive. I will just go with prescription glasses from now on.
2.0,Would def work for no panty lines. As for the use to conceal &#34;camel toe&#34; it's too thin and doesn't work for this use.
2.0,I love this hoodie but the lace tears very easily (hand wash it!) and there was a cut in the lace pocket when I received it.
2.0,The picture shows a much plusher mane. It barely shows above straight hair. Pretty disappointing to my kid for his costume.
2.0,Too huge for a woman's face.
2.0,"I purchased this jacket because of a coupon code. I got what I paid for. It feels as cheap and thin, is sized small, and the zippers are scratchy."
2.0,Looks and feels cheap. The band is not real leather and cracked on the inside of the band within a month of using it. It isn't a good quality band. Don't waste your money. You will just have to replace it in about 2 months time!
2.0,Pretty thin and lacks quality.  sorry
2.0,These are sheer like I wanted for my daughter.<br />But don't expect them to last.<br />They snag super easily
2.0,The case is ok. Does not fit well is 3party glass covers. Touching the edges or trying to use the pull down was difficult with the front screen cover. I cracked the case once I dropped it. The phone was fine but happen only after dropping once. Would not buy again.
2.0,"I was extremely disappointed with this purchase. I honestly don't think the model in the listing photos is wearing the same dress I received because the one I got did not seem to be designed to fit a woman shaped like ... well, a human woman.<br /><br />First, the good news. The fabric is reasonably soft. Not super, snuggly soft like some other dress fabrics out there, but not rough and scratchy either.<br /><br />The gray color I ordered was a little lighter than I expected, but I know colors look different on different monitors, so I was fine with that.<br /><br />I ordered an XXL because I felt this size would most accurately accommodate my measurements based on the dimensions in the size chart. I am 5'6"" and 160 lbs. so I am carrying a little extra weight around, but not an excessive amount. I wanted to make sure the smallest measurement in the size chart (the waist) would still fit me, so I went with the XXL, even though the bust dimensions looked like they might be a little big.<br /><br />The size chart was correct. The waist was sized about right for my body. It could have been a little more snug and still been comfortable, but not a whole lot.<br /><br />The bust dimensions were definitely big. Way way way too big. The bodice gaped in front and the edges of the neckline were on my shoulders, so both bra straps would have been completely visible if it had not been for the strap ties.<br /><br />With the strap ties crossing my bust, the bra straps were hidden away, but the neckline in front was still too loose.<br /><br />But here's the weird part. The ties were too short to tie in back as shown in the picture. They tied okay in the front, although much higher than the waistline (again, as shown in the picture). The knot ended up right under my bust, leaving an awkward gap between the tie and the waistline. And there was definitely no way to tie them behind my back. They barely touched each other.<br /><br />Had the only issue been the gaping neckline, I would have exchanged the dress for an XL. But I figured if the ties on the 2X were too short, the ties on the 1X weren't going to be any better!  I decided to return the dress instead."
2.0,The silver is pretty but the Ruby is not real..it looks cloudy so it looks to obvious that it is fake. But I love the design.
2.0,Not not shorts rather hipsters and they're a bit large And Olsen as the day goes on. Not the best but they do the job
2.0,"Very nice bracelet, just what I was looking for.  The only thing I don't like very much is that it's not silver color, it is more opaque, but still nice.<br /><br />Update: so far 3 crystals have fallen... I imagine that in another month there will be none."
2.0,"The picture makes it look girly but sophisticated, however it looked more babyish and cutesy in real life. The bottom didn't drape that nicely and it was a little short. I'm normally an XS or S, I got a M. It was the right size but it looked all puffy and weird. I think i'ts good in theory but unless you're 80lbs and 5'0, skip this top."
2.0,"Smaller than expected... the picture makes the hammer part look big but in reality the mjolnir hammer on this ring is small...<br />i ordered a size 10 and it barely fits me. Very tight fit compared to all of my other rings that are size 10.<br />And it is much lighter than expected, i thought it was going to be heavier than it is, this ring is very light, almost nothing to it.<br />For the price i paid for this ring i am very disappointed in the fit and finish of this ring, definitely not worth the money spent or the time waiting for it to arrive...."
2.0,"So the costume itself looks ok but I can’t review it yet because it’s wet?! It came in a box with two other items I ordered, they were fine, the box was dry, everything in the box was dry, the costume was in a really nice thick ziplock style bag, but the costume inside the bag was soaked and smells like a load of laundry that’s been forgotten in the washer for a couple of days. Pretty gross, super confusing, guess we’ll see how it holds up in the wash."
2.0,The boots have a strong smell. I have left them sit out since I got them weeks ago. Not sure I will be able to stand the smell if or when I ever wear them?<br />Maybe they are treated with something or leather protection or suede but I have many pair of Franco Sarto boots that do not smell toxic.
2.0,I ordered the camo and I would say this run tts to slightly large. The fit is awkward though.  I matter what I did the straps were uneven. I had to return.
2.0,"These are mid- grade quality. They are not my favorite pair, they're in my cycle of clothing as back ups...like laundry day."
2.0,Didn’t care for the material and they ran small
2.0,Thin material & runs too small
2.0,The bag ripped after a few uses.
2.0,I wear a 10 or 12 and ordered the XXL based on the reviews I read and this was too small for me.  I will need to return it.  The material is also so think that I don't see how this could be worn for anything other than a beach/pool cover up.
2.0,They are suppose to be for very cold weather.  I found that they did not keep my hands warm at all.  The temp was 39 on the ski slope.  My hands were freezing
2.0,"Is this real Coach? Gold metallic pieces fell off. One fell off first week. The other fell off a month later. Didn't want to deal with hassle of return, so I super glued."
2.0,I found the socks uncomfortable inside my shoes because they are too long and wide in the toes.
2.0,"I washed this dress in cold water and hung to dry and I would say that it shrunk about 3” in width and now it doesn’t fit.  So sad, such a cute dress."
2.0,It fit well but the material is probably meant to be worn in the summer or spring. It is really thin
2.0,"The rings were so thick that my other fingers were uncomfortably pushed apart by it. The gold one tarnished within the first day of having it. When the ring is on your finger, it doesn’t stay closed so the edges rub against your finger."
2.0,"They are so cute.  My grandsons loved them, but they are a little hard to attach to their collars. They tend to pick other ties instead of this on because it is difficult."
2.0,"I was expecting a chain or similar as shown in the photo, not leather."
2.0,I got this for my daughters birthday and it was way too small. It was very upsetting!!!!
2.0,The band part with buckle did NOT have the part you needed to slide it in to your watch. I emailed the Co. the band and I got NO response. I would NOT recommend you buy from that company
2.0,"I’ve had my ears pierced for over 20 years and have worn many different styles of earrings, however these are hard to push through and make my ears sore to the point that I have to remove them. Too bad because they are cute."
2.0,Fabric was cheap & joggers were not well made
2.0,i loved this but it was too exact. it was slightly tight around the arms. I would suggest you size up one size for a more comfortable fit. it was short in length so it rolled up easily
2.0,Cheap and skimpy but like shown
2.0,I ended up returning this set since it was too white looking [[ASIN:B011X09Q5U Mariell Multi-Shaped Pear and Marquise Cubic Zirconia Necklace Earring Set on Delicate Chain - Top Seller]]and i preferred the more natural silver look. I ended up keeping this version: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B011X09Q5U/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o04_s01?ie=UTF8&psc=1
2.0,I didn’t love these bands like I thought I would. I ordered two. Snagged it a couple times the first day and the loops pull out. Plastic under the slide pokes my wrist. The silicone oem band is much more comfortable.
2.0,The connection to charge broke after the first week.  Very disappointed.
2.0,I bought the largest size and it was way too small. I fell like I got ripped off.  The suit was ok though
2.0,This is a really cute blouse if only the lace didn't fall apart after one wash. And it is made with some sort of elastic so there are little pieces of elastic string all over the place. No washing instructions so I washed on delicate and hung dry.
2.0,Material is really sad. Fit is kind of frumpy because of it.
2.0,Not true to size way too big
2.0,These pants are really small. They say standard size on the label (  I dont. Know what that is supposed to mean.) Made in Thailand. They most certainly do not fit anyone larger than a medium and I would venture to say they would  onlybfit a woman who is a size small and look the same way advertised.  I am very disappointed.  I was looking so forward to getting them and now have to just give them away.  2 stars because I do like look and feel of fabric.
2.0,"It broke very quickly,  but that was to be expected for the price. Great if you're into just wearing something a couple times before throwing it away."
2.0,"I have had it for 2 days and it is still in good shape. I don't have the highest hopes for it because it is VERY cheap material. It's very cute and I have gotten compliments on it already, but next time I will definitely read the reviews before purchasing. I don't think it'll be lasting very long."
2.0,It's cute.  I was looking for something a little more substantial.  Pockets are small and it's not very heavy duty.
2.0,These are smaller and less bright than I expected. Not impressed
2.0,Very cute but I followed advice from other reviews and ordered bigger and it was still way too small. Couldn't get the pants over my thighs and I'm by no means a big girl.
2.0,"WAY to small, size is inaccurate and therefore this item was returned. Very bummed because I was super excited about it."
2.0,"Its cute,  however,  the snap has already broken.  And I am not sending it back to China."
2.0,The quality of it was also a little cheap.
2.0,Much smaller and shorter than their size chart.
2.0,Fit was too lose and the colors were not as vibrant as I thought. If your a bigger person may fit better
2.0,I still look bloated and fat. Just smoother<br /> That's all.
2.0,"Ring was much much smaller than picture made it seem. Decent for the price, I suppose. I wouldn't have paid more than half price if I knew how small the ring was though."
2.0,The quality of the shirt was great and it was super cute! But it is not true to size.
2.0,"We bought this for my daughters 3rd birthday. It's been great for about 5 months. All of a sudden the colorful led lights are not working. This is something up out of her reach. It is a product malfunction of some sort. I am also emailing the seller in hopes of remedying the situation.<br />Otherwise, its great bedtime light. We love it."
2.0,"itchy and tight arms, baggy and plastic-y shirt"
2.0,"The pattern and colors on the skirt are great, but the skirt does not flow like it seems in the picture. The material is really stiff and feels more like a wind breaker. It's also a little too small, so the slit is uncomfortably placed."
2.0,"The tie that goes around the neck is very large, almost like it's been stretched out. The tail is very small just fyi. It's like a mini cat tail. And the head band you could still see some glue by the ears."
2.0,Cheapened in a later version and crushed in shipping.
2.0,"The fabric and quality were both great, especially for the price. However, the problem was that the right sleeve was incorrectly sewn and this made it pull when I moved my arm. I'm wondering now if that was the problem written in other reviews when they said the sleeves run small. The rest of the fit was pretty true to size and well done. I had to return because the pull and the appearance of the pull were not acceptable."
2.0,Don't feel like real silk. More like Nylon. Pilling after 3 wears.
2.0,"It's cute and good material, but fits me like an XL and I ordered a small. I'm a 34 A and the top and bottom was extremely too big"
2.0,"I love the way these boots look, but after wearing them only three times I’ve noticed they are coming apart."
2.0,Very very small can't even Twist on
2.0,I returned it - defective styling - waist too high -
2.0,Top was too short
2.0,"to small for me, gave to very little ladies"
2.0,Order up at least 1 size. Made to small. Returned!
2.0,"I own several vests, all the same size M.  Appreciating the length for a sports vests, it is a beautiful light grey thin fleece. This one not only fits large in the bust, the collar fits like a men’s vest and untaylored.  The front and back materials of collar are uneven creating uneven, awkward twisted ripples.  I’m keeping for an under jacket liner."
2.0,"The socks are non-skid as it says, but they move on your feet so that I have to keep adjusting them as I do my yoga."
2.0,My chain got caught on a tiny link of a fence and snapped like a twig the day after it arrived. This completely ruined my experience as a buyer because I did not expect such terribly weak merchandise
2.0,I did not find this mask comfortable or very breathable- I should of paid attention to the fabric content.  It’s really cute to wear for a few minutes but not all day.
2.0,Beautiful watch. It worked for 1.5 months. Then it stopped. I would expect a product to last longer even if it is a battery issue. Very disappointed.
2.0,"Just too difficult to put on, especially compared to my Sockwell socks.<br />I purchased L/XL in both and couldn't get the SB SOX on my size 13 feet (which are not very wide or thick)."
2.0,Poor quality. Did not like the fabric. Ended up returning it.
2.0,"Fraudulent claims of NEW. When I recieved these SUNglasses:<br />1. They arrived in an EYEglass case. 2. There was a fingerprint on the inside of one lens. 3.The soft sided pouch was not included in my package. 4. The arms are uneven. 5. The package did not contain any kind of seal.<br />These are refurbished or used, but NOT NEW."
2.0,Too short for long torso
2.0,the pants are too tight at the waist would be great with more give in elastic. trying to decide if I will keep them.
2.0,It's not as highly polished as the pictures they provide... Mine just kind of looks dirty.  The inside looks grinded down unreadible at diff points.  I don't know if it is the way it is made or what but it fits much looser then all my other size 15 rings... Afraid to even where it. Was more then a little disappointed.
2.0,looks like a south African made uniform.
2.0,I like the fabric but the front bottom of the cardigan is absolutely uneven!!! Front left side is about 4 inches longer than the right side. And it looks very awkward.
2.0,[[VIDEOID:4f8e57c5a0c41dd613da35c03ee2d8be]] Definitely not the color advertised. Seriously disappointed because I was looking forward to this deep orange color shown
2.0,Very thin material. The pink crosses are only on the front of right leg. The pink also seems to be an iron on pattern.<br />I was disappointed as the appearance of the leggings leads you to believe that the pink wraps around the whole leg
2.0,cheap material don't like the viable  stitching but usable
2.0,Meh! Didn't like the material! Looking for a nice smooth feeling leggings this wasn't it
2.0,NOT AS GOOD AS THE PICTURE
2.0,"Thought the watch band looked really nice.  Read the reviews and was kind of worried about ordering.  Got the band, tried it on, it immediately fell off.  Thought, maybe I didnt clip it in the watch completely.  Tried again, same thing.  I noticed the latch on the band had no tension.  Took the clip apart and found there were no springs to hold the latch out.  Had yo take my old band apart and use pieces so the new band would work.  Not impressed at all.  Also. Had a friend, same thing. So, if you order this, make sure you keep your old bands just for extra parts.  It does look nice however."
2.0,"Do not expect them to be circular. Mine came more with horn rimmed edges. Also, the &#34;leopard&#34; option depicts solid Brown coloring, but they were very much leopard patterned."
2.0,"I wish this dress fit me like the photos advertised<br /><br />The label is marked XS on the dress but I would say it’s more like an American small which is more like a Euro medium. Sadly swimming in it. Sleeves are not fitted, waist is many inches too large and weirdly enough the armpits are low- beautiful dress otherwise/ perfect for someone bigger than me.<br /><br />For reference I’m 5’6, 119 lbs, 32C."
2.0,Returned. Way to small if you're a medium do not order a s/m!
2.0,The skirt is not the skirt pictured.  The waist is not a high waist as shown.  The waist is a lot thinner and doesn't lay down.  It makes it hard to tuck a shirt in without bulging.  Fabric is nice.  The fit is accurate.  It would have been a nice skirt with the wide waist
2.0,My little grandson picked this out for Christmas. It’s so thin and the material is not that great. It will probably last till spring and hopefully he will be into something else by then
2.0,Didn't like and ended up returning it.
2.0,"I wear a US M-L, so I ordered this shirt in 2X.  The 2X fits like a US S- Small. It’s a cute shirt, so I’ll squeeze into it. Thin, transparent material."
2.0,Cheap material compared to last years suit!
2.0,"Calling it a sweatshirt is generous — I knew it was sus when the package was mad flat. I’d say this is slightly thicker than a typical long sleeved shirt. The pic is deceiving. Color is definitely more beige than apricot (not sure why they went with that description), and the drawstring seems a bit flimsy. I’ll be returning!"
2.0,"The color is the number one disappointment because is not at all like the one advertised. The one that the model is wearing is such a bold, darker, strong blue and this one is definitely not it! The one I got is more like a bright ocean blue.<br />The material that the blouse is made of is cheap but for the price is fine.<br />It fits as expected. I’m very tall and it does not show the belly at all which is always one of my concerns when buying stuff online (too short vs me being too tall ).<br />The cut is nice. Love the V cut  around the neck and the off shoulders. Not sure how it will look like once I wash it for the first time..."
2.0,This thing is huge. It was bought for my teenager but was too big even for my husband and there's no way to adjust it.
2.0,I got a small but it fit like a large! Not even close! I know it's not supposed to be a tight dress (as you can see in the model photos) but it's just so off on me it's no bueno. The waist part sits on my hips! But pretty print! Wished it could have worked out!<br /><br />They have a shorter version of this dress --may I can try it sometime!
2.0,Onlynthe top portion of this dress is cotton. The bottom is not.
2.0,Cheap quality.  Looks cute.  Should be $20 not $60.  Not big enough to hold my tambourine.
2.0,"Waaay smaller than described in the reviews. Very thin, t-shirt like material just as described."
2.0,"Runs very big. No shape, just looks like you have a  black bag on."
2.0,Very see through. Shorter than expected.
2.0,"no support for DD girls like me, anyone with a hefty chest size, I wouldn't recommend."
2.0,"I bought this as a small gift for my wife, who is a photographer.. I thought that it was an engraved/embedded pendant, but its just a picture behind plastic.... Definitely not what I had expected, and doesn't look half as nice in real life. But, it was very cheap... so yeah"
2.0,Ordered this on July 15 they keep delaying the delivery my 8 wanted ONLY this for his party last week we are Both very disappointed by this
2.0,"The animal printed kind is not sherpa fleece material. Its faux fur, which i am allergic to. Im returning it and will just get a non printed one."
2.0,"Disappointing b/c you are being charged for 3 pairs of underwear but two are simple solid colors and only one pair has the cool venom logo.  Super bummer, why not just sell the one pair, I don't need two blank colors?"
2.0,"It's pretty. However, the clasp broke after wearing it once. They probably need a stronger clasp/chain to support the weight of this piece."
2.0,I didn't think this was really all that well-fitting or helpful.
2.0,"It does not look like stainless steel, it is more like pewter"
2.0,"Very thin, cheap quality faux leather. I think it was way over priced and am returning it."
2.0,"I have a dozen pairs of airlocks, all the same model differing in color only that I have gotten over the years.  I liked the frames and used my vision insurance to just keep getting more pairs each year.  Now the problem is that about 4 or 5 years ago Marchon changed the way the frames attach to lens.  The original method involved a side piece being connected to the frame through one drilled hole and a notch in the side of the lens.  The new method uses two holes drilled in the lens for the same piece and no longer uses a notch.  The result of this is that the temple piece now protrudes further into the lens and is much more visible to you when you are wearing the glasses.  In the original design I couldn't see the temple piece when wearing the glasses, now I see part of the temple piece constantly which was very distracting for a while... but you get used to it.<br /><br />Now the bigger issue is the frames are cheaper now than they used to be.  I haven't suddenly become a rough and tumble MMA fighter, but the current frame with the 2 hole system have broken twice.  One pair broke while under warranty the other about 3 months after the warranty expired.  To me that means the quality has dropped because I can accept one frame in a dozen having a random flaw... but two and both the latest ones using a new design tells me that either the new design has some other flaws in it or the company is nos using inferior material to build the frames."
2.0,"It looks nice and is a nice small size, but it fell apart after only 2 wears.  The straps seperated from the purse.  Not well made.  I was very disappointed."
2.0,Super comfortable sweater but two of the Closure snaps fell off right away after the first wash.
2.0,"The set is cute, but it's way too small to be a size 14."
2.0,"It's cute. But it's too small! That's what I don't like about it. I waited the larger size, I got the smaller one. 😒"
2.0,"Cheap, poor quality. The print is sticky... Comes with a sheet of tissue paper stick to it I guess to prevent other things from sticking to it or peeling the print. This is the kind of print that will crack and peel. The print on mine came already missing several spots (see photos) and a small stain. The stitching around the neck somehow got doubled/overlapped then has lots of loose thread just hanging out of it. Terrible, and a shame 'cause I love the print."
2.0,"I REALLY wanted this dress to work, as it is a beautiful pattern that would look amazing on my hourglass shape. For starters, I was willing to forgive that the stretch satin is extremely thin- think lingerie thin and not the thick kind that appears in the image. I was also willing to forgive that the straps, while adjustable, were extremely long ( If I were to eliminate about 15 inches of strap I'd still be able to adjust it). I was also willing to forgive that the bodice was absolutely HUGE- I wear a B cup so I'm used to items being more forgiving in this area but I honestly think that unless you have Anna Nicole-sized breasts that can hold themselves up on their own like to overinflated basketballs there is no way one could fit into a top that big. I was also willing to forgive that the thighs were a bit tight. The length was also very long, leaving a train of about 2 1/2 feet behind me like a wedding dress. I sew quite a bit, so altering it wouldn't be too much of a problem, BUT one side of the thighs puckered and because the dress is serged and is not lined in the bottom there is no wiggle room to fix the seams or let it out at all.  So, although I like this style so much I would've spent the time to alter it myself it just isn't worth the effort.<br /><br />There are some positive- the dress is beautiful like I mentioned above. Also, when the straps are properly adjusted the waist hits at just the right spot. Also, the front slit is at the perfect height. The color is so pretty as well.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I have to return even though I really, REALLY would have liked this dress had it been made better. If you happen to be tall (like over 6ft), inverse triangle-shaped and extremely large-busted (and I mean, a large chest that is perky), this might work for you but it definitely did not work for me."
2.0,Arrived quickly. When trying on all it did was roll up my midriff
2.0,This was not at all what I expected.  IT'S HUGE...
2.0,I had high expectations for this cute set but it was definitely a let down. The fabric is soft but it’s very heavy and not breathable at all. There’s too much restriction on the band from the shorts that make it uncomfortable. The string from the drawstring is VERY long. I’ve worn it once but overall I’m not impressed.
2.0,"Beautiful watch but after winding it, it only runs for an hour or two.  This is not very practical!  The band states that it is genuine leather but it does not feel like real leather."
2.0,"These are tiny earrings. They would be small on an infant. If you dropped one, you would never find it. I'm afraid one will slip right thru my piercing. I was warned by other reviewers, I've just never seen earrings this small before."
2.0,Dispute ordering an xtra large these were like a size 5. I couldn’t even get a leg in!!  They’re cute tho.
2.0,"Trust other negative reviews of these pants. The pictures make them look so cute. They are NOT! The material is synthetic (polyester/cotton- guessing less than 1% cotton), very heavy and stiff--nothing like real linen or cotton. They are VERY short, too short for me even if I wear them below my hips. I'm 5'5.5"" and 125 lbs; a medium was way too tight in the waist, gave me a muffin top even at my natural waist, which is slender. Super uncomfortable. I wear a 4 or 6 in other pants for reference. Back they go."
2.0,"Made out of spandex material. The photo makes this outfit appear to be made differently.  Unfortunately, I had to return this outfit."
2.0,I got this product I was excited to got<br />But when I try it on it very small suit and it not strushable and the medial design if they hard to push the swim suit up it might reared on you<br />I used the size chart before I order this and it came so small
2.0,I love the ties.  looks very nice.  The promise three clips never was in the packaging!! I don’t know somebody made a mistake or what’s going on with it?? They can ship to me or not even include it! ?? Can somebody let me know???<br />Thx
2.0,I was not very happy with this ring as it did not shine very well and it was very very light gram weight
2.0,My daughter loved her ring and wore it every day despite it being made of the kind of material that turned her skin a greenish tint.  It broke in half after less than a month of use.  I will be replacing it with a different ring in the same style; better luck to us the second time around.
2.0,"This jacket is cut small. I am a 2x 22/24. And when I  buy that size I don't have problems.<br />This jacket is real sharp and very comfy oh,and very very warm. The quality is so amazing,I'm saddened to have to return it... It's fits snug even with a t-shirt on, so no way can I wear it with a sweater ;("
2.0,Dial was too big. Had to return the watch and purchase something else instead
2.0,I have purchased from this company before and earrings fell apart. I was hesitant to try again. I really would love to fully trust and purchase more things. Earrings are beautiful and I pray they do not fall apart.
2.0,Dislike. Color faded after one wash. Cute the first day though.
2.0,Not for Me. I tried these on and had to laugh. These remind of the glasses that they wear in the 70's they are so oversized and fall off my face. They are more brown than rose gold. The frame is gold metal and just feel cheap when I wore them. A big no for me I am not going to the disco anytime soon.
2.0,"Way too small, definitely order up a size or two. I ordered a size up because of reviews and it was still too small."
2.0,They didnt fit because they were extended out too wide to fit on your head and ears
2.0,"The material is very sheer and clings to your face making it a poor choice for a face covering if you have to wear it for a considerable amount of time. When you breathe through your mouth, you will suck it up against your mouth because the fabric is so thin.<br />No hem is sewn into the edges so it falls off your nose very easily.<br />It's basically just cut fabric, with no hems.<br />I wanted something as an alternative to a mask. This isn't it. Too flimsy. Good for other uses though. (Hair head band  maybe?)"
2.0,Sizing is off. Idea behind this type of bra is great but you need to size up a couple sizes.
2.0,"I ordered a small with a bust of 36C, height 4' 11&#34;, 115# and the criss-cross tabs in the front were so loose and sloppy looking. Am sending it back."
2.0,Did not like the hat. It looked cheap. Necklace did not match earrings.
2.0,"Style is nice, not sure on comfort as run too small & seem to have received two for left foot. Returning."
2.0,"This is a very heavy swim parka.  Weight wise, it's so much heavier than the fleece brands.  I had to return it because I couldn't imagine lugging it around all the time.  I liked the cotton lining instead of the fleece but in the end, it was just too heavy."
2.0,"I am a medium but small usually fits. I decided to stick with my original size and the sizing is way off. I was able to put on the dress, but to zip was the problem. It wouldn’t go up once I reached halfway of my back. I even decided to put on my waist trainer to see if it could help, but no."
2.0,The fit is odd around the neck and looks nothing like the photo
2.0,"[[VIDEOID:a9ab8e23c8bad527916d34b7fa0f3fd1]] I'm giving this a 2 star because out of the whole set of nose rings I was mostly excited for the opals and they weren't even opals. I even bought a belly ring to match witch I will show its opal in another picture/video for comparison but ALL the nose ring opals was just a dirty white and a dirty blue color. So I was disappointed in that but as far as the others that weren't opal, those were decent."
2.0,After two weeks the zipper does not work because it was made from a cheap plastic and metal substance so it bent and now will not stay closed to zip up very disappointed:(
2.0,Only okay. Don't think it makes that much a difference. Cheap sunglasses
2.0,Its very pretty but very small more for a child
2.0,"I returned it... i think the chest / waist would have fit fine and the length was good, the sleeves were so odd. The fabric was pretty though."
2.0,Cheap material not very flattering. Not worth the money
2.0,I absolutely love these leggings but I've only had them a month and the seams are splitting :(
2.0,"Nothing really wrong with the item, jut not as cute as expected in person. Also thinner than expected."
2.0,"I just received,its begger than what i expected,i odered blue,but purple came,its ok not that cute seen in pic.i think blue was more nice,if you dont have on pls  dont show in pic"
2.0,"It was ok the hood camr undone when we got it, we sent it back"
2.0,"Pros: the tie in the front is really cute. The color is vibrant.<br />Cons: The torso of the swimsuit ran a little small. The way the suit looks high cut on the model’s hips isn’t reality. It is more normal cut. The WORST part of this bathing suit is the padding. Totally visible and it can’t be easily removed. If I did remove it, everything underneath would be visible. I’ll never wear this."
2.0,"pls, how is this supposed to be about Black Lives Matter and black excellence and had a whole blue lives matter pin. disrespectful asl! other than that the Pins are cute"
2.0,"Tunic is beautiful,  but made in China and is very small and tight.  There are no wash instructions or tags on the tunic. This is the 3rd item I've ordered on a whim without checking where it's coming from.  It would seem that all things from China-based sellers run an average of 1-2 sizes too small.  Disappointment."
2.0,Fit fair
2.0,"Adorable sneakers... But we've had them for six days.  My daughter has worn these three times, and the crystals are all falling off.  I realize they are not the most expensive shoes, but they should be holding up better than this.  I'm disappointed."
2.0,Plaid skirt is made from very thin material. The eye hook at the top flog the zipper already broke off. I am not satisfied with the quality of the skirt. Only reason I have it two stars is because it’s cute.
2.0,to much bling for a beach throw - more like a belly-dancer costume
2.0,Was super cute until it turned my ear green....
2.0,"The shoes come in the mail in a damaged box, about 2 weeks later than expected and 2 sizes smaller than should be. I returned it but wasted my time and shipping fees."
2.0,"Too big, had to return.  Refund was fast"
2.0,There ok they very thin
2.0,"These glasses are okay, the shape is cute, but the quality is crap. They're like sunglasses you might buy at a gas station, or the kind of glasses you'd get for $9...My bad for expecting more I guess, afterall, you get what you pay for, but I foolishly believed the item description.<br /><br />If you just want some cheap cute sunglasses, these are fine but if you are expecting them to be polarized, (you know, because the description says they are) you will be disappointed. If the seller had just been honest I would have given these a much higher rating, if I thought I was just getting some cheapie glasses, I would have gotten exactly what I was expecting, but since the seller lied and stated these were polarized, they don't meet expectations."
2.0,"Nothing, I gave it as a gift"
2.0,To short but I  am 5ft 11.
2.0,It is too long and sticks out of your nose. The prongs stick out and get caught and it is not shiny or sparkly at all.  Very disappointed.
2.0,For the cost it is not well put together.  If my son didn't love it I would have sent it back.  The hook for the tail wasn't even attached.
2.0,I ordered an XL for myself. I usually wear a womans 16. The dress didn't fit me. It did fit my size 8 daughter and looked cute on her.
2.0,"The colors are all wrong and different from the picture. The tie dye pattern is different. These is not any purple on this it seems entirely pink and light blue.<br /><br />It runs large, for sure, adult S seems possibly more like adult M or even adult L.<br /><br />This is not a cotton sweatshirt. This is made of technical fabric, 95% poly, 5% spandex. It is very stretchy from the spandex. Feels more like leggings or something. It has the glossy softness of a technical fabric. It still feels like it is likely warm and insulating but nothing like a thicker true sweatshirt.<br /><br />Honestly other than running large it seems nice -- but not having something look like the picture is pretty unforgivable in my opinion."
2.0,A little bit cheesy I wouldn't buy it again
2.0,"Didn't even try on. Quality looked good, but the orange color was bright neon construction vest orange. Pictures make it seem lighter and more peachy. Very disappointed"
2.0,If you have a DD chest do not buy these they are worthless and make your bust look very ummm......funky yeah funky is a good word for it
2.0,Not a lot of give (doesn’t stretch out enough); messy sewing job (strings hanging out/loose).
2.0,These were wonderful when we first received them. Now half of the lights on each shoe do not light up. Very disappointing.
2.0,"This Shapeware runs very small, I returned it and replaced it with a different plan a child very happy"
2.0,"THIS IS NOT A CHOKER. DON'T BE FOOLED. The necklace is wayy longer than a choker. And it is too short to be wrapped around my neck twice. It's just one long necklace, so you can't adjust the length. When I am wearing it the eye faces down so you can hardly see the eye. Some of the paint on the backside chipped off right when I got it. It is a beautiful eye, but I am very disappointed.."
2.0,I did not enjoy the feel of this shirt and the graphics are very poor. Not impressed and the fit was also very awkward. I’m 5’7 and about 160 pounds. I am busty and hippy with a short torso. I ordered a large and this shirt looks ridiculous on me.
2.0,"Rips so easily, such thin layer and very large."
2.0,"I really liked the design of these sunglasses, they fit well and the gradient level was perfect.  But I took them on vacation with me, and after wearing them for the first few days, they broke right at the hinge.  I was so disappointed since I liked them so well.  Had the quality been a little better, it might have sustained years of wear."
2.0,I received a differentFloral-Print
2.0,The fabric is very thin - could be see-through in areas that get stretched.  The colors are almost too bright to be pretty for anything other than very casual wear.  Runs large.
2.0,I have very skinny legs yet it was almost impossible to get them off.  I had to have some one help me.<br />Terrible
2.0,"best for women with B cup or smaller, but beautiful"
2.0,The arm holes were exceptionally large. I didn't like it and returned it.
2.0,"Not particularly comfortable on my head. Wanted to return it, but was only going to get about half my money back, then I just forgot about it. Inexpensive enough that I don’t mind - but keep that in mind, because it’s super plastic-y. Ended up going out and buying a Specialized helmet instead."
2.0,Maybe because of my size or I had to high of expectations but the fit on this shirt is just a tight tank top not really a compression shirt. I'm a big guy at 6'2 350 with a bit of a gut. I wanted a compression shirt just to look better in dress shirts for work but I have to wear all 3 of these shirts to get the desired effect I was hoping for. Still a great undershirt but don't buy if youre looking g for a compression/slimming shirt.
2.0,I was shocked at the poor quality of this wallet after reading the many positive reviews. It smells like leather but it is the thinnest leather I have ever seen. I am returning because I don't see this being durable at all. It seemed like a good buy but not worth it even at this low price. Seems like something you would find at a dollar store.
2.0,Has some defects in manufacturing isues
2.0,You go in knowing they’re not going to be the best quality but these were really cheap.  And not that easy to use - even for a kid that picks things fast.
2.0,flimsy and not durable.  snapped/tore off the watch within months
2.0,Very bulky and not that pretty as shown
2.0,Ordered iloveDIYbeads 100g (about 100pcs)  Small Antique Silver Animals Charms. Received TREES! Def not a 100 count.
2.0,Only for small busted women.  I'm a 38B.  Didn't cover my chest well.  returned.
2.0,"The sole of the water shoe is shaped like a cartoon foot, not an actual human baby foot. When my son wears them he trips because of the oddly designed sole."
2.0,Waste of time cute but do not stay in place and you look stupid and have to constantly push up to stay on and not look like a paper clip
2.0,I just received these today and they are super cute but 2 of them were way too short and didn't fit(shorter than the rest)  and 2 others were broke. I would like to just get this replaced if possible but don't see anywhere to contact seller.  Pretty bummed
2.0,Very rough.material. definitely.the length is like a short shirt
2.0,Two of then broke in half while trying to take the  all off.
2.0,"It fits pretty small, the texture of the dress looks cheap"
2.0,There was a picked stitch on the lettering
2.0,Had to melt the cords with a lighter to hold them together. The tjing starting falling apart straight out the package
2.0,bought these on Jan 5th by march 8 and 5 rides the zipper broke other than that there good
2.0,The material was horrible and they were huge
2.0,I was sent 2 pairs of extra large and 1 regular size as described. 2 of them were not cotton blends. They are very pretty and the correct size fit well. They are a set so all of them had to go back.
2.0,"Bought the red and black polka dot, both in size Medium. The black is more sized like a large and the red is sized like an extra small + the sleeve ripped while trying it on. Not the best experience"
2.0,The fabric is too slick so it slips off everywhere.. Theybare wayyyyyy too short.
2.0,Low quality product for a high price. I was expecting a more seamless fitting bezel
2.0,"Cute bracelet I wore with my bridesmaid dress; however, at the end of the evening, I realized one of the &#34;pearls&#34;  had fallen off. It was clearly glued on, as I could see the remnant of glue where it once was, but it clearly wasn't very longlasting glue. It was very gently worn that day, so no fault of my own."
2.0,"It’s super soft, warm, and cozy but it’s not very cute. It fits weird - I thought it would be longer. And it’s not made very well. It’s a bit cheapy. But like I said, I will wear it at home in the winter as a house coat."
2.0,The tie arrived with cuts and imperfections that were clearly not part of the linen pattern.
2.0,Less than 10 yards in. Wasted 2 plus yards for 2 times and a bad spot. Not happy.
2.0,Tip change colors...making it look very cheap..dont buy!! Junk
2.0,The pants have elastic so they fit fine. The jacket is more of a slim cut so it didn’t fit my shoulders and chest. Nice length of the sleeves though. It’s a light weight material.
2.0,I stopped using them half way through a 3 week trip. Don't compress well and more items fit in my bag without them. I really wanted this to work. 😒
2.0,its very small.  Especially in the sleeves.
2.0,Picture was a lot more appealing than the actual product to bad short and cheap
2.0,"At first, it was great. Got tons of compliments on it. However, soon after the latch cracked but still worked. Now the entire latch has fallen apart and the wallet is no longer usable."
2.0,The clasp on the wrist watch band is very poorly made.  The watch fell off my wrist about 30 seconds after I put it on. Have returned the watch.
2.0,Dress not what I expected.  I don’t like it.  Makes me look fatter than normal.
2.0,Very small esp after reading previous comments I must have gotten a different one because it’s not big at all. it’s cute but you can barely see the butterfly
2.0,I like the color material was a little snug
2.0,I'm an average man with a wrist circ of 7.5 inches. This was still too small. I wore it a couple of days and it did not interfere with my daily duties. Actually didn't notice it was on me at all until I took it off that night. Several indentations in my wrist that almost looked bruised.  Beydodo--I have an answer for this. offer several sizes!! Paracord is cheap--add some to fit men-sizes!!!
2.0,I ordered the size 2-4 for my 2.5 year old and it's too small. However it seems to be of good quality.
2.0,"I ordered xl and it fix too tight, it is somewhat small. Im in between large and xl, however this appears to be cut smaller."
2.0,"Its a nice T-shirt, but, I ordered an Xtra Large. This is NOT an xtra large. It says Xtra Large on the tag but actually fits like a shmeium or Xtra Medium."
2.0,"Constantly pops open. It's comfortable and inexpensive, but it doesn't keep the gear on."
2.0,I wore this to go wine tasting and after wearing it for only 2 hours the sleeves ripped off. Do not recommend.
2.0,"The size conversion was wrong. This is labeled as 7.5 US size. however, this is a size 40 Euro size which is a 9.5 US women’s (7.5 US MENS). As many countries do not have different sizes for women and men feet, this is an easy mistake to make. However, I cannot get a reply to return the shoes that are 2 sizes too big"
2.0,"The fit was weird in the groin area. It drw attention to things that nobody ought to be paying attention to on a child, if you understand what I mean. Hence, I'm not submitting pictures with this review."
2.0,Ordered my size but the it doesn't fit. The cuz size is way off
2.0,The bra looks like it would perform as it was intended however I will not be able to prove that since it is too small for me to wear.
2.0,too small does not look like picture.
2.0,"The strap is too skinny, more of a string so zero support. It would look better with a thicker strap. The white was transparent and showed nipples. The skirt was loose and flowy which was unexpected and didn't fit the style in my opinion. Fabric does not flatter hips and derriere. Runs a little large."
2.0,"way too small,  and I ordered the recommended 1 size larger.  2 sizes larger  would probably  be better ."
2.0,"These have a very uncomfortable, odd fit like... boxy? The material is soft but very thin."
2.0,Sizing is way off. I usually wear a small and based on the reviews ordered a medium--still too small. Waist is not at the appropriate level. Had to return the dress. Unfortunately the credit to my account took 5 weeks and 2 phone calls.
2.0,"The string is so thin connecting the main piece to the larger string. The larger string I had hope to tie around my neck, and it's too small. I will probably get a key ring and make a hemp necklace or something like that."
2.0,"Unfortunately while it did fit fine,  it wasn't flattering at all. The cut didnt lay right."
2.0,Don't stay up.
2.0,The opening for the heel is way too small
2.0,The top fits but the bottom is too small
2.0,The weight of the chain and the rubber stay seem to cause the glasses to slip out. I found myself picking up my glasses several times today and decided that this wasn't for me. I'm returning it. I went to the standard rope lanyard that you use for sunglasses and the same type of rubber stay and it works perfect!
2.0,Don't really trust in my ears. I cleaned well but was still getting a metallic color residue on q tip. The threads look like they have bits of shavings on them. I wore 1 pair for a week but was little itchy and I am not sensitive at all.
2.0,"Unflattering, boxy cut and so short!"
2.0,Very difficult to snap together and you have to make a hole in your sock to get it through.
2.0,The belly area of this dress is extremely large and the dress itself is ill-fitting.  I'm normally a size 4 and ordered a medium.  I gained about 50lbs during pregnancy but the belly area sagged a good deal.
2.0,It's true to size but it doesn't look what it does in the picture. Still very pretty though.
2.0,Poor quality.....left marks on my skin
2.0,"Ripped along seams within a week, fine for light use but nothing daily."
2.0,"the blue stone is very vibrant and pretty, the scroll work on the sides of the ring are what drew me in and the actual ring doesn't have the intricate design that the picture shows... but for 2 bucks, it's fine. I won't purchase again from this company but at least it wasn't an expensive mistake."
2.0,"They are so padded on the tongue, that my feet go numb"
2.0,It's cute but not nearly as vibrant as the picture shows.  I don't even want to use it.
2.0,"Wanted to love them- but as I stand a little under 5’7 these are ridiculously short on me. There’s no way I can leave the house in them- unless there’s an actual flood happening. They’re also too big, I’m athletic 140lbs. Just weird fitting all around.<br />Bah."
2.0,The glasses were very flimsy and seemed like they had been broken previously.
2.0,"Basically rubber gloves with claws.<br />I feel the rubber is made of cheap plastic from 99 cent stores.<br />The claw is ok.  It serve its purpose.<br />Price is expensive,  since the rubber is cheap. I'll give it 3 star still because of the idea.  They're worth the try.<br /><br />Update.  Less than one month of use without abuse.  The claws fell off.  Another negative point is that the claw leaves space between the gloves and the claw so dirt will get in there.  This space issue also decrease my &#34;clawing power&#34;, it feel wobbly using it.  Looks like I need to see my manicurist to glue them back on.  2 stars for the idea."
2.0,Color was good. I ordered a size 4 for my petite 3 year old based on the other reviews saying these run small. The size 4 shirts were barely a 2T.  I had to return them.
2.0,"It is exactly what it looks like but flimsier and than I expected.  I missed my return deadline so I’ll find some way of making it work.  It’s really see through and short.  It is completely open in the front so I’ll definitely need to wear leggings with it.  I’m thinking that I will dye the fabric (I bought the white pinstripe) so it’s a little more opaque and then find some leggings to match.  It’s all I can do at this point.  It definitely can not be worn by itself, especially outside with any wind at all.  I bought it for a trip to DC in July.  I’ll probably leave it at home."
2.0,I received this bag and was disappointed. the top zipper was coming apart from the seam it was sewed into.I spent a lot of money for quality and didn't receive it.
2.0,"Ended up being too short to go in my ear, the back actually started cutting into my ear"
2.0,"I knew this wouldn't be super high quality, but it's barely even low quality!  It is paper thin, and not the least bit soft.  The stripes are painted on, making that side really rough and uncomfortable.  I definitely would not recommend this to anyone..."
2.0,Didn’t match my size and it was not stretchy
2.0,"The bag’s looks far exceed its utility. Roomy enough but have to constantly dig in the bottom to find what you want. The shoulder strap is way too long to realistically sling, gotta be over your head to compensate. I first tried tacking it together to shorten it and ended up cutting It off - permanently attached and would be better if it could be removed without destroying it. Finally, six weeks after I bought it the main zipper jammed on itself. No lining or such was stuck in it and was impossible to budge. But not to worry. Had decided to keep it and endure so my utility knife bypassed the zipper. Useless bag ready for the trash!!"
2.0,"Gave it to a friend that was 2x smaller than me, looked cute on her bc it was flowy... it was more fitted on me.. didn’t like"
2.0,Worked great for a few months with working in it but wore it in the ocean once and now it doesn't work.
2.0,I was so excited about this dress to wear going back into the office but the quality of the material is poor and it’s thin and see-through so I’ll be returning it.
2.0,Looks thick on line very thin and the earring sticks out from your face.
2.0,Sides/pockets stick out into points too much. Looks weird
2.0,"I ordered the lack patton sandals.  Thiugh pretty, they are extra wide."
2.0,Shirt faded quick...but I do get a lot of compliments on it even tho it's faded 🤦🏽‍♀️🤣
2.0,"This vest has fewer pockets than the men's version, and so it is not as functional. The photo makes it look like this vest has a feminine cut with a nipped waist, but the actual product hangs straighter. I returned it and ordered the men's version instead because the men's version is more functional."
2.0,"These glasses say they fit size small, but they don’t. I emailed customer service regarding this and he seemed like he wanted to resolve the issue but really just wanted to challenge me regarding size. They were very wide across the forehead and ears and when I bent over, they would fall off. I was disappointed with the fit."
2.0,When the dress came in it was 2 completely different colors! It was black on top and then faded navy on the bottom. Very disappointed
2.0,"Thin fabric and that cross in the back does nothing to support you, and the front has no padding so you’d have to be careful what top you wear with it. Also the hooks down the front jab me in the chest."
2.0,"The fit is fine but I absolutely despise this bra; it is stiff, doesn't move with the body, has an awkward feel when wearing and overall feels very cheaply made. I don't expect it to last long and frankly, probably prefer it doesn't last long because I'd hate to wear this thing on a regular basis. I tried two of these - a push up and a t-shirt bra both in the same size. Hate them both."
2.0,Awkward fit-too tight up top. Wrinkles at waist from material bunching is unflattering.
2.0,Online it looked gorgeous! When i got it though it was slightly disappointing. The straps on the back are wider than the picture and the sleeve are wider as well. It looks cheaply made. It’s see through. And runs two sides to small at least. It’ll work for what i needed it for though.
2.0,"This product was perfect fitting every where but the waist that was stiff with no give, the rest of the skirt fit perfectly. Honestly very disappointed! Because if I went up a size the skirt would have not been a pencil skirt. So medium was the proper size , but the skirts waist was wrong."
2.0,Loved the color but the size was large but sleeves short and tight.. bizarre
2.0,"The fit was perfect but after only 3 wears all the elastic has started breaking on the seams and it is not wearable any more. Such a shame because the skirt is gorgeous, the length is perfect and the stretchy fit is so wonderful (even leaving room so my stomach isn't squished)."
2.0,Sizes run verry small
2.0,"The glasses were great until they , the frame started peeling."
2.0,"This dress was so cute, I wish it actually fit appropriately the chest was extremely big and I am large chested. It hung way down and showed my bra. The waist was super snug. The fabric was like bathing suit material."
2.0,Buckle part falls off easily. First day I used it. These should be removed from the Amazon store
2.0,"As the reviews stated, it was not the same material pictured. It's cute but for my body it doesn't hang to my liking. I wear it as a shirt with leggings. Only because I didn't want it to be a total waste of money."
2.0,clearly not designed for tall women
2.0,Very uncomfortable.  Seams in armpit region rub quite unpleasantly.
2.0,"Disappointed, material is shiny opaque polyester. Hood lining possibly some cotton. Design is as shown. Sizing - didn't bother to try it on."
2.0,clip -on is clumsy and big - don't like these at al.  I bought these for my partner and he won't use them - very clumsy.l
2.0,"Ok, but you get what you pay for :("
2.0,"This jacket would probably be okay if the sizing was not so off. There is no way what I received should be sized as an extra large. I definitely should have given more credence to other reviewers stating that the jacket runs small. It's not just small but extremely small. As I write this review, I'm wearing, for comparison, a St. John's Bay jacket, XL that is actually a bit large. In the future, I will definitely believe other reviewers when they write that an item runs small. I will return for a refund, not a replacement because, if there's an XXL available, I'm not sure that would fit."
2.0,"Due to the reviews, I bought two pairs of these shorts. The overall quality does appear to be very good, but the style of this short is different than pictures show because the length of the short is inches longer and not loose, but instead more fitting to the leg contour. Disappointing. I sent them back."
2.0,"This sweater was pretty and I liked the stitching, however the sweater was cut for huge hips, which I don't have.  Have never seen a sweater seam sewed to expand two inches on each side before.  Had to send it back and pay return postage on it.  Will make a note not to purchase items that don't have free return in the future."
2.0,"Fit well on my watch strap, but they are not as sturdy.<br />Still testing them ."
2.0,"I didn't read the fine print that said that only the collar is wool/Pollyanna blend. I also didn't check where it was made or I wouldn't have purchased it because I've never gotten good clothing or shoes from China. Ever. The stitching stinks...my button wholes are non?-existent. If I wash my garment, they will unravel and ruin the look. I'm taking mine to a seamstress. The buttons are cheap. I'm replacing those. There are many areas where there wasn't any backspacing. It would be fine if you don't button it up and never wash it. Good luck with that."
2.0,"Correa didicil de manipular y de usar con el pantalon, el producto debe ser perfeccionado, no entra en los pantalones con ancho regular de trabillas."
2.0,I am giving this product two stars only because it is not a matte color as advertised in the description (the red is not matte either).  I actually still really like the style of the earrings- they are the right amount of hip for me!  They are not too heavy.  They have a shiny black finish. No hardware is visible when in your ear.
2.0,I wouldn't buy this item I don't recommend it. It turned rusty and had a smell to it. Very disappointing!
2.0,To big. More like a 2 XL
2.0,"These are being promoted as glass, but they're not, they're a hard plastic 😔"
2.0,This ring tarnished so quickly after I bought it and hoped it was real silver as it has a stamp but it looks like silver plating and that is annoying
2.0,Two bags fell apart within the first month of use.
2.0,Very weird fabric that made my daughters butt look huge!! Didn’t lay right on her body at all.
2.0,The blue/ black check is 100% cotton. The asuka red is 100% cheap looking polyester or rayon.
2.0,"Looks nice but I'm afraid to give it to my niece for Xmas. The loop that's attached to it, is very cheap and looks like it will open easily. Debating if I should return it ."
2.0,The little metal clasp doesn’t stay. When trying to put watch on it takes two people 🤦🏻‍♀️ Because the metal clasp will pop out of the holes.
2.0,"I'm 6'4&quot; and 212lbs athletic build (36W, 33L). I ordered the XXL on these because after reading over fifty reviews I was convinced that I needed to order one size up. But these joggers run extremely slim and short. Unfortunately I ordered three pair instead of one to test them out. I don't feel like going through the hassle of returning them so I'll probably use them as pajamas. The good thing about them and the reason why I gave them 2 stars instead of 1 is that they are extremely soft and the cotton feels great! Like I said they will make great pajamas in the winter."
2.0,I normally fit in a large. I ordered the large and extra large just to be safe. I tried the extra large and it was too small. Returned them both.
2.0,Couldn't get the silly thing on! Had to send it back.  That'll teach me that fads stands for &#34;fades away damned soon&#34;.
2.0,"Didn't fit me, gave it to my daughter."
2.0,I ordered this to help hold on my toddlers glasses. The rubber loops that go on the temples of the glasses keep coming loose. The whole strap then falls off.
2.0,Wore this watch for 2 days and it turned my wrist green.  Not dependable.  Might get new strap because the watch face is nice.
2.0,"Quality of the mask is fine, but the inside has an eye-watering stench of latex comparable to freshly drying paint. Hard to spend more than a few minutes inside without getting a little nauseated."
2.0,"Wasnt really what I'd consider HD, kind of disappointed."
2.0,"Nice, but not big enough to fit over my (relatively small) glasses."
2.0,"UPDATE: I reduced my 5 stars rating to two. I've not had these for even one year and today I noticed a three inch hole inside the right slipper in the toe area. The lining is worn through and I do not wear these every day or even every week. Poor quality.<br /><br />It's genuine suede. I have bought 3 pairs of different brands and these were the only ones that were wide enough for me. I wear an 8.5 women's wide shoe so I sized up. Glad I did since these run short. Barely half an inch from my big toe. Not well padded but has heavy-duty rubber bottoms for comfort. They've already begun to get wider on me after one day's use. Very soft suede and priced right but Chinese made, fwiiw. I plan to put cushioned innersoles in if they stretch out more."
2.0,After wearing these a few times one of the lenses popped out. I love the color and how polarized the lenses are. Glasses are still wearable but just disappointing that they'll have to be exchanged or returned.
2.0,"Really cute, nice fabric, but strap broke the first time I wore it. I expected higher quality for the $."
2.0,Contrary to the previous reviews my shirt was HUGE.<br />I'll usually buy a large from most stores and ordered up due to reviews and even after two dryer cycles this fits very loose and baggy. Costs too much to exchange to justify it.
2.0,"I ordered this sleeve while I was in the process of getting a sleeve tattoo. The sleeve was finished recently and with the warmer weather our uniform went to short sleeves.<br />I measured my arm and fell in the XL range. So bought that.  First time I wore it, it seemed to fit but by the end of the day it was too loose.  Washed it and it did the same thing next time. Now I don’t even wear it. I should have ordered a size smaller.<br />My experience is if you are on the fence on the size, go smaller."
2.0,The fit around the leg is too big but overall ok item
2.0,These glasses are no wider than standard pairs ... I guess they are alright for the price but they are definitely no wider!!
2.0,The color of the product isn’t the same as pictured.
2.0,"These pantyhose were ok. I wouldn't consider them ""compression"" though and there's not much control either. The material is lightweight, a little scratchy, and didn't hug in as much as other brands I've used.  They would be a ""good enough"" stocking to wear to work on a slow day but I wouldn't depend on them not to tear on a day with important meetings scheduled or a dressy evening out."
2.0,Did not fit my head of hair
2.0,I wanted to love this shirt.  And I did.  Until I started wearing it and discovered the plastic tag near the bottom.  It felt like a razor blade.  I tried cutting the tag out but the way that it is sewn in a sharp edge remained.  The only way to stop the agony was to cut the thread to completely remove the tag.  That move left a hole.  Disappointed as it was a nice shirt that fit well.
2.0,Nice concept but too big for my head. Comes all the way down over my face.
2.0,"These were much, MUCH too small."
2.0,"Too big, weird high part at front of hat"
2.0,They are cute but few broke right away and most off them have turn green already. Very disappointed how bad the material is. Regret buying too many at once
2.0,"Ok for the price, but not the best quality"
2.0,Really difficult to use its features. Seemed overly complicated for a rather inexpensive watch. Returned it immediately.
2.0,I really liked the softness of the inside. I wore it barely 2 x's and there were all tiny balls (pills) all on the sides. Don't waste your money.
2.0,It is ok does a travel bag.
2.0,"I ordered the XL for the number size 8-10 because I wear 8-10. The bottoms fit good. The body part of the top fits good too, but the cups are too big and don't hold any shape. I'd say if you are really busty, like a DD or bigger, this would fit but I don't know if it would have enough support to hold you up. The colors are bright, print is fun and quality is decent other than the cups are just awkward. I don't even know if a smaller top would solve the problem. I think quite a few of the other reviews said the cups were big too. Too much gap in cups to wear :(<br /><br />If it helps: I wear a women's Medium on top and bottom or size 8-10. I'm 5'5&#34; and 150 lbs, bra size is 34 C-D"
2.0,The fit of the dress was extremely small. I'm usually a US 14/16. And I purchased the largest size and still it didn't fit.
2.0,The dress and color is cute but the bottom portion is too large. I have a pretty balance body but I noticed that it seems more like a Medium vs a small. The strings are also kinda weird. You haven’t pull them so that they adjust. The are sowed in.
2.0,"The dress I received looks somewhat to the dress pictured, but it's not! It's not cut the same way at the top and the stitching at the waist is a much inferior quality.  I have the dress pictured in black that I now realized was purchased from another vendor and although it's hard to see in the picture because it's black, it's a different cut with much better gathering at the waist.  Returning it and purchasing the right dress."
2.0,"Arrived on time. I like the purse but came with scratches already on it, like it had been used."
2.0,Ordered my normal size and it is not as fitted as the picture depicts. Comfy despite being a bit big.
2.0,The face is too small. It looked like a woman's watch when I put it on my wrist. Couldn't resize it.
2.0,"There's the old adage that we should plan for the worst and hope for the best. Well, I hoped for the best and what I received was a necklace of stunning beauty but minus stones and so badly tangled, it took awhile to get it all sorted out. I'll repair the piece and wear it, but honestly, it is frustrating to see it arrive this way."
2.0,They were both too boxy for me. I am short and curvy and neither were flattering. The fabric was nice.
2.0,"Easy to use; easy on the fingernails; easy to lose items attached to it.  The Ti ring was so easy to put keys on and off that I was worried about durability.  What I failed to foresee was this past weekend's 300 mile trip on my motorcycle where the ""ease of use"" allowed 3 keys and a titanium pill fob to vibrate their way out/off of the keyring.  Luckily the 3 keys were still in and around the area of the ignition/cables/fork uppers.  The pill fob not so much.  So my replacement pill fob just arrived (Yay Amazon!) and I am back to a standard style Ti keyring (as seen in the pic).  Oh well - lesson learned."
2.0,While this is a very cute set the top runs VERY small.  I got a 2XL knowing that it likely ran a little small but didn't expect it to be this small.
2.0,Poor quality. Very lightweight. Was looking for something made of a heavier metal.
2.0,Extremely small for price!
2.0,The color and thickness of these tights are perfect! However the seams on these things are awful!! I can get them up (barely) but the seams cut into my inner thigh and make it so uncomfortable.
2.0,The quality of the lenses is very disappointing. I did not expect them to be like glass but they appear 'warped' in places which really makes it difficult to read or use the computer. I have trouble focusing both eyes and find myself constantly switching back and forth between eyes. I have been wearing them on and off now for several months and only use them as a backup when my old (scratched) glasses are not in sight. They are better than nothing but cause too much eye fatigue to be useful for more than a few minutes at a time.
2.0,"I read the reviews that they were long, but I'm 5'10&#34; and 160 and were short on me.  I got a large and the thickness and fit were good, except for the length.  will be returning"
2.0,Loosens easily. Have to keep adjusting magnet doesn’t hold
2.0,"I like this watch band, turquoise is my go to.  The problem is I have only worn it 3 times and one of the stones has already fallen out....now it looks pretty cheap.  I have attempted to contact the seller to see if they will stand behind the product.  Will update when (or if) I have additional information.<br />Update:  It is difficult to reach the seller, and they do not respond. UPDATE:  No one ever responded and three more stones have fallen out."
2.0,Cute earring but the quality is not that great. They broke after  a few times wearing them. I would not recommend them.
2.0,I don't think it's  real .and the box says made in China so...I wanted to send it back .i unfortunately damaged the package 🙅🏼
2.0,Bottoms were way to big and top keeps riding up. For size reference I ordered a small and am 5'1&#34; and 120 lbs.
2.0,"If you want a large , buy an XL. That was my experience."
2.0,This dress material is so thick and not stretchy at all.  It runs very small Since there is no give to the material. I can't imagine wearing It if it did fit cause the material is so thick. Very disappointed.
2.0,"Well, after a month of owning this item, it is falling apart.<br />The stitching is unraveling and the inside seam has ripped.<br />I only used this maybe 12 times, as I have been using my Toki doki more as of late.<br />So, for the money I spent on it, completely NOT worth it.<br />It will be going in the garbage shortly."
2.0,"Horrible quality & it looks nothing like the photos. I will have to tailor this, as the sizing is off, I got the smallest size. Looks like a cheap maid party city costume."
2.0,"returned.<br />the hook is not sealed, easy to fall apart."
2.0,Didn’t care for overall look.
2.0,I like the weight of the sweater.  I don't know why they would not finish the collar.  Frayed and not good looking.  :(
2.0,I liked it but went on vacation and wore it while sweating on my bicycle.. The end of the day had terrible itchy Raj on wrist..changed to other arm and same thing happened but quicker ..I suspect that sweating caused some chemical to leak out causing the dermatitis..had to toss it out.. if it's leather it is altered somehow
2.0,"It won’t stay up by itself. It’s colorful and thin , I wouldn’t buy it again."
2.0,It’s a cute shirt but I expected it to be less fitted and somewhat lose.
2.0,Runs small but advertised as runs true to size ☹️
2.0,"The fit is as advertised. The pattern and material are actually quite nice. However, This maxi does not have built in shorts. The description clearly states it has built in shorts. It is a very short miniskirt front piece. It's not even a full mini skirt under the panels. The full length of the back of the dress is one solid piece and then as if an after thought -a piece of material added under the panels to make it appear that boy shorts are an element of the design when in reality it's a very short mini skirt like feature to create the illusion that it has shorts."
2.0,Product looks like pictured but it's extremely small! I purchased a 6 and it looks like a 4T! Very disappointed! I ordered this as a Christmas present for my son :(
2.0,Very Small But Thank u
2.0,Couple of washes and you can see thru them. Lousy fabric quality. Only thing about them that they are soft. That's it!
2.0,Very inexpensive material
2.0,"Most uncomfortable bra I have ever had. Too small on the sides, but too  much extra material in the cup area."
2.0,Not the same color it's light gray but it is soft but I got a xl for more lose fitted but I normally wear a large but glad I did get xl fit like a large
2.0,That pattern is like the picture but as you can tell it’s really short like a regular jacket. And my daughter is shorter than average so I’m not sure if we got the wrong product?
2.0,"I wore the rose colored earring twice before they began to fade. You get what you pay for, good for one or two wears."
2.0,[[VIDEOID:d1373d407e3e02689856a474202d461e]] Arrived with broken pieces. Stones are “hot glued” so they are not going to last through the occasion I needed them for.
2.0,Product is cut/sewn weird. One other person commented the same and it’s true. Looks like a snout. Scratchy inside material. One of my least favorite masks so far.
2.0,"I've only had it for a couple of weeks, and the knot unravelled and it fell apart."
2.0,"We replaced the first one since the battery died in less than a month. A couple months later and now this replacement watch’s battery is also dying. It’s a nice design and the velcro is great and overall has put up with wear and tear from the daily use of a 6 year old boy. I’m disappointed the battery life is so poor. We are going to see if a jeweler is able to replace the battery and maybe get something that will have a longer life. Otherwise we’ll call it and go shopping for a new one. Too bad, an otherwise nice watch for a kid."
2.0,I expected these to be sweatpants. They are made with the same materials as yoga pants and so you don’t have the soft cozy feel of sweatpants nor do you get the tight compression of leggings or yoga pants. It’s somewhere in between and not very flattering.
2.0,Really wanted to love this hat. Good quality but way too small for my big head.<br />If your head is any larger than average you will look ridiculous in it.
2.0,"I'm glad this suit worked for others, but it was a no go for me.  I purchased two different sizes, the larger of which was much too large.  I'm 5'3, 130, 32DD and the front of the suit was open to my navel and offered no support, was just two flimsy pieces barely covering my chest.  There was no way to position the front to offer more coverage or support.  Pretty print/color and nice fabric though.  Sad it didn't work."
2.0,My daughter was born way smaller and earlier than we expected so we needed some preemie clothes as soon as possible. This outfit is absolutely adorable but after just one (just one unbuttoning for a diaper change) the snaps fell out of the onesie. It’s not surprising since the snaps are just plastic. Cute for some photos but not practical for wear.
2.0,Super tiny with zero sparkle :(
2.0,The knots came untied 1 week after i put it on. This product is cheap and unreliable.
2.0,"Came with stain, bad hemming, and cheap material..."
2.0,"Not what i expected. I was looking for a lightweight, compact jacket for travel. In terms of size and weight,  this jacket is more akin to the shell of a winter coat. The fabric is rather heavy weight. It is boxy. It also has a very, very, cheap zipper. It has velcro around the armholes to tighten them, however the velcro placement is such that one can't close them much to even matter. I'll shove the jacket in the car, just in case I need it. But, it is not something that I'll look forward to using, unless I'm caught in an unexpected downpour."
2.0,"This dress fit just the way it was supposed to and the color was spot on, but it was NOT COTTON!"
2.0,Doesn't look like in the picture
2.0,One of the snaps came apart and doesn't work. Was super cute but she cant even wear it.
2.0,"My original jimmy choo Heels got stolen so I was looking for something similar but cheaper version , The original pair they fit better and I didn’t have  blisters on my small toes And on the top of my foot when I wear them but these did , Otherwise they look alike just put Band-Aid before you wear them and get half size bigger then you’re size and u r good to go."
2.0,See through. I returned it
2.0,Uglier in person. Cat looks evil..<br />It's a thick sturdy ring tho..
2.0,Too fitted in the chest. For average or smaller chested women should be fine. Too tight for me being a bit larger up top
2.0,Size was correct but bands on flip flops were stretched out.
2.0,"I am usually a small/medium...This particular item runs small so make sure to go a size up. The lacy part on the top as well as the skirt wears out almost instantly, other then that it is flattering but would not recommend sue to the lace."
2.0,We purchased two and the stitching is off on one. Both disappoint because they do not close with even a single passport and practically explode when cards are added.  Two stars because it is easy to get everything in (i.e. roomy card clots) and I am hoping that over time the leather stretches to allow the wallet to close properly.  How did it get so many positive reviews???
2.0,plastic not really something an adult would wear. it wasn't expensive and no shiping charge so I gave it to my grand daughter to play with.
2.0,"Disappointed that the colored glass is actually clear on the front and black on the back with the actual colors of the design embedded in the middle. So it only looks good when seen from the very front. In addition, the 925 sterling silver, which is the earring hook is so thin and flimsy that I had to remove it and replace with a real sterling silver earring hook. It's really not worth the price I paid, but the design and colors go with a necklace I already had."
2.0,Beautiful material but only a very skinny girl would look good in this dress look s like your wearing a trash bag does not hang well
2.0,Did not like the material or how the shirt fit. Returned it.
2.0,"Pretty, but too delicate. Arrived broken. Returned."
2.0,It fits and it's nice.<br />But had a zipper problem and I lost my glasses.<br />I'm thinking about returning.
2.0,Is a little short and I thought it was cute but I wore it ONCE washed it ONCE and it got holes in it!! Pretty cheap.
2.0,"This shirt is extremely thin. It will be a great summer shirt but you can see through it. You may want to wear a layer. It runs smaller than I was expecting. I was a Large and it fits like a smaller fitted medium. It will do what I needed it to do for a specific color but I could not wear it with leggings like I was hoping. If you buy this, size it up big if you are a little on the fluffy side."
2.0,Very cheap. Backs do not stay on and they are discolored. The rose gold pair do not match each other. I was hoping for something a little bit more stable but I was wrong.
2.0,"Loved the fit, look, and comfort. Unfortunately it was SO LOUD when I walked that I would be embarrassed to wear it in public. I suppose if you're in a loud nightclub or something then it wouldn't matter, but I'm returning mine."
2.0,Cheaply made. Decent for a night of costume wear.
2.0,"I did not like the bottom part of this mask. It covered the majority of my upper back and chest, and the hood was way too big. I did return the product because if this."
2.0,"Is not at described not the color shown nor the texture I didn’t like it, and I hate to return stuff so it’s just there"
2.0,Nice top. Sizing sucks. Runs very small.
2.0,The product looks nothing like the picture advertised. The print is very enlarged.
2.0,No venia completo  y los mios venias de mala calidad
2.0,"It was too long, too tight, and the part that folds over the shoulders never folded quite right. Plus the fabric was cheap feeling."
2.0,It's too small. Order it at least a size or two bigger than you would expect
2.0,They shredded after 2 weeks. Touch screen abilities are rad though.
2.0,It took about 3 weeks to receive this skirt but since then I have searched for prime and ordered different skirts that arrived within 3-5 days. I Will NOT be ordering from China Again..... The skirt fits okay and it is still in my CLOSET!!!
2.0,Needed a true button up sleeveless top...it's not.
2.0,"Watch feels very cheap.  When you handle it the way the metal sounds cheap.  I have had it maybe a month and the paint is already rubbing off where my hand rest on my desk.  Besides that it stays true, doesn't run slow or fast.  You get what you pay for."
2.0,The product was nice initially... Then not even a week into owning and wearing them all of the black rings fell off the product.
2.0,Love the colors. Tiny.
2.0,"I bought the tank. I liked it when I took it out of the package, but then I tried it on. It looked like I was wearing a tent. It hangs to my mid-thigh, flares out, and just looks ridiculous on me. It's a size small, but it fits like a large. I'm petite, but small tanks almost always fit me well. Since it's already the smallest size they have available, I'll have to return for a refund, which is disappointing. I was looking forward to wearing this."
2.0,CUTE!! but way too small!  it fits my pinky but not my toe!
2.0,"I liked the band, seemed much like the one I was replacing from a different vendor, however the metal loops in the mesh very quickly began to separate just enough to snag clothing.....frequently.  No bueno."
2.0,"This dress looked cute in the stock photo, but the actual item was very cheap looking and thin. I was very disappointed."
2.0,Very poor quality my husband has had the solid color bands and they are great. I thought it would be nice to get him something different bad idea this one is poorly made the gray stripe is not straight looks defective line isn’t consistent ring not smooth. I expected better quality.
2.0,"The cotton fabric is cheap. Ordered same color as pictured size small.  Between light sky blue and baby blue. Sleeve really much shorter than shown on  image, and the dress cut is a straight tube with no curves. The off shoulder band as you move slides up.. not impressed."
2.0,They width between the torso and up is too short.  I wanted mine to be a little bloused over at the waist but it pulled if I stood up.  Not that flattering.
2.0,"I wear a size 8 or 10, 5'3&#34;, and found the robe skimpy.  The fabric is soft but is not bamboo--it is rayon.  If you are small in the hips and bust, the robe will probably fit fine.  If you are not slimt, I recommend you look for another robe.  I wish I had returned it."
2.0,"I am returning this. Ordered Kelly green and it is more like teal in person. I needed Kelly green for a costume. The fit definitely runs small; I am 5’2” and usually wear medium, but reading the reviews, I ordered an XL and it fits me perfectly, even the length. I don’t wear XL in any other brand, so be sure to buy two sizes up."
2.0,Doesn't even look lik the real deal.  Very cheaply made.
2.0,The lanyard does not hold. There are gaps on the plastic parts and it does not hold a mask
2.0,"I love the color and the material, however this dress runs large, I'm 5'3 150lbs and I order a medium. I wish it was more fitted are the breast area and my waist."
2.0,"This would be ok for a Halloween party.  The mask is very small, cheaply made."
2.0,"I'm just so sad. I had high hopes for this swimsuit based off of reviews. The bottoms fit amazing, but the top was so flimsy and didn't hold anything in or give any support. I'm a size 42DD, so I was hoping for something better."
2.0,Bows hot glued on and came off in the first wash
2.0,"These are large and inexpensive looking .... but I got what I paid for, went cheap and unfortunately these aren't for me"
2.0,Im an nurse. Don't feel any difference after wearing these. Don't recommend
2.0,"Excellent when you use for the first time,BUT after a first wash the shirt looks like its 3years old . I wouldnt recomend .."
2.0,"It's cute online but it seemed a litttle cheap looking in person imo, the length wasn't long enough for me,  it hung at an awkward length.  I ended up returning."
2.0,I bought these for my daughter and she said they were quite flimsy and she would not recommend them to anyone.
2.0,Product was beautiful initially but began to turn dark and tarnish after only wearing once.
2.0,Way to small for the size
2.0,flimsy and very cheap looking. Dont buy this. It fits awkward and it looks like a place setter for a dinner table than an actual dress. it also feels like you're wearing a place setter.
2.0,"It's just a tight T shirt.  In my opinion, a waste of money for back support"
2.0,"The fabric was nice and thick but the sizing of the upper portion was simply too large, and the chunky buttons ended up looking cheap in-person. Looked more like children's clothing than a dress intended for adults. The sizing may be more appropriate for those with long torsos."
2.0,theyre super cute but break way too easy
2.0,These are cute but the pattern presses into my leg in an uncomfortable way. I just don't love wearing them and I wouldn't buy them again.
2.0,I liked the product and it was very cute but it was just too small and very very short.
2.0,I ordered black but after washed it is now a gray color.
2.0,This was very cute however the Donald duck stamp you could barely see it looked very cheap not worth the price I paid for it should’ve been more like 3or4$
2.0,This should be made to fit. The dress fits more like a lace shirt. The coat is too high on my waist making it fall in an unflattering way. The button should be more secure also.
2.0,the watch band didn't come with pins oh well nice sirprize
2.0,I would like it if it had fit but it was too small.
2.0,cheap material and very thin will not recommend
2.0,"The zipper falls down a lot, and is not as supportive as I would have hoped. Fit is good, but not my best investment."
2.0,Very cute but sweatshirt does not fit comfortably at the bottom.  Very tight at the bottom of the shirt
2.0,These weren't very durable. They looked nice to begin with but turned green around the stones after a few weeks.
2.0,My daughter wore this for the first time tonight and the ribbon on the tutu had already torn from the fabric. So frustrating as I cannot return it and wasted money..... it was the best fitting and leotard part was great quality! But the skirt is not.
2.0,"Poor quality. Wore them on a walk for less than hour and they started to unravel.  The packaging was really nice, though."
2.0,"don't waste your money, with the edge phone the center of the protector does not even touch the phone, difficult to text or use the apps"
2.0,Started to unravel as soon as we took it out of the box.
2.0,it didn't cost much... the fabric was cheap... not a great buy
2.0,"Was looking for button back shirt or sweater, this was only solid color option I could find. It’s a lot more casual then I expected. Thin stiff T-shirt material. Will probably keep since it was so inexpensive but not good enough to where for a night out, stitching around neck arrived with string already pulling & stitching around shoulders isn’t even. Also, buttons start at very top & end too high up in my opinion, careful when pulling on/off as it will catch your hair."
2.0,"I wanted warmer sweats to walk the dogs in during the winter in Montana. These fit so badly, that even though they are warm, I can only wear them for 10 - 15 minutes at a time. They are much too small in the hips/thighs. It's in the negatives here (-17 right now) and they keep my legs warm, but the fit is the absolute worst. I wouldn't buy them again."
2.0,They didn't help a lot with the brightness of headlights
2.0,"I haven't been able to wear them yet because I want to wear the large pearl on the front of my lobe.  The stud for the big one has to go in through the back of the ear lobe.  I have never had earrings like this.  When I have time I will practice, and maybe I can do it.  Otherwise, I have wasted my money."
2.0,EXTREMELY thin. You can see thru the material.  Not even sure I can wear them without others seeing thru them too. smh
2.0,"I'm a waist size 26-27, so I chose the size 4 because that's the size the chart recommends. These pants were ENORMOUS. Way too big and baggy and really unflattering. I was super disappointed when I put them on."
2.0,"I love the look but will have to return these. I'm a 6-6.5, ordered 6.5 M and they are quite tight. I have another 6.5 M pair of this brand that are super comfortable, so I'm very disappointed."
2.0,Fit was not right for someone my height 5’11
2.0,"These socks were the perfect red, but after one wash they shrank and that was the end of the good fit(size10)."
2.0,You need an absolutely gigantic head for this to fit remotely well
2.0,"This fits nice, but it pills very easily around the neck and down the front. Didn’t wear it very many times before it did this. It looks worn out now!"
2.0,Pattern looks cheap and runs large
2.0,"I have several LJ bracelets and this did not have the same quality. It look cheap, ordinary and flimsy. Not worth the money."
2.0,"The color of the earrings and the color of the necklace don't match. if I would have seen these in a store I would not have bought them as a set. They were bought for my 14 year old daughter and she doesn't seem to mind, but if they were for me I would've returned them."
2.0,"First of all, it was weeks before I received these from the slow boat from China and then some of them were extremely small.  Like for a kid."
2.0,"The design is beautiful, but the gold paint irritated my skin right away. Would not recommend if you have sensitive skin."
2.0,Supposed to be 12 different colors but I received 2 each of 6 colors-- not what I needed or wanted. Description says 100% cotton but the features describe them as 100 % polyester. Not worth 2 month wait to return and hope for better luck.
2.0,"Review of Molemsx Rain Coat (1-2 Pack) EVA Rain Poncho for Women and Men, Hooded Reusable Long Raincoat<br /><br />Despite being advertised as a two pack this only contained only one.<br /><br />Intent was to be able to store these in my vehicle for emergency purposes.<br /><br />These would work but are extremely undersized.  In American sizes I doubt that anyone greater than men’s size Large.  The product description states up to XL but I really think that is European sizing.<br /><br />The material is very light weight and design would also cover down to knees so would be suitable for use except for the sizing problem and not being as advertised."
2.0,Do not like this top a all.Way too big but just does not fit correctly.
2.0,Color ran off on its own in weeks. I think its run off from rubbing on skin. Not a good purchase.
2.0,Fit was good but poorly made. Romper ripped on side first time wearing it.
2.0,"When you put it on, it is hard to adjust and leaves finger prints which are hard to get off. Doesn’t have a classy look. Will probably not wear it."
2.0,"This item was supposed to be an extra large.  I do not wear an extra large.  I bought it as a ""nightgown"".  I wear a large medium, so, knowing that Chinese makers of women's clothing have not a clue as to what size fits women in the US, I bought a larger size.  I do not know in what universe this is supposed to be an extra large, but it did not fit in the bust or the waist.  I gave it to someone who wears a size four and she said that it was ""OK"" in size, but not really comfortable.  When will I ever learn?  I have yet to find ANY clothing item, made in China and sold online that remotely comes close to the size it is supposed to be."
2.0,Doesn't really do a good job on night sweats. 100% bamboo pajamas do a much better job.
2.0,BUY 2 PAIR AND USE DOUBLE MAGNETS TO MAKE IT WORK.
2.0,Too small and frames are dark
2.0,These have been nothing but trouble. Clips always come loose
2.0,"Not what I expected, I ordered an XL and it looks like a medium. Flimsy and very see through. Not a dress at all more like lingerie be ware."
2.0,very small order  2 or 3 sizes up if you want to have any wear time.  Washed it and shrunk a size plus they were small sized to start with.<br />What happened to Amazon having quality clothing? They came from China looks like it came from WISH site just through Amazon.  Not impressed!
2.0,I had to return two pairs of these they kept breaking when you lace up the boot. they are comfortable but quality is bad
2.0,I do not buy them again
2.0,Runs small. Runs about 1 to 2 sizes small. Bought 2xl fits more like a xl.
2.0,"The shoes themselves seem decent, but my critique is about the straps.  The quality of the velcro is not very strong and not what I expected from something that needs to keep the shoe on the foot of a small child.  On top of that, the surface area of the velcro is not large so, even if it were higher quality, there's just not that much of it to stick together.  Honestly, I expected better, even from a $15 shoe."
2.0,"I’m normally a small/medium depending on the brand.  I ordered a medium and it was huge - like a big, baggy tank top.  Definitely size way down.  Was a cute style but it’s going back!"
2.0,Not what I thought. I didn’t expect there to be rubber grips on the bottom of the socks as well. This make sit hard to skip in to certain styles of shoes. No photos of the bottom grips are included in the listing.
2.0,Meh. Thicker material than pictured. More fitted and clingy than pictured despite sizing up. I am 5'4&#34; 125 and ordered a medium.
2.0,Item does not stay snug in my frame... I may glue the lens in but what a pain...
2.0,There was a toxic rubber/plastic smell as soon as I opened the bag. This was disappointing as the slippers fit well and it light. It looks cheap. I guess I need to stick with the better brands. I do not recommend these.
2.0,The bar is a lil on the small side so if you have a thicker nipple like I do can’t use them. :(
2.0,"These seemed like almost indestructible luggage tags when I bought them over a year ago.  After putting them on all our luggage and using them for over a year now we're pretty unhappy with them and their durability.  The problem is with the wire cord and fastener.  3 of them have had the wire fastener come apart -- not the end that screws together, but the end that is supposed to be permanently connected.  In the process of replacing them all now with something different and more durable."
2.0,It defeats the purpose of getting a blouse for the heat of the summer if you have to layer it up because it's see through.  There is a panel under the embroidery that looks like a bib because it's visible through the shirt.
2.0,Great material but SUPER TIGHT!!  I even ordered a size bigger
2.0,"This product did not stay put after applying.  After 5 minutes, the bra was already coming off of my skin."
2.0,Would prefer the actual connecting piece to grip more tightly.
2.0,"Wore this once and the fringe keeps falling out!!!!...Everywhere I go there is a trail.. :(<br />NOT HAPPY AT ALL.... The shape is a little odd to...the shoulders are wide..the neck is super large and the rest fits more like a regular med/lg...<br />Just weird.... My advice is ,,,, save your dime..."
2.0,Not a great quality. I ended up returning it. The fabric on the skirt was thin and looked much better on the photo than in person.
2.0,The dress is beautiful but the extra fabric by the boob WILL give everyone a peep show. This is probably better for a flat-chested person. someone at the party got a nip view a few times.
2.0,Too big & too long. I'm 5'1 & it went all the way to the floor.
2.0,"I bought XL, but they fit my daughter who wears a SM."
2.0,Stones were missing on necklace
2.0,Larger than should be.
2.0,"i got this ring so people wouldn't ""hit"" on me. i received it the first day it was expected and it came in a really cute box. i put it on immediately and wore it to work. i've had it for about three days now and i noticed it was fitting really weird. i took it off and its shape was completely distorted. it bends very easily. i took it off and put it on my key ring. i should have known better, because its so cheap. its really pretty, but only for about a night. then it bends like it was made from aluminum foil."
2.0,"They seemed great, kids loved the cute animals and appearance was good. After a week of use, they had all frayed and elastic had thinned and then snapped away from the clasps. If not for that problem, they would have been just what we were looking for."
2.0,Material was not what I expected
2.0,"Picture this... I slide into my homemade, lovingly crafted spandex Thor costume en route to the biggest Halloween party of the year. I had spent the previous 3 years painstakingly growing my hair, and (against my gut instinct) dyed my hair blonde. Truly, I was the son of Odin.<br /><br />I only needed one prop. One prop to tie the whole thing together. The very hammer you are reading about as I speak.<br /><br />When it arrived in the mail, I must say... For the price, the look and authenticity was on point. But after a few beers, I had BARELY beaten 17 people upon the head and shoulders, before it folded like a deck of cards. SURELY this is not the hammer of the thunder god. If it can't withstand a couple hundred well intentioned clobberings, then it shouldn't have Thor's name stamped on it.<br /><br />But seriously. This thing breaks really easily."
2.0,I really like the shirt but it’s too small. I ordered a 2xl because that’s what I normally wear but this shirt fits like a large. It’s way too small.
2.0,No stretch. Very tight. Not elasticy at all. First pair never showed up.
2.0,Glasses came on time...BUT I had to adjust one of the arms because it was loopsided. The frames are cheap and huge! I have a nice size head and they were waaay to big. Sorry...Wasn't impressed.
2.0,"I got last minute for a convention but ultimately couldn't use it. I originally ordered a medium since that's what the size chart said would fit and the pants would not even go over my knees. I figured I should just try a size bigger but then got it a few days later to find that the pants still did not fit. Very disappointing.<br /><br />When I ordered the second time with the large, I had an arm belt missing as well, along with the poorly glued on buckles on the belt falling off. Wirth both sets of gloves, the little studs on the gloves fell off right after being taken out of the package, having strings of hot glue on them. I doubt I could even wear them to the convention, since trying them once had nearly all of the studs fall off. I will say that the top is fairly nice, although the details are fairly small compared to Jinx's actual top.<br /><br />While it's not a very expensive costume, I'm sure you can find something of better quality near the same price elsewhere. Especially one that actually fits and isn't hot glued together. Hope this helps"
2.0,"The top is so cute, thin material, fits perfect.<br />The bottoms fit super weird. Way to lose in the butt and croch. The legs are way to narrow and tight."
2.0,Quality was okay but it was fully fitted with no opening in the back so scratchy material hurt my daughter trying to get it on.
2.0,"I have been wearing non-magnifying wrap-arounds for several years, so this seemed like a logical choice for improved distance vision plus sun protection.  But the temples on these are much wider (top to bottom) and block more peripheral vision than I expected.  I felt quite uncomfortable driving with these and not being able to see my periphery.<br /><br />Instead, I am happier with the following, which appears to be from the same original manufacturer.  The stamps on the inside of the temples are similar, as is the feel of the plastic.  I've been using these daily for 6 months with no complaints:<br /><br />In Style Eyes InSight, Classic Full Reader Sunglasses. Not Bifocals"
2.0,Not high quality inside of purses really cheap crackling material
2.0,"It was much shorter than expected. I bought a large, I would’ve been more pleased with this product if it had thicker fabric. You can see any bra right through it. It is also not flattering for an hourglass figure."
2.0,Too tight on top too loose on bottoms I’m usually a small but ordered a medium. The fabric is shiny and cheap and the print is a completely different scale and color print
2.0,Cheap ugly polyester material and poor stitching. You'd be better off spending money on that wish app.
2.0,"seemed cheap quality, some were ok but the rest I gave away"
2.0,Broke first ti e I wore
2.0,Not at all what I expected. Fabric too thin. Dress way long but i was ok with that. Sizing too big. Color was off. Not ivory. I had to return bc i would never wear.
2.0,"Was looking to buy a cheaper pair rather than the Jeffrey Campbell look-alikes, but these feel cheap, smell cheap. The color is not really beige, its more yellow-ish?"
2.0,The fit was spot on. I love the concept/design. My only complaint was that the red sweatshirt coloring bled through and made the white “K” slightly pink. Not sure how I’ll fix it yet-it’s a screen printing issue with the colors so a reorder won’t help.
2.0,"Dress could have been just ok if only the lining didn’t cut right across the chest. Revealed way more than I was comfortable with. Returned.<br /><br />Update: The company that sells this dress (Zesica) contacted me and promised to send a free dress if I’d take my review down. Of course they haven’t followed though, not that I expected it and I stand behind my review. I DO NOT recommend this dress."
2.0,It was pretty but not for ladies with wide hips. Brings major attention to them. Cut very small. Got it on and thought I'd have to cut it to get out of it.
2.0,"If you’re looking for the kimono shown in pics, don’t buy this product. It’s a cheap imitation. The sleeves are not oversized, the fit is snug, the fabric is cheap and the belt doesn’t really do anything. I’m returning it and investing on a name brand."
2.0,"Check first before you decide to keep or return.To start the necklace I received look like a cheap imitation then from the picture though granted it was a Stargate pendant and chain look very similar to the one in the picture but it wasn't the same one, someone had dropped the ball like someone grabbed it off a shelf and decided to ship it out. but the one I did get it wasn't to terrible I did however have to replace it with a different chain, personal reasons, and I the thing that's between the chain and pendant it's a little big but I've been working with it I should've realize this sooner but I will not be buying this again"
2.0,"These socks actually are fantastic.  But, I only received 5 socks.  When my order arrived my red blue and white colored &#34;pair&#34; had one sock missing.  Very frustrating.  Otherwise no complaints on the product itself"
2.0,"The ""stones"" fell off almost immediately."
2.0,Love everything other than the color or design wears off. Very disappointing.
2.0,If pictures speak a thousand words then here are a few.  Even the free pouch was defective. The materials the pack is made of are decent but the stitching is not. Just like all other none brand name packs.
2.0,Go up two sizes if you want them to fit.
2.0,Nearly lost my whole watch + discoloration
2.0,Not as described looks CHEAP run very small!!!
2.0,Its HUGE on my small wrists.
2.0,It was the right size but after an hour or so it doesn’t want to stay in place any longer
2.0,"They're cute at first, but stretch out and sag down"
2.0,The dress is adorable but the material is so thin and very wrinkly. I definitely don’t want clothing that I have to iron so this was a no go for me. The light pink is a beautiful color and it is a very comfy dress. I had really hoped it would work out.
2.0,"They fit ok there's a side zipper and no give in the material. I wore once to work and the buttons were bulky and not seen on very well, I noticed half way through my shift a button fell off. There was no way to fix this so I had to remove the other buttons☹️"
2.0,These were too big for my 3.5 year old daughter's head.
2.0,"Size is more for a child, not an audit"
2.0,"Sadly, this adorable kitty w her mouse toy looks cute in this picture but when it arrived, it is kinda blurred and I can't make out any of these features I just described in the picture. Don't recommend this charm. So sorry."
2.0,Came unhooked right away and already lost 2 of them. Not impressed
2.0,one of the handles broke after only a month of having it
2.0,"I dont use them because they feel very uncomfortable.  They are not small, but they feel like if they were."
2.0,Skirt was extremely small
2.0,"Chain came broken, never had a chance to wear it"
2.0,Didn't like it on my frame. It looks great on others. Just didn't like for me. But I never returned it. So it's sitting in my closet. Maybe I'll give it away.
2.0,The dress fits but the ruffle at the neck is very outdated and unflattering. The hem is very uneven - long enough to step on with my left foot and showing my right ankle. I will be returning this item.
2.0,The robe held up beautifully in the washing machine and dryer. It came out soft but alas it is sized too small. I will be gifting this one to my sister and ordering another for myself.
2.0,"I finally got this loaded with pertinent things & after using for less than a week, the strap broke at rivet. I also discovered that it is kind of hard to find things in the 2-zipper compartments (may be just a thing for me).  Since I can't return, I wanted to let people know prior to buying.  I wouldn't buy this item."
2.0,Being returned.  Beyond small.  Barely fits one bra
2.0,"Absolute waste of money, lights in the jacket were very poor.. just basically a string of cheap lights poorly attached not happy at all with the quality of the product for the price.."
2.0,"I really liked the item. The inscription Was well engraved. The stainless steel was Really strong. In fact it was too strong the bracelet keeps falling off my arm and I can't squeeze it any tighter<br /> because it's Too strong to bend to fit my wrist better, So I can't wear it."
2.0,Lovely little dress just wish it came in an XL size which is generally 18 or 20
2.0,"It was like wearing a tent. I went off my measurements and everything, but this shirt was HUGE."
2.0,Put them on and could not pull over my cock pouch for little people not men
2.0,"Arm holes were too small.  Was not cost effective to return, so I removed the sleeves to make it roomier."
2.0,THEY SIT SO CLOSE TO MY FACE AND EYES THAT THEY GET STEAMED UP JUST WALKING TO MY CAR.
2.0,"Was really heavy, was really difficult to try to bend it to fit my extremely small wrists. Also, the product left stains on my wrists. If you are allergic to nickel DO NOT buy this bracelet. It says pure copper but no where in the description does it say it was nickle plated."
2.0,Looked down during a restroom break & the top ball was missing on the 2nd day…..
2.0,A disappointment I must say.. Got the wrong size to begin with so got a second one that got me better but its buckle broke and I was forced to go back to the original one that's too tight but still works... Maybe it's my body type but my experience with this product hasn't been a very happy one..
2.0,"These run very small.<br /><br />Women’s large is smaller than a child’s 14/16. The photo is of the shorts I bought for myself (I wear a women’s 12/14 and got a large) over top of my ten year old’s child’s XL 14/16 and as you can see, the women’s shorts are smaller than the child’s size.<br /><br />Pretty cute and bonus for pockets, but unless you are petite, these just aren’t for you!"
2.0,Weird details on the back. It also makes me look fat
2.0,Cute necklace. But came broken. There's no way to fix it either. Definitely cheaply made.
2.0,Not worth the money. Too big. Stuffing come out of the pocket. It’s upsrtting.
2.0,Khaki plain?  Try diarrhea brown.
2.0,"I returned it...it looked nice in the pic, but in person looked like seatbelt material"
2.0,Couldn't fit into ear. Multiple people tried. Decent quality.
2.0,"The suit was too small, I returned it once, came back to me a few weeks later. I took it back to ups for a second time last week. I need to see a refund this time"
2.0,"Didn’t like the quality of this dress. I purchased in the pink and it was see through. Also it ran tight in the shoulders and chest. For being larger chested, it didn’t work. Material was very thin. Wouldn’t recommend."
2.0,"I couldn't wait to get this dress to wear for a summer cookout. I got it on time, only it didn't have pockets. So  bummed. Sending it back and buying the same in another dress that confirmed it has pockets."
2.0,"Its a nice big purse, but EXTREMELY HEAVY.  I didn't weigh it empty, but can only imagine how heavy it would be loaded up.  I ignored the comments about the weight,  as I liked other comments I read.  Desperate for a new purse and being past midnight, I hit the order button. Yada Yada Yada, it's been sent back and I ordered a Dooney & Burke.  Not arrived yet, but reviews are great.  We'll see....."
2.0,It would of been nice if the writing on it came off.
2.0,It was a weird cheap jersey material and I did not expect that
2.0,"The neck size didn't tell me that the shirt size was going to be a 3XL; it just gave me the neck size.  My husband has a large neck, but smaller waist. His neck is apparently a 3XL and his body is a 2XL.  It was also too short for a 3XL shirt. I was disappointed that the shirt wasn't made well."
2.0,Neck line is huge. You could easily fit a watermelon thru the head hole. Sideways.
2.0,Beautiful when received them but i put the cover in my purse and when i took it out the sunglasses were broken. Very fragile.
2.0,I was looking forward to using this purse to travel with but 4 days into my vacation I noticed the lining between the large outside pocket and the purse interior had completely torn away. I was quite disappointed at the poor quality of the lining.  Otherwise it's a nice bag and a good size.
2.0,I thought it would be as long as the picture shows but it sits at my waist.  Not returning but not what I expected.
2.0,They were great until two weeks in...they faded. 😔
2.0,Not bad for the price. Very tight on the finger. ..
2.0,Like the high waist.  Fabric feels cheap and attracts lint.
2.0,"I planned on not wearing a bra with this, but it's so thin & sheer that you can even see the outline of my areola."
2.0,Shirt looks and feels great. But after the second wash. The picture started to crack. Washed as directed.
2.0,this item will not stay in position...junk
2.0,I was expecting better quality :(
2.0,"Looks amazing, but the second I tried to pull off the string that it came with, it broke in half.<br />I really wanted to wear this to piss off the Walmart greeter that takes covid way too seriously."
2.0,This bra had so much potential if only I was able to select a size. One size fits most for a bra just isn’t practical. I am petite and it felt very restricting! The material and style were nice however
2.0,"Glasses look great -- even expensive, BUT, the lense quality is extremely poor! Shades are so dark it is like putting on a blindfold. So, unless you are planning a trip to the sun, don't count on being able to wear these very often -- especially when driving. I could not even see my dashboard control panel (esp. speedometer) while wearing these!"
2.0,Extremely small and somewhat flimsy making it extra hard to put in. I find it hard to believe it's a true16. I was disappointed. The best thing I can say is that they are very pretty.
2.0,ADOREABLE but after one was the shorts were shredded
2.0,I’m surprised there were so many good reviews on this product. It does not look like the picture. It looks cheap and feels cheap. Also shorter than the picture showed.
2.0,"I wanted to love this dress.  I really did.  However once i slipped this on, i immediately noticed the hip area appeared to have ""saddlebags"". Also, the length hit above the knee (Im 5'8).  The top/chest area was amazing (44D).  But it would cost too much in alterations to fix the hips/length.  Will be returning."
2.0,"doesn't work, advised by company to change battery,"
2.0,I couldn't find this umbrella anywhere. Ordered it for my niece by the 2nd use it was broken. Quality not good. I bought a Paw Patrol one at Party City for half the price & it still works like new.
2.0,It doesn't fit like the picture it is to short it opens on the front. It doesn't cover the waist and shows your belly button
2.0,"Text font is small, the chain is big"
2.0,"Pretty, but looks nothing like the picture which makes it appear gauzy and stretchy. Pretty, but it’s not what I was looking for."
2.0,"There’s a significant gap where the band attached to the watch. It’s pretty wiggly too, so I will be returning this."
2.0,"It was adorable on. I wore it as a top with leggings and a cami under it. However the first washing it totally fell apart. The entire hem turned into Charlotte's Web...without the cool talking animals. I'm returning it. You can't see the whole shirt on me in this pic but I think you can see it fits well. I'm a 38 D and large top/size 16 bottom. Fit well even over hips. The only thing I can say is that if you were to hand wash it, maybe that would work. Shame because I really did like it."
2.0,"This product is not 95% cotton, it's very synthetic. The stitching is large, so I would be afraid to wash that it would become easily unravelled. Also, the color is not navy, it's more of a neon royal blue. Product was returned."
2.0,fast shipping. not what i  was expecting.different look when i got them
2.0,Shoes were too big for daughter
2.0,"Wrinkles far too quickly.  Just sitting in a car for five minutes you will have creases all over.  Poor quality, very lightweight."
2.0,Bought these socks for my wife and 3 daughters as they are all abid Disney fans. Socks advertised as ladies but upon receipt could tell they too small. Mot sure they would have fit teenage granddaughters. Returned socks same day. Amazon great with timely refund of my cost. Thank you Anazon.
2.0,It broke the second time I wore it
2.0,The shorts are terrible. And the shirt is very small.
2.0,The material is a weird synthetic blend but on the model it looks like a cotton knit. I guess I bought a brand new sleep shirt because I wouldn't be out in public with this shirt on
2.0,Cheap material.  Will use it for in house only
2.0,"Received these as a gift.  I was really excited about them, but they are way too small.  I wear a size 10.5 in American sizes.  The description says that the socks fit up to size 11.  Not even close.  I would consider them to be child sizes.  They’re also very thin."
2.0,I wear a small Apple Watch and I got this one in small and it didn’t fit.
2.0,I had to repair the clasp
2.0,Not as shown.
2.0,"The problem with the pants is that I cant tell which is the front or the back, they fit horrible  for the amount of money that I spent on them, very poor quality material."
2.0,"I really like the color of these but the sizing was just so off. I got a medium (I'm a size 4 in pants) and the waist was tight but the legs were really baggy. The material was really nice and the color was great, but  returning due to the size.<br /><br />The seam at the waist is not my favorite - definitely cuts in to your stomach."
2.0,This bags has an expensive look. The colour and the material are very nice but the zippers are crap. After a few weeks of using the bag the zippers are malfunctioning. Also the black rubber trimming on the handles have all peeled away leaving the handles looking unfinished.My initial excitement has quickly changed to very disappointed.
2.0,Too small even for my small male adult head. These are for kids.
2.0,Feels cheaper than what I paid sent back
2.0,"Assumed fixture on this was going to be one of those ""tack-type things that you push"".  Fixture turned out to be a typical pin clasp - a very small clasp that is not only hard to manipulate, but will not open to expose a space to undo the pin.  Cosmetically, the pin is cute with rhinestones intact and a decent 1"" size (I ordered the large)."
2.0,"The shoes were pretty but apparently not very good quality.  Although I am a size 7-1/2, these shoes did not fit.  I would've normally just returned them for a larger size, but what I found alarming was that one shoe was bigger than the other and not cushiony and comfortable on the inside.  For the price, it couldn't been better made."
2.0,"The pattern on the black and white bandana bleed in the print...not clean.<br />Material is thin, much thinner than I was expecting."
2.0,"This bag, while good in concept is lacking in delivery!!!  The wheels are too small, and very close together. Any time you take a turn (say around a corner), hit even the smallest of bumps, or even sneeze while walking the bag tips to the side.<br />This bag is advertised as a laptop wheeled/backpack for college use: Unfortunately, it is FAR from that.  I carry two 1 inch binders, my laptop, and the bag is stuffed.<br /><br />The bag doesn't do a good job with the weight management as a backpack, so it is cumbersome to wear and uncomfortable.  In the wheeled configuration, it tips and wobbles constantly when I am on anything but the smoothest of floors.  Even then, I sound like the 4:15 freight train coming through with a heavy load!!!<br /><br />I would  recommend anyone wanting a wheeled backpack for ACTUAL school to look elsewhere!!"
2.0,The jacket wasn't what I expected. Fits like a mid-drift top. Smelled horrible so I washed it.....when it came out of the dryer there were pieces of thread hanging everywhere. Arms were a good length.
2.0,"Poor quality, itchy fabric, poorly constructed."
2.0,bought XXL.........way too small and very short. Nice undershirt just way too small and not long enough.I would suggest getting  2 sizes bigger than usual. I buy XL in shirts and to be safe I ordered XXL and it's still way small.
2.0,"I bought 1 earlier this week and absolutely loved the fit and length!!!  So I ordered 2 more, I got one yesterday and as seen in the photo it is 4 inches shorter than the first. Today I got the navy one, and it is 2 inches longer than the second one.  Not sure what is wrong with who is cutting the material? But would like  continuity with all!!"
2.0,"The quality looks good on these tank tops, but I ordered a 3x and they fit like an XL or 1x. I expected snug so that I could layer, but these are way beyond snug."
2.0,"It looks like it was printed on and after 1 week having having it, it has started to peel"
2.0,"Item looks great when you receive it, but use it a few times and well the aluminum is so thin and flimsy it bends out of shape from very light usage. About three trips in and these are all bent out of shape and beat up looking. Stay away until you see something similar made of metal and not the equivalent of Reynolds Wrap."
2.0,"Don't buy it!  I am a long time fan of UD and their water bottles. I'm not sure if the older style was is available or whether the new cap/spout are a new design replacing the old - regardless; this design is poorly thought out at best.<br /><br />In the midst of a run (particularly if you're racing and not stopping), the spout is tough to pull out with your teeth. Within a week, the top part of the spout separated from body of the cap - mid run.<br /><br />If you don't wind up biting yourself trying to get spout to extend, you'll end up pulling it loose from the base rendering the whole thing inop  (unless you want to stop and unscrew the cap every time)"
2.0,"Fast shipping. I was under the impression that I had ordered a sterling paw, however when it arrived the paw is orange. The pictures or description need to reflect this information. I would not have purchased had I known this."
2.0,I really liked the camo look of these masks. The fit was good and they were more comfortable than some masks that I had purchased. Unfortunately one of the ear straps broke within 3 days of wearing it. Returning for a refund
2.0,After using the product for a short period of time the right lens became loose and would not stay up. I began to use the other pair with the same result.
2.0,"My daughter was so excited for these shoes to arrive. I ordered a half size bigger based on the recommendations of others, and she couldn't even get her foot in. Beyond disappointing when she had been looking forward to them to arrive. Additionally, it would have been helpful for some instructions as to the battery life, time to charge etc, instead there was just an adapter to plug it in and you were left on your own to figure it out."
2.0,Falls out easily.  Lost all of them.
2.0,These are not stainless steel. They left the &quot;green ring&quot; in my nose. Super disappointed cause I loved the look of them.
2.0,The inside of the bag had a smell to it. Not sure what it was from.
2.0,These run super small
2.0,Looks just like picture. However ypu can't bend it to fit unless you want to really pry it with plyers. So good luck getting it to stay on.
2.0,Received a pair of Happy Socks a few years back as a gift and they’ve really held up. Was looking for some quality ones with a fun print and ordered these. I love the look but I’m worried about how long they’ll last based on the first wear/wash. The photo is after one wash and you can see some of the threads are already coming loose. I also notice that the socks with patterns fully covering the socks are tighter and more difficult to get on. It seems like the embroidery thread is less stretchy than the rest of the sock. For the price I don’t plan on ordering any more pairs which is a shame because they look great.
2.0,"I ordered this set of boxer shorts before Christmas. I have wore each one at least one time and some a few more times, one of the shorts are already ripping. I hope the seller gets in contact with me and offers a replacement. Disappointed overall."
2.0,I just did not like it on me.
2.0,Expected a bit more. Looks lime a 2 dollar anklet. Returned it and received my money back.
2.0,It's a very pretty piece but apparently not meant to be worn daily. The stone came unglued and fell out in under 2 months.  :(
2.0,That one size fits all don't work on my big head...
2.0,Disappointed in this item. Looks cute online and much less cute in reality. Fits oddly and I hate the material.
2.0,Way smaller than expected - I am an XL - and I ordered XL - too tight
2.0,Color is not like picture. Not brown at all. Reddish with blonde highlights. I shake it and long pieces keep coming out. Took 17 days to recieve. Since i wanted it more brown and certainly not red I'm sure i won't wear it. The cut doesn't look like the picture. Sorry for a negative review but i have to tell the truth of what i ordered and what i got.
2.0,"Beautiful glasses, but just to look at, not through - they fall right off your face.<br />Literally would fall immediately right off my nose after putting on. Returned them."
2.0,Returned. Poorly made. Uneven seams. No shape at all. Really disappointing.
2.0,The fabric is of poor quality. It wrinkles very easily unlike other school uniforms and ends up looking terrible.
2.0,"Not the best quality, but you get what you pay for. The pleats are nonexistent and it came with a black stain (I got the white dress). The smell fresh out of the package was horrendous as others have noted, but it went away with just one gentle wash for me. It looks a bit dingy after washing, but I'm hoping it will be presentable when I have to wear it. I plan to wear a long cardigan to cover the stain."
2.0,"These sunglasses fit very well, are very light and look great without being too ostentatious. The polarization is also good quality and they are not too mirror-like or dark that they impede your sight. The only issue I had: they broke while I had them on my head, walking around a store, after a week of use."
2.0,"Dress was tight in the shoulders, but I am use to that in my clothes.  What I wasn't use to was that the dress fell apart when I washed it the very first time.  When I took it from the wash machine after washing on gentle cycle, there was a great big hole in the area of the smocking."
2.0,Not a true 5 xl it fits like a tight 3xk
2.0,"Although it held up through fairly heavy use, I don't trust it enough to continue using it. The main part of the strap is actually fine, but it's the ends that loop onto the camera that are thin. If you know how to leather work, I'd change them. If you don't want to spend the money on tools and additional leather, then put that money towards a different strap. Again, it held up even though I was running around with it, and I genuinely thought it would have snapped and destroyed my camera, but it didn't, I just don't want to use it long enough for that to happen at all."
2.0,"Material is extremely cheap and the color I recieved is not the same . The picture looks like a deep navy with a burgundy print . I got a thin, purple looking robe ."
2.0,This item fits fine but the material of the romper feels like plastic. I would not buy this item again.
2.0,"After 3 weeks the one touch button fell out...so the watch is somewhat worthless at this point. I am not happy at all. Despite the style  and the feel, this watch was a waste of my money."
2.0,I dislike the material it's scrachy and when my legs rub together you can feel the fabric rubbing against each other.
2.0,"These shoes are not what they look in the picture, the quality of the fabric internal is not good, and outside is average. Won't buy it again."
2.0,Definitely get a size smaller than your regular size. The material is very clingy and static. Not for me
2.0,Purchased based on reviews.  These do not stay on your head.  I’m doing low impact barre and these slip off constantly.<br /><br />They are cute.
2.0,Turns my ears green
2.0,"The ear straps are quite narrow and thus slightly uncomfortable.  More importantly, although it's great that they have a stiffener at the nose bridge it is rather insubstantial, thus doesn't do much to keep a good fit so unfiltered air bypasses the mask and my glasses fog to boot."
2.0,The write up on this belt suggests that the buckle can be removed in the belt can be trimmed but that is patently false. The buckle cannot be adjusted at all because the zipper compartment runs all the way up to the buckle. You can trim the other end of the belt but the trim is sloppy and leaves a lot of rough edges and fabric strands. I would have just sent it back if it was more expensive but I used a lighter to sing the edges of the trimmed part. They still look sloppy but fortunately I didn't buy this belt for dressing up.
2.0,"these pilled all over the outside after the first wash/air dry. they're soft and fit well, but can't be washed in a machine."
2.0,The material was heavy.  The dress wasn't as pretty and flowing as one might imagine from the description and photos
2.0,The XXL I received was what other companies call a Large.
2.0,Non matching but good to be outside or maybe to work in the yard on a windy day.
2.0,"I was not happy overall with this product. The time frame I received it was correct. The way it looks is true to the picture. The description tells you on how to order to your size. And I did just that. With doing that it didn't need any adjusting at all with the strings, which would have been fine, but it was loose in the shoulder area. I misread and thought there would be spiral steel boned. And it says it does have some. Yes two. In the front, no where else. If you are looking to bring in your squishy then those won't be doing anything for you. You need a lot more than 2."
2.0,The material is none stretchy and the measurements where off on their size chart.
2.0,"The waist only comes to my belly button, the legs are short, and the belt is barely long enough to tie a tiny bow. The belt loops are sewn onto the top ruffle part, rather than the waistband so it slides up over the back instead of cinching the waist. Only good thing is the fabric feels nice."
2.0,BE CAREFUL OF SIZING! Thiught I was buying a nose ring ... no way on earth this would begin to fit in my nose. Very disappointed
2.0,"I love the looks and patterns of this shirt.  Runs a bit large.  The main issue I have with this shirt is the sleeves.  With them being different types of material for each pattern, some pieces are stretchy and some are not making the fit weird.  Would not buy again."
2.0,Did not like how they fit and how the clips attached to the shirt.
2.0,when you see the picture of the tie the white polka a dots  they are not white was dispointed
2.0,"Ordered a 3X as I am a ""fluffy"" guy. Order came, fits my 89lb 13 year old perfectly. He normally wears a M. I am a school teacher and our mascot is a Minuteman and I was hoping to wear this to some of the games. Oh well. The image on the hoodie is crisp and nice. It is a good weight for fall/spring. I would send it back, but it has been claimed by the kid."
2.0,"Cute dress and concept--and great Kelly Green color, but the top collar sits back too far making the neckline look big and awkward. Don't do it."
2.0,"No directions on how to put it on, but it was easy to figure out. There's no way to clasp the bottom part together and you have to just pull it up in your body, so if you have hips;DONT BUY!!!"
2.0,I was really disappointed with this shirt. When I first got it I thought it was soft and had some stretch to it. Sizing wasn't the issue though. The shirt is VERY stiff and the bottom half of the shirt never really goes down. It kind of sticks out around you and has a wrinkle/peplum look to it. I have washed it a few times hoping it would go down so I could wear it but it stays the same. Only difference after a few washes is the neckline stretches out. sad because its cute.
2.0,"Fits good, more like a nightgown than a summer dress. Good quality for the price, definitely a sleeper wear"
2.0,Too small across the shoulders.
2.0,"The dress arrived quickly and the pattern and material were as expected, but it is SO short waisted! Almost an empire waist on me, and I have 5’6” and 150lbs. I will be returning, I just didn’t like the dimensions on me. But the pattern is lovely and the material fits well, it’s just a very awkward cut."
2.0,It definitely runs small.
2.0,"Jacket is ok, but not the best material and does not run true to size. I would order 1-2 sizes up."
2.0,Size seems be running small
2.0,not what I was expecting when the package arrived. Seems dated.
2.0,"Look nothing like the picture they are much lighter and they are not textured. The material is pretty thin but not too thin, so that's good. They didn't look like weaving material but they still had a cool side plain look. They are extremely small and short. If you are taller than 5'8"" these will fit like capri pants. Make sure to size 2 sizes up. I'm normally a M but got a L and they felt like a small. I barely got them on pass my legs as they have no stretch in the leg part. I had to pull them by the leg first to my calf to make sure I could get them past my thighs and still I had to struggle to pill the leg part up more so I could get them over my but. For an example I'm really thin with barely a bump for a butt and barely any hips. 5'11"" about 165lbs. If you a very bump around that area don't bother they will not work. I tried to dance in these at Zumba class I managed but couldnt do squats to far down for fear of them tearing. I will try XL and see if that helps but the material could be better and you need to move in workout clothes so they should be very stretchy. All in all a miss if you are tall and have any shape."
2.0,"It was Ok , it TO BigFor my head and hard to see from..<br />It also came folded which Messed up the mask and looks Bent on one side, NOT THE MASK I BE USING FOR HALLOWEEN ..😅"
2.0,This is a great band. Protects my watch when I’m working out and doing chores but the white is no longer white.  I can’t get it clean and my return window is closed.  I have only had it 3 months and I don’t work outside or anything of that sort.  Just everyday wear at home and the gym.  It’s too bad because it is a great band just don’t bother getting the white because it won’t stay white.
2.0,"Really liked these when they came, however, after a short amount of time the red faded to orange or yellow...  maybe only after 6 weeks...  had to replace"
2.0,Disappointed because bow is missing!
2.0,It’s really cute but it runs very small Do yourself a favor and buy a size larger are you won’t be happy I just washed and dried it so stay tune for part two
2.0,2 months later I received it the package was all balled up & damaged .. its a cute top fits good
2.0,"Cute hat, and adjustable but way too small for my head.  I had to return it.  :  ("
2.0,"This dark brown belt arrived in a nice box.  It fit well and looked nice initially.  However, after a couple of weeks I noticed that, where the belt rubbed against the metal part of the belt buckle, the dark brown stain rubbed off leaving light-colored vertical marks next to the belt holes.  It seems that whatever dark brown stain was used in the manufacture of the belt it is not deep enough or permanent enough.  So, yes,  I can still wear this belt for working outside in the yard --  but can't wear it anywhere that requires nice clothing,"
2.0,Kinda bouncy for bigger busy
2.0,"This cover up looks very different from the picture online. It looks like a cheap, poorly made knockoff. It does not ruffle in the front as it does in their photo. It's flat looking. Beware!!! I'm sending it back now."
2.0,The material was of poor quality.
2.0,"I really wanted to love this dress but I hated it so much. I am normally a size L but all they had was XL. I should have gotten a 2X! The slit was insanely high and the neck line goes way too low. Besides these 2 major aspects, I thought the fabric was very nice and didnt feel cheap."
2.0,"Glasses feel way too fragile. They should have spring hinges since they’re so dainty feeling. The thin metal with the nose saddles bends much too easily. Probably won’t last a month. But , as always, biggest complaint if any pair of glasses...the arm touches the lens inside and started to immediately scratch it!"
2.0,Wrinkles so badly  I threw it away
2.0,Wrong size ( ordered a size six and they sent a size 9) just in time not to work for Easter. Color is more ivory than white. Went to exchange and they were no longer available. Shoes had dirt on the bottom like they had been worn before and straps had buckle marks on them.
2.0,an extra large should easily fit me but it did not. It was significantly smaller than a normal &#34;large&#34; sweater.
2.0,Not great but good for kids
2.0,Made vey cheap.
2.0,I did  not care for the hood.
2.0,fits nice but the underskirt is tighter instead of flowing like it looks in picture so it was to tight and if I would have gone up a size for the skirt to fit the bust would have been way to big. Liked it but because of fit I had to return.
2.0,Heavy and not comfy!  Would not buy again.
2.0,I liked it but they don't last long.  It tore on me.  I won't be repurchasing
2.0,I actually bought this purse 2 times just to give it a try 1 more time and I had it for 3 days and the strap broke. If I didn’t have issues with the the strap I’d love to buy again cause it’s a really cute purse with a lot of room.
2.0,I dislike that it came damaged the lace on the arms stick to the dress when I tried it on and it was snagging the dress
2.0,"I did not like it when it arrived.  The colors were very muted, and looked quite different to the picture. it had a general &#34;orange&#34; hue.  No issues with returning it.  Love Amazon for that!"
2.0,I was disappointed with this purchase just because it looks like your wearing a bag for a shirt
2.0,"I will start with the pros. Everything is very well stitched. It doesn't seem like it's going to fall apart the second i sit down (common with ordering things off of amazon). It even came with boot covers, not that i had planned on using them, but it was a nice surprise i suppose. However, the shirt and over shirt are the only two things i am not going to have to fix or replace in this outfit :c and $250 is hella expensive for being able to use just those two things right out of the package.<br /><br />Both the pants and the coat tails are too small to fit around my waist and i went by the measurements when ordering. I can sew a drawstring onto to coat tails and have them fit that way, but there's no hope for the pants.<br />The red sash is not wide and only long enough to wrap around myself once.<br />The belts are thin and flimsy (which is okay for me since i was planning on replacing them anyway) but they are also not very proportionate :/ the bottom on i have to pin on myself so it doesnt fall off. And on one of the chest belts the side with the silver hooks is too short and doesn't really show where its supposed to.<br />Speaking of pins. The pouches on the back are way smaller than the picture and held onto the belt with safety pins?!? How is that okay for this price?!"
2.0,It feels like paper and it doesn't look cute on at all.
2.0,Not very secure....spend to much for watch to risk using it...shame very pretty
2.0,"Used for1 month, the fabric between the card pockets is already ripping at the seams :/ if you don't use every slot then maybe it would last. But what's the point of so many card slots if you can't use them."
2.0,The material for this dress is really thin and cheap looking... also kind of see through.
2.0,"The SUMADE Unisex Ear Loops Balaclava is a nice, well made product.  The graphics are nice and the mask is pretty light and breathable.<br /><br />However, the negatives are pretty important.<br />First it is too wide (the circumference is too large) to properly stay above my nose.  I have a somewhat large head and long face/nose and I was constantly pulling the balaclava up.  I can't imagine what it would be like for someone with a smaller head/face because if I'd just allow it to droop it drops to my mouth.  Maybe if it had more stretchiness/elastic it would stay up, but it doesn't.<br />Second, its too light and airy to be an effective face mask for COVID.  I know that's not what they are saying its used for - but that's what people will do.<br />Third it stinks out of the packaging and even after a good wash it still smelled.<br /><br />Not impressed..."
2.0,The material is really plastic like. Had to return the item.
2.0,"Length is great, but material way thin. You could literary read the print on my panties."
2.0,Runs small.  Won't be able to wear it.
2.0,The product made is good but I had to give it away as the medium was too big
2.0,Much lower quality than other choker bracelets that I have bought. Within a week and a half of wear both bracelets (I got two for this price) became undone at the closing.
2.0,It's ok it's a shirt small for my wife I think she needs to go up two sizes because stuff from over seas are smaller then the women over here she thinks but shirt is beautiful and well made thank you
2.0,I would like to exchange them. I thought I ordered Large but recieved XL and they don't fit my son. But he loved the design .
2.0,Really cute but they only sent me 1 blue one really disappointing
2.0,It's exactly what I wanted but the hinge that connects to the watch face was broken. Seems like it's something that will break easily.. Tried to return for a replacement but all no can do is get my money back
2.0,Cute glasses but very small. If you have larger face they are not  good purchase
2.0,These are much smaller than they appear.  I gave them to my 6 year old niece and they fit her perfectly.  So far I have purchased 5 pair of Quay sunglasses and this is the only pair I purchased on Amazon and the only pair I don't like.  I guess I should have stuck with purchasing Quay's from the Quay website or Nordstrom's like before.  I will never purchase another pair of Quay's from Amazon...not sure if they are authentic.
2.0,"I like the actual shirt.  It feels high quality, fits great and is really comfortable. I don’t like the material used for the decal. That part is stiff (even after multiple washings), really shiny, and looks like a giant sticker taped to the front."
2.0,This dress is for a brides maid and it was too big. It also bunched up on the sides so now I have to figure out what to do before Friday. I will not order this again!
2.0,the shirt was actually a size large at most and not a true XXL. nice material though
2.0,No es un producto igual al de la página presenta defectos
2.0,I was really looking forward to receiving. Unfortunately when I did get the pair I received looked like they had been used and were scratched up pretty bad.
2.0,Got this for a friend's daughter's birthday yesterday. Super cute. Looked like it was made nicely but she wore it to school for the first time today and the Yoda charm fell off at recess and lost it. Would have given it 5 stars if it wouldn't have fallen apart on the first day of wearing it.
2.0,This is a CROP top...not a dipped hem...whatever that is! I was glad the sight offered returns. It went back the same day I received it!
2.0,Pretty top but way to small. I bought a large because of reviews and it fits like a small.
2.0,"The dress fit well, but you can see through it and honestly its not something I would want to worry about."
2.0,very small - my guy could not fit it
2.0,One side continuously falls off.
2.0,"It's super cute and I love how light and thing the material is...<br />But the XL felt like a medium.<br />I have a 38g bust, and this dress didn't even come close to wrapping around that area.<br />If I had a b cup however,  I would be all about this dress."
2.0,This us not necklace . Very small in size
2.0,"Beautiful but not a 2g. They measured 8mm, not 6mm."
2.0,No very good quality
2.0,The flap broke off the first time I tried to open it
2.0,Good material but even after I measured myself .. it's too small !
2.0,"Son, was disappointed because he thought the T-shirt was cotton but received a Nylon type of T-shirt. This T- shirt would be better looking on cotton rather than Nylon."
2.0,I’m a size 31 in Levi’s high waisted jeans. These were so ridiculously small. Not a 31.
2.0,"The pattern received is not the same as advertised. They are both notably different because what I received has way more white and drowns out the bolder colors. If you sell a product as pictured, then that is what I expect."
2.0,Item looks and feels cheaper than the picture depicted
2.0,As a plus size woman this has not worked at all for me. It was inconvenient didn't fit the hole or my body.
2.0,I didn’t like how thin of a material they were. I was expecting thicker fabric.
2.0,I got an extra large and it was too tight and I'm would like to believe I'm normal sized woman but apparently not to this skirt.
2.0,"First, the material is more polyester-ish and bcu I'm a ""plus size"" girl (top/bottom) the material stretched(which isn't a bad thing) and the color fades.<br /><br />I waa able to give this to my daughter who is a true size 11 and although baggy it still fit here (with a basketballish lose fit)"
2.0,"Clips dont stay on, within 5 mins if being at the wedding I lost one off my shoe"
2.0,Too small to hold change of clothes. :(
2.0,"For an inexpensive brand, the styling, materials, and workmanship are good. But the boots are ar least 3/4 if not a full size too small. I always wear a ten and even if some brands or styles do not fit right, they are never this snug. And to make it worse, I emailed the company RIGHT after Christmas to request a return label and still have not heard back, almost 3 weeks later!"
2.0,"Looks good, but the seam between braid and elastic is coming undone. I think that it might be easy to fix, but I would not recommend this product."
2.0,"Maybe I'm too strong(doubt it, for being a 5'4"" 125lb girl that doesn't work out) but it broke at the clasp the first time of use."
2.0,"Hat quality looks pretty decent for the price, but for an adult sized hat it didn't fit my head.  I gave it to my son (9 years old) and it was a snug fit on his head."
2.0,Looked hilarious on me and the material felt like a cheap Halloween costume
2.0,Tight……
2.0,"This bag was a lot larger than I expected and the color was not as true to the image.  The turquoise was quite a bit darker, almost a forest color, and not visually appealing.  I assumed, based on the dimensions, that this would be an excellent messenger bag for commuting to and from work, but it's entirely too large and flimsy for that purpose. Might work for a &#34;catch all&#34; bag, but not great if you're looking for any sort of structure or organization.  I returned this bag."
2.0,I wouldn’t buy these again. I only wear them at home. They are not the best quality for actually going to the gym.
2.0,the images or prints were so awful !! the chain and the necklace were ok for the price
2.0,"I really wanted this one to work, but the top and sleeves are far too tight. Such a pity- otherwise it would be a cool dress!"
2.0,The belt buckle functioned as reported.  The logo I received was different than advertised and it didn't fit my belt.  You may want to purchase a belt for this buckle.
2.0,I ordered my normal size and this top is huge! I spent the day adjusting my top and relying the knot tighter hoping that would fix it and it didn't.  Save your money!
2.0,I have what I consider a medium backpack and the insert did not fit. I think the purse organizers would work better and be more versatile.
2.0,"I ordered several different patterns.  The patterns are nice, but the quality is subpar.  They are nearly paper thin and the so called filter that comes with it is about as adhesive as bricks.  I plan to keep them, but will sew a filter into it."
2.0,Have only had this band for less than a month and the straps to hold the band down have already ripped off. I only wear my watch at most 6 hours a day during the week and never on the weekends. I feel like it should have lasted longer.
2.0,"No Insoles, hard as a rock, incredibly uncomfortable, and difficult to walk in."
2.0,Really wide and heavy also big
2.0,"Not what I expected to receive,  the pictures of the woman wearing is misleading and the cardigan is nothing like the photos. I should have watched the video. This is cheap and is white on the reverse and the collar cut you can see the white. Very disappointed"
2.0,I went to put it on and the straps ripped. Poorly constructed
2.0,This is nothing like measurements described! Need to send back!
2.0,Everything fit perfectly. But the awful fish smell gets stars docked. I’m hoping the smell goes away after being aired out for a couple days.
2.0,Much shorter in person than is pictured.
2.0,"I have no quarrel with the quality of this bag; however, I had a major problem with one of the phrases etched on the bag (specifically, Drug Dealer&#34;), so back it went."
2.0,"They looked cool, but the green tint makes for terrible visibility and that's a necessity with glasses. I only give the green ones 2 stars, maybe the other tints are better."
2.0,We washed these tights one time and all the color was out of them. They went from pink to a dull white color. Very disappointing.
2.0,Very cheaply made with a press on or iron on decal. There is no bling at all only a decal picture if the bling. Very misleading
2.0,It’s cute overall but order a bigger size and the slit was up the middle....
2.0,"It seems to be rather poorly constructed - it fits 'crooked' through the bust and gaps under the arms. The back hangs very much lower than the front. I like the color and the fabric, so I will shorten the straps, take in the underarm area, and shorten and re-hem the back to suit my needs."
2.0,"Super cute but the backing broke off within a day. Super flimsy, which I noticed and was ready for."
2.0,I love a high low dress. This looked ok on me. Not sure on the color.
2.0,This is Asian sizing. It has no padding. I’m a 38C doesn’t reach around the back  and the neck part feels like you’re Chocking ! And there’s no way to adjust the straps. Return is in progress.
2.0,1) too big<br />2) stain on chest<br />3) it looks better on the picture
2.0,"I really liked the style of the pants, so I ordered multiple colors. Having high expectations I was happy to receive them so quickly HOWEVER the sizes run Extremely small. The large charge fit like a medium. The medium fit like a extra small. Very disappointed."
2.0,Easily 3 sizes smaller than listed and while it does have darts in the bust area if you are anything larger than a C they will not accommodate. Bought the largest size and wound up giving it to my petite mother who usually takes a medium with some room to spare.
2.0,Material is cheap and reminds me of the house dresses my mom wore when I was kid. Just horrible material. Definitely not wearing
2.0,"It arrived with two of the colors broken, but otherwise the colors are very pretty and stick well"
2.0,The shirts are very rough. Very cheap material. Not satisfied at all.
2.0,Cute dress- I am just too tall.  The waist was not in the right place for me
2.0,Cute pattern but they stretch out quickly and you pull them up all day
2.0,This has turned into pj's because the size is way off. I am normally a large and ordered an XL so it would be big and it is way too small and I didnt want to hassle with a return so I just use it for night clothes.
2.0,"I bought this for a one-time use at a friend's wedding. I literally SAT and watched the ceremony, and then SAT and ate at the reception. I didn't dance, didn't hug a bunch of people, didn't have kids sitting in my lap. I just sat. And this thing didn't last the three hours. Pieces broke/disconnected and it just kind of hung there on my chest, lifeless and pathetic. It's reparable, but I expect my thirty bucks to last longer than three hours."
2.0,These were an extra large and they measured 16 inches at the hips! I think it was a girls extra large! I didn’t even put them on
2.0,"Order a size up, too small"
2.0,"description said these had pockets. if they didn't, I wouldn't have ordered them. I only found out after I had washed them & put them on that they did not have pockets. seriously disappointed."
2.0,Much blacker and smaller than they look.
2.0,Should been longer just dont like it
2.0,"I ordered these last summer for July 4th and they were a great hit.  This order was for stocking stuffers and children that I would be seeing over the holiday.  The description stated that  ""Each package will contain 4 finger lights each with a total of 10 packages you will receive. Each package comes with 4 different colored finger lights, no need to worry about receiving all white led finger lights that are disguised as colored finger lights by the colored exterior"", however, I received one bag with 40 lights.  Now I am trying to figure out how to give these as a gift to individual children."
2.0,"Too big & did not like the pocket on the front with writing, that isn't shown here!"
2.0,color not as described !
2.0,"I got this for my daughter who by all standards is an extra small. I read the reviews and ordered her a small instead. Wayyyy to small, had to return and ordered a medium thinking that would work.... IT JUST FIT. Will prob not fit her after a few months but for the price I figured she can use it while it fits.... EXTREMELY SMALL, I recommend getting 2 or 3 sizes larger"
2.0,Clasp is great. Unfortunately the watch itself falls out of the space for it. I've almost lost it several times. This clasp with a band that actually good to the watch would be ideal.
2.0,Great looking watch for a gift but not very durable and only lasted two weeks until the watch strap broke.
2.0,Good watch but band is a bit small
2.0,Tangles a lot. And not really proportioned as shown
2.0,"Feels cheap, and only makes things look yellow. No improvement in clarity for me. See the same, but no yellowing, without them."
2.0,It’s made really wide . Size down if you have tall girl I wouldn’t recommend.
2.0,"The pajamas themselves are absolutely beautiful. Unfortunately HaloVa's sizes run super super small. I normally wear size large, but after reading the reviews, thought I'd better order an XL to be on the safe side. I kid you not, although the top fit fine (probably size 10 or 12), the pants had a 13&#34; diameter waist & were only calf length!! My family & I were stitches as they wouldn't even fit on my head!. For the price, I suppose it isn't bad for a satin pajama top. Maybe I can make a pillow out of the bottoms."
2.0,The straps are not attatched. Its cute butt she cant wear it.
2.0,My wife is an A cup and she noticed the cup size was bigger. The space between the breasts were too close to each other as if they took a bra for a 34 and just extended the band.
2.0,it does not look like this picture
2.0,"It took more than a month to arrive,the ring was completly bent up and i had to fix it.i also had iron the fabric cause it was creasead!"
2.0,"The style was cute but the metal was chinsy and cheap looking. I thought it was going to break just taking it out of the package. I considered keeping it and getting it wet to dull the metal but opted just to return.<br /><br />The return was easy and I was immediately refunded my money, so that was a plus."
2.0,I liked the tshirt it just ran smaller and shorter than your typical XL
2.0,Se rompió el primer día que lo use.
2.0,"The material was very thin, and felt like costume-type material."
2.0,"I purchased this set as an alternate for vacations and occasional work days where my set might get banged up, unfortunately this set couldn't come close to passing as real.  The main stone is lackluster and the side stones are not apparent from an arm's length away.  The overall weight was disturbingly light, like a prize ring from a Cracker Jack box.  The bands did not sit well together due to the main stone's setting, which caused a gap between the two bands.  Overall size was at least a half size large with a noticeable size difference between the 'engagement' and 'wedding' bands themselves.<br /><br />I would not recommend this set, except for maybe a theater production."
2.0,Very pretty but broke the first time I wore it!
2.0,"We sent ours back. After looking at similar luggage at other stores, these were not inferior."
2.0,The picture looks better than the original
2.0,Does not fit.  It might if you have a big head.
2.0,"very nice but too big, and I bow is not a band as it seems in the picture it's just a piece of the fabric stuck in a loop"
2.0,"Product fits as expected. However,  it makes noise every step you take. Also, it smells like cigarette smoke  (both the packaging and the skirt). Very disappointing."
2.0,"It was nice while it lasted, but the spring snapped in just 4 months and it doesn't close tightly any more. If you are looking for durability, it's not the one."
2.0,"bands are too way big for any wrist, I had to go to the jeweler to get them fixed. Also Im having a hard time trying to install them on my watch and even harder trying to remove them. secure lock from the bands is also too weak, it will open with any just by pulling."
2.0,Two of the masks were great .the one that says Free Hugs not so much.That was the only thing you could read. The rest was hard to see and it was not sewn right.I was very dissapointed.
2.0,Don’t buy these ball would not twist off on some of them. Not well made pretty but didn’t get to wear the ones I wanted ball would not twist off.
2.0,"For the price, they will be fine until I can find another pair on sale. The bottoms are not rubber and even if they aren’t real rubber they have ZERO grip. They are super slick and my kids would eat it on a smooth surface."
2.0,The pants and button uo shirt were awesome. If i could of just kept them i would of. The sweater on the other hand was very short on length like it was shrank or something
2.0,"Really bummed that this broke in two months. My teenage son used the black skull one and he loved it. He is really careful with his stuff, and I don’t believe this was him being careless. It’s not aligned anymore, and since we need to keep his glasses safe he can’t use it. I wanted to get another but am worried it will break again.  This case has the best design for my son of any case I’ve ever seen. 🥲"
2.0,"Runs small in my opinion. I'm 5'6&#34;, about 135 lbs- usually a 2/4. Ordered a small and it was too small. Quality was a little iffy...would look better on someone with more curves."
2.0,It did work the one time I needed it to. But it wanted to fold in half causing pointed side. The sticky side supports didn’t hold and started to come off. Would t recommend
2.0,Too small and had to return<br />Looks good for the price though
2.0,Bra is way to small but the underwear is perfect fit.
2.0,"Definitely not what I expected. Low quality for the price. Did not stand up well to washing in cold water and drying in dryer on lowest temperature. Poor quality, I expected better.  :("
2.0,It doesnt fit correctly because of the crack so I cant even wear it.
2.0,Size is a little small and I purchased a larger size.<br />.
2.0,Son loved them.  They fit perfect and are super soft.<br />Very first wash and color faded considerably- areas that should be red are white.
2.0,This gloves are smaller than other gloves. They do not deal well with hot things. the rubber melts with heat and chemicals.
2.0,"For the price,it was extremely small"
2.0,Weird fit. The straps are sewn too short so it rises very high on your back and looks odd. Synthetic material makes it hard to “breathe” through but it is flown and that helps. I wouldn’t recommend it since the fit is so odd.
2.0,"there  too  small, they felt like  earring for little  girl"
2.0,I was so excited to get this swimsuit but after wearing it a few times the strap broke. I got a replacement and the same thing happened again!! Very disappointed. The fit was great everywhere except the bust. Overall very disappointed.
2.0,"There's nothing oversized about this, it's very small. I mean it's a high quality bag but it's just super small, I would use it as a backpack for school but I gaduated so, eh. This isn't ideal for traveling, at best it's an overnight bag."
2.0,"Didn’t notice much difference. Only yellow, but nothing different."
2.0,"Bummed.  Would be cute if it looked as pictured!  It’s a fall themed shirt (thankful & blessed) with the orange and burgundy writing, but has HOT PINK sleeves!!!!!  Ugh.🤦🏼‍♀️ Does run small so I ordered a size up.  Fits well, just disappointed with the coloring."
2.0,The material was super thin and cheap and stiff.. not good quality
2.0,"I wanted to love these... they are so cute, and even though I followed the reviews and ordered a size up, they are still too small... my poor little toes are smushed and it's too uncomfortable to walk in these.  =("
2.0,My daughter have only had these for about a month and I’m already on the second pair. If you just need them for a time or two they fine but longer wear I wouldn’t recommend.
2.0,Posts were VERY thick.  I had to force them through and they made my ears sore!
2.0,"Unfortunately will be returning, lovely fabric but bottom way too snug and shoulders way too lose. I am normally a 12-14 and bought an XXL"
2.0,"I ordered style A11 and while it is an ok scarf, it does not look like the picture at all!  In the picture I thought the dark color looked navy, but it is actually black. And the green is more prominent then I thought it would be."
2.0,"The item I received was absolutely filthy, it was covered in a thick dust or maybe even mold. It seems as though any sort of quality check was skipped over. I am disgusted and disappointed. I'll see about getting a refund or a replacement because this is unsanitary."
2.0,"Earrings came with a card but not on the card and they don't fit on it anyways. Earrings were in the bottom of the package, cheap, and posts are too long."
2.0,"Loved this for my hospital stay after delivering my son. I felt comfortable & covered. The color is gorgeous. Unfortunately, one of the seems looks as though it was never sewn shut- half of my armpit was bare in the hospital."
2.0,Fabric is attractive but it’s extremely hot! You inhale the gaiter when talking.
2.0,Cheap leather gets ripped through by teeth attaching the buckle to the belt. The ratchet adjustment works very well.
2.0,"These are only 12 inches long.  Would be fine for children, but do not fit well on adults.  Save your money and get something that is longer."
2.0,Did not end up wearing these for the wedding I was a bridesmaid in.  They were kinda cheap looking.  I got guess ya get what ya pay for with this.
2.0,Magnet not very strong. More than a few bills wont hold and if you put anything in the back pocket magnet doesnt work at all
2.0,"Very small in the waist even as it fits as expected through the hips. I think it's made for and would probably fit a younger woman better, one who is 'straight up and down' the body. I hardly ever wear it because it is so tight on my waist that it rides up when I sit down.  I wish I could just let it our 1&#34; in that area.  I should have ordered a side larger but then it's going to be baggy in the hip area."
2.0,Wife review- A liitle tight. Im a medium and sized up to a large squishes the boobs rather support. Haven't run yet but samsung with case is too big for pocket. Pass is my opinion.
2.0,well it is definitely beautiful but it was broken when it got here. :(
2.0,I was looking for a slim size bifold wallet.  This is more of a full size bifold. rather bulky with Airtag inserted.  Otherwise quality is great.  I purchased a different wallet from this company and was very happy.
2.0,great looking shirt had to return too small after ordering xl
2.0,"I do not like the material, it is kind of shiny and cheap looking."
2.0,"I thought these earrings looked so adorable for my 7 year old that is a Hello Kitty fan, but they were not the same earrings that arrived.  The ones I received were gold, not silver.  They just weren't as cute.  It was only a few days before Christmas, so I just kept them because I didn't have time to exchange them."
2.0,Even though I used the size chart...it was skimpy.
2.0,"I ordered this shirt based on the advertised cotton content which indicated 95% cotton, but it is 95% polyester NOT COTTON!!!  Returning ASAP."
2.0,I was disappointed in the quality of the material but I guess I got what I paid for.
2.0,It looks like a Hotdog on a Stick uniform. Had to return it immediately.
2.0,Still think these are so cute however the post on one wasn't glued on correctly but for that price I guess I can't really complain. Nickel just for size
2.0,"I ordered this for a gift for a friend.  Was very disappointed.  It seemed very cheaply made, doubtful that it is real amethyst and/or real sterling silver.  There was no certification or anything that it was real.  The chain was very light weight and small.  The gem seemed very lightweight as well.  The presentation was just eh.  The pieces came separate, in small plastic baggies, inside of a small jewelry box without any markings,  The whole box came inside of a plastic baggie.  Not impressed.  Returning it.  Definitely not worth the price."
2.0,Minor issues...the last one is totally crap cheap fabric
2.0,Too bulky. Returned to amazon
2.0,I loved the look but the size i order for my grand daughter was a perfect size for her but these socks where 2 sizes to small. Very aggravating when you expect them for the summer activities and they are to small.
2.0,Smaller than expected. One elbow is off.
2.0,The TREE!!! TALK ABOUT PLACEMENT PROBLEMS!! Who designed this!!! No way I’m the only one who sees a problem with the location of the TREE
2.0,I like long tanks but these are more like dresses.
2.0,There was no way to close the corset fit back. The cap sleeves hung from my shoulders. The champagne color was more of a beige. Not at all what I was expecting.
2.0,Too big.  Size makes it difficult to place in pocket. Also the phone compartment is divided which makes it awkward to place the phone in.
2.0,"Sorry but it's no for me. Returning, I cannot stand that material and it's very short on me. I'm 5'10"
2.0,"Didn't like these at all. I was shorted 2 beads and some of the volcanic rock beads were close to too big to use. They don't look nearly as nice as pictured. Out of 8 beads, only 2 were glass."
2.0,The sizes are way off...I ordered 6-9 months and the shirt is huge it will fit a 3 year old.  The shorts/pants seem to be the right size.
2.0,Too small the sizing is not correct. Definitely have to go up a size.
2.0,Very tight neckline. Once you get past that the shirts are well made and stand up in the wash/dry cycle
2.0,When i ordered these they said waterproof there actually not. They said white there not that either more of a cream color.  Not sure how long they will last. Two star because they look cute
2.0,I wore this suit last summer and it was great! I was going through my swim for a vacation I’m going on and I pulled this suit out. The bottom has elastic that is inside on the waist and leg openings. It was all cracked and snapped even more as I pulled them out. It left the waist and legs all stretched out. I can still wear the top which is the only reason it’s getting 2 stars.
2.0,"I really wanted this skirt to work because it's pretty and not excessively long (I'm 5'3"" and I need to hem most long skirts, but this one came down to above my ankle). I returned it because it's not wide enough. My waist and hips are about 28"" and 36"", respectively. Standing up, the skirt looks fine, but when I sat down, all was revealed! If the skirt wrapped around more, it world have been a great addition to the wardrobe. I suppose one could wear leggings under it, but I like a skirt because I don't want to wear pants. I think this skirt would fit someone of a size 2 or smaller well (I wear a size 4)."
2.0,They are listed as a narrow Width (C). They are just a basic standard width shoe. The box looks like it has been sent and returned many times. Misrepresented product. Not a bad shoe for the price if all you want is a standard width.
2.0,Fits small and doesn’t look as good as in the photo.  The color is more “heathered” than a solid color.
2.0,Arm fit tight very short in front runs a little small
2.0,It is too bulky. Not able to use the home key to access to the phone
2.0,I thought this had gears. Instead it is a picture. Am not impressed.
2.0,many clasps did not work. Some chains were damaged.
2.0,"I bought a large. I'm not a biiiiig guy, but I have a muscular butt. These short are just too small to wear in public at all. They are a good length, decent material, but the inseam is too tight down the middle. Unless you are very thin, buy one size up or even two sizes up, if you have a butt."
2.0,"I bought several of these for keychains and they all have broken!  Not the glass part, but the chain breaks from the mezuzah."
2.0,Cute on the model but extremely cheap material...
2.0,Cute shirt but runs very small. The 3x  fits like a xl
2.0,I don't think I would recommend this product. It is not as easy as described.  I used it to stretch the waistband on a pair of jeans. I had to be very careful not to break the zipper and the button closure. I was not trying to stretch the waistband 5 or 6 inches only 1to 1 1/2 inches. Not happy with this product so I gave it to a friend to try.
2.0,"I wore this bra about 5 times before I trashed it. While it held the girls in place well, it didn't hold up. I noticed that the e-clips (not sure what they are called) were pulling open after about 3 wears. One day, toward the end of a Crossfit workout, I was doing wallballs when I felt my right breast jiggling. The strap had popped off because the e-clip pulled open and released the strap. I finished the workout, stripped the rest of the bra off and threw it away. It's a good thing that I hadn't stripped off my shirt and was just working out in a sports bra or else everyone would have gotten an eyeful!"
2.0,Belt was too small for an adult but the suspenders worked good for my other belt.
2.0,"I really wanted to love this romper. Great price, great colors. But the quality is TERRIBLE. It's basically paper thin, which isn't always bad, but the fabric has no structure whatsoever. I'm not sure how anyone gets the neck to tie properly because it was all gappy and weird when I tried it on. Definitely returned it. I guess you get what you pay for. Hope it works for someone else!"
2.0,didn't love the quality or sizing. Oh well.
2.0,This is midi length.  It is much shorter and is more like something to sleep in.  Far too thin and transparent to wear outside.
2.0,Way to big and looks like a man's suit not a women's suit. Does not look like the picture
2.0,The lenses are loose .one sticks out more than the other.
2.0,"Way too thin , the larger earrings wouldn't stay in place so I threw them out . Also the stones already fell out."
2.0,Sizing was very misleading
2.0,Was more like a tunic top than a dress and I'm 5'3&#34;
2.0,Quality isn't the worst but I ordered this for my 4 year old nephew so I obviously got size 4-5. This thing is huge. It could fit me. Definitely wayyyyyyyy too big for a 4 or 5 year old. Could probably fit a 12 year old or even older
2.0,"Very cheap material, it's more of a swimsuit cover up. Than a dress"
2.0,"This shirt fit nicely around the body but it is a fact that this shirt is most def not long sleeved as stated in the description and the picture.  I tried to manually stretch out the sleeves but they remain too short.  I bought two of these shirts in size medium.  The other one fits perfectly, I love it.  It was the one with the blue torso that has really, really short sleeves."
2.0,"It is a cute shape and very comfortable.<br />The material is thin and shows off every bump, dimple, and underwear lines."
2.0,It was to large not what I seen in picture
2.0,It’s a nice mirabel dress but we only Tried it on and the light under the skirt came off. She didn’t even get to use it for any Halloween activities and I missed the return date by one day.
2.0,"This cardigan runs large and is a odd material--Not soft at all and has a very boxy shape. Overall, very disappointed."
2.0,"This dress was beautiful, but it hugged my waist a little too tight and since the fabric was very thin, it made it almost ""see-through"" !"
2.0,"I had bought these googles on Amazon before, and liked them very much.  I needed another pair, so I reordered.<br />These goggles are not the ones depicted in the photo.  That is how they USED to look.  They are far too small for me now.  I have to be very careful that they don't rest on my eyeballs.  I have to constantly readjust them.<br /><br />I wish they would have just left them alone."
2.0,The purse is small and as in other  reviews the liner gets stuck in the zipper all the time purse is unusable. Did not go to all the trouble of returning it just a waste of more money.
2.0,"thought it was better than what it was in person. The fit is ok, the design has been found elsewhere for much cheaper."
2.0,Definitely not Vans quality shrunk and Faded
2.0,"These earrings came to us bent and were so inexpensive, that I opted to keep them instead of returning them."
2.0,It gave her blisters 😒😒😒
2.0,Very cheap. The design is so cheap that you can see the black behind it! Should be sold at a dollar store!
2.0,"I thought the material was cheap and it was a bit large. The length was too short and the tights underneath didn’t hold me in. They looked cute but after the few steps, they ride up in the crotch area."
2.0,Tangles up and is a pain to untangle throughout the day.
2.0,"Wife says nothing great, not as big a deal as made out to be. Knocks down the light like sunglasses.  Just OK."
2.0,CHEAP and JUNKIE
2.0,"Pros: Relatively easy to build, nice looking. Con: One of the legs broke (bolt tore from base still attached to leg) after a few days of set-up, nothing heavy was on the table or had been. We've managed to rig it with some bolts we had on hand, but it doesn't look great and is disappointing to happen so quickly, even with a cheap piece of furniture.<br />There's no way I was going to disassemble and repackage this thing to attempt to return it, just to get another of the same quality."
2.0,Poor quality. Broke easily. Love the look though. That was unfortunate. My girlfriend was disappointed that it easily broke cause she loved them at first.
2.0,This belt looked and fit as advertised.  There was only one problem- it has a stench. The belt has a moldy smell-which has permeated through my closet.
2.0,This ring leaves a green mark on fingers.
2.0,Looks cute in screen but cut way too small. I thought it would be okay for work but the fit is too snug and I'm far too curvy to have something that form fitting.
2.0,"I ended up returning this product. It was a bit large in the bust area and unfortunately the material wasn’t the lightweight chiffon I expected (especially for the price tag). It was a cheap, thick, somewhat rough tablecloth material."
2.0,The lines show ALOT through most fabrics
2.0,Lovely blouse unfortunately sizes run small. Not made  for us full figured ladies.
2.0,"I got these earrings, as I liked the sun & moon design on the front.  When I got them, The stem that you put in your ear is on the back, so when you put them on, the design is facing your neck.  I still like them as the back (which is facing outwards) is just shiny silver, and you really can't tell that they are backwards unless you look, but I got them for the design on the front, and unless I want to put these on backwards (coming in from the back of my ear to the front), no one is going to see it."
2.0,"When I received these Shoes Socks, I am very happy, since it looks very cute. But after my son wore them on, I was very sad. The socks can't hold the feet well. I only let my son wear once and throw them away. Wast money."
2.0,"Earrings are very pretty. The latch is cheap, hoping they dont fall.apart."
2.0,"The fabric for these pants is awesome. It stretches so smoothly and feels great against the skin. But the fit - it was just all wrong for my body. The waist was too high, there were tight places and loose places and overall the pants looked so weird on me that I had to send them back."
2.0,"Love the dress, but not true  to  size."
2.0,it says 5X but is more like a 2X way too small.
2.0,"I gave this two star because this set is a beautiful set, but overall it gets a 1 because it doesn't stay on the side it supposed to be on. You have to constantly keep fixing it, which is a huge turned-off and annoying.  Make sure you don't wash your hand with it on or it will change color. I would not order from this seller again. YOU GET WHAT YOU PAID FOR!!!!"
2.0,Awkward fit. Runs small. Cheap material. Arrived with a run in the seam.
2.0,To dark and broke 1st day!
2.0,Used for about 5 months now and it already broke. The hole got bigger and bigger and eventually gave up.
2.0,"The material is meant to be a ruffled design, which means you would see the bottom side of the material if you moved at all - and the bottom has no print - just white so when the edges lift it looks super cheap.  I was not impressed with the cut in any way - not flattering on a fuller figure.  Returning."
2.0,Would not order again.
2.0,The body fits well but the arms are way too long. We would have to re sew the arms just to be able to wear it. Might return it if we don't give it away.
2.0,Came in with some of the beads fallen. They feel cheaply made but you get what you pay for I guess.
2.0,Looks like an old lady's nightgown.
2.0,This was a very sweet gift that was disappointing. It came in an attractive see through box and I anticipated the robe would be a thick and fluffy delight that you could wrap yourself up in ~ that was not the case ~ surprisingly very flimsy material. Definitely not worth the cost :(
2.0,Looks bigger not happy with the size
2.0,Simply too small for most men.
2.0,"The white piping is not even. It’s thicker on the right side of hat than the left side. The brim seems to be longer than usual, which makes the fit look awkward."
2.0,"Cute, but fall apart before too long."
2.0,Product fits but it’s a to hard type of feel fit
2.0,Disspointed fits like a night robe
2.0,"The pictures appears dark, it was sort of silver.  I didn't I realized being aluminum it would be very easily and the finish became very rough"
2.0,"leather is stiff, not easy to use,other than that seems to be well made"
2.0,"I followed instructions for measuring my head. Measured 3 times: 22.25"". Description says hat fits heads that are 22-24"". I got it on but it was snug, and it came down to my eyebrows. I could barely see.<br /><br />I ordered the light blue but received a dark navy/black hat.<br /><br />The snaps on the masks don't fasten because the snaps on the mask are smaller than the snaps on the flaps. The mask is huge and has no shape. My glasses could not sit over the top edge. Instead, the mask sat OVER the lower portion on my glasses, blocking my vision causing my glasses to fog up.<br /><br />This hat is, in general, poorly made--cheap fabric with cockeyed seams. I didn't wear it so I do not know if it's warm in 20-degree weather. I do not know whether it's waterproof, but I doubt it is because the fabric is cheap and thin.<br /><br />That said, I think the hat would be warm enough to keep one warm for about 30-60 minutes in below freezing weather. I didn't care that much that the hat was cheaply made because the price indicated that.<br /><br />Runs small.  Description says hat fits heads that are 22-24” circumference. My head (measured 3 times) is 22.25” and I still had to pull to get it on.<br /><br />Color: I ordered light blue but received a very dark blue-black. I could have lived with the color if other things were correct.<br /><br />Mask:  The mask is a large, flat oval shape. There’s no contouring and no metal bar to bend over the nose, so the mask leaves big open areas under the eyes. Therefore, my eyeglasses couldn’t sit on top of the mask. Instead, the mask sat over the lower edge of my glasses. This allowed my warm breath to fog up my glasses. My vision was blocked. I could have worn my own mask but I was looking forward to a warm, thick mask to protect me from cold and UVA/B rays (I have had skin cancers).<br /><br />Snaps: The snaps on the masks are smaller than those on the ear flaps. Even my big, strong neighbor couldn’t fasten them. If he had, I wouldn’t have been able to get the hat off!<br /><br />The hat is not very thick, but I liked that. Just not sure if it would have kept me warm in 25-degree weather. The fabric is very cheesy and poorly sewn. I expected that because of the price. This hat is probably NOT waterproof. I think is would be soaking wet after 15 minutes in the snow. I wanted this hat to protect my face from sun (brim & mask) and protect my eyes from sun (brim) while walking my dog and while snow blowing (can take 2 hours).<br /><br />I DO think it would be okay and fairly warm in dry weather. I would have kept it if I could see and the mask worked. I got a refund and gave the hat to a charity. Maybe it will fit someone who’s head is a different shape."
2.0,There’s no coat underneath. It’s not warm. The hood zips on and has a gaping space between it and the coat.
2.0,I am about 5' and this came mid calf. Ordered the small and it was too big. I was hoping to love this.
2.0,"Looks like the picture but definitely runs large, bought a small and it was still loose on me. Material feels cheap and thin. I'm returning it."
2.0,"This is a very cute outfit, but it does NOT fit well..Straps constantly fall off and shorts are too tight.  Not happy that my daughter wont be able to wear this."
2.0,4 out of 6 were stained right out of the bag
2.0,Product was way larger than shown in images on model. Don't wear due to the size being too large.
2.0,The band is too big and the cups are too small.  I'm not a fan.
2.0,VERY HARD TO WEAR FALLING CONSTANLY
2.0,Turkey came off pocket with in hours of wearing
2.0,"worn one time in a pair of Uggs, not shoes even, and after 1 wash already a hole in them.  Not as thick as advertised, and falling apart this early.  Not good.<br /><br />Would not recommend them to others, nor will I purchase them again."
2.0,"It's an ok coat. My son likes it but the problem is that I bought it for me. I'm 6' 235 lbs and the XXL arms weren't long enough for my body. The shoulder and stomach fit was ok. It's just too dang small. XXL would work for 5' 5"" to 5' 10"" probably"
2.0,The colors were too vivid for me and it was too big.
2.0,Too snug and too short
2.0,"They're functionally fine,  but they smell awful.  Maybe cuz they're real leather, but they smell like rotten meat or something.  They leave your hands/arms smelling that way too."
2.0,Artistic and box is amazing. Shade far compare with Rayban.
2.0,Very cute but they are small enough just to fit a baby.
2.0,"I normally am a medium in everything and can usually just buy anything in a medium and it fits perfect but this was clingy, too tight and very unflattering. The quality seemed good though so buy a size up."
2.0,"Besides being to large, the back is to low, so it doesn’t stay on, and rubs against my heel."
2.0,I’m 5’4 and this cannot be worn as a dress. It’s more like a tunic.
2.0,Esperaba mejor calidad del producto
2.0,The piece was a gift... The top doesn't stay connected to the bottom!!! Pin comes out....
2.0,"While this was so very pretty, it tore the first time I put my arm in it.  The stitching where the sleeve met the shoulder was not done well and ripped one minute after I opened the bag.  I took it to a seamstress here locally, so my ""savings"" really wasn't a savings at all."
2.0,print is different than it appears online. and they run large around the ankle
2.0,These are made of a silky material that slips down easily. I would not recommend for mask use.
2.0,"The top I got is a different cut than the one in the picture, which is disappointing. (The pointy section above her left boob isn't on mine, and the strap is different too.) The fit is also a little weird, with extra loose fabric in some parts. Despite these disappointments it's still a very interesting top, and I'm considering keeping it anyway."
2.0,"All three items are different colors, suspenders broke when I took them off the cardboard, was able to fix them but had to be careful not to break them again. Bow tie and cufflings looked and felt as cheap as they could and the pocket square was just as bad. Keep looking!!"
2.0,"I’m about 180Ilbs and a 36D, got this in a medium and it was tight on my stomach. Defiantly not thick knit material like it looks in the pictures to. Not a fan"
2.0,There is a obvious &#34;reset switch&#34; on it that completly negates the purpose of the lock.
2.0,"No way these earrings are real Sheila Fajl. Mine are so bent after one wear. My pair I ordered directly from Sheila Fajl do not bend at all. If these are real, the quality has gone way down. They are still pretty but I can’t get the dents out."
2.0,"I bought 2 differant styles, same brand, both xxl, one was too big, the other to small, what the heck, must not have any quality control here, after they are made size the accordingly, but your not getting izod, Ann Taylor, Liz Claiborne here, plastic zipper cheapens the look."
2.0,It looks like from the photo it’s all one piece. However it’s not.... the sleeves aren’t attached!
2.0,"Huge, sticks once then its done. Not a bad price but NOT REUSABLE. Change the description. Very misleading to think I can reuse when cannot. Lost a boob in the middle of the day due to trying to wear a second time. It fell off an my breast fell out of the shirt. Great ONE TIME USE. NOT FOR MULTIUSES"
2.0,I’ve had them 6 months and the material is already see through.
2.0,Very cute top and I really wish it would fit me. Wasted my money on it. Plus when it arrived a button was off. I don't have the time in my busy schedule to return this or I woulf have. I normally wear a 2XL top which is what I bought and I am pretty gifted in the chest. I was able to get it over them but the bottom hem on the shirt is super smaller than a 2X. A 2x would better fit a large.
2.0,"Too Small, the picture is deceiving 😞"
2.0,My 3 year old loves the hulk but this was so tight on his face he felt nervous and scared. He’s worn masks and this style before. He’s on the small end for his age too.
2.0,"Loved it at first... But within just a couple of months, the paint wore off. I was devastated because I really liked it a LOT. :("
2.0,Too small for me. But I have a barrel chest so it's hard to find the right fit
2.0,I know am on the large size when it come to shoe but come on the insole on these Uggs is so thick I can't even get my foot in.  Why I really wanted these Uggs but I have to send them back.
2.0,"While this bag looks nice, hinges for the straps to the front are poor quality. Within the first 2 wks the pin holding the strap to the bag on one side fell out. A month later the other one is slipping out so that if I don't have it repaired soon it will also come out, as with the first one...disappointed"
2.0,"This is just a tank top. If you're looking for a shapewear top, move along. The tank is baggy on me (and I'm not a tiny person)."
2.0,The color matches with the rose gold watch. It looks nice but catches on to different types of fabric.
2.0,this way way to big. It was even big on me. And it was supposed to be for kids.
2.0,I've bought a couple haven't found the right one. This one is really small. Almost didnt reach the hole. The thickness is perfect though. I also got the next size up that one is better just a little thick and not fitting to my nose.
2.0,doesn't last long.. soles wore out from normal daily use within 45-60 days.  The rubber soles are too soft. Definitely not worth the price. I cant even wear them anymore and have to trash them as they hurt my feet now..
2.0,"What a waste of $25 and I have no options for return/exchange.  The buckle broke after only 6 months of use.  Never buying a ""Yooside"" product again, as I've had similar quality control issues from their products in the past."
2.0,"Arrived on time.  It looks like the shirt that I select... BUT,<br />I ordered an XL and this shirt is WAY too small.  I'm always careful about washing in cold water, and no heat drying.... but still, I can't believe that anyone in their right mind would market these sizes so incorrectly.  Compared to my other XL shirts, this shirt is more like a medium.  I'll pass it along to my nephew... it may fit him.  Maybe."
2.0,I ordered these for a 2 day 1 night water park stay. They fit a little small and already are falling apart/fabric separating from the sole. I'm not terribly upset since this was the only thing I needed them for and they were cheap.
2.0,Wasn't impressed. Glasses made little difference in reducing glare from lights and didn't improve on any clarity at night.
2.0,Not thick.  Not fuzzy.  Least appealing wool socks I’ve gotten on Amazon.  May as well buy dockers dress socks - same thickness.  Returned.
2.0,Little short. Only about 6 inches if you don’t include the clasp as the description says. They stated 7 inches but it wasnt
2.0,See through and very cheap material
2.0,very light weight and cheap
2.0,"This product fits poorly, is not true to size."
2.0,Make when you order these HOT Sexy Women Sexy Lace Top Thigh-Highs that you order one or two sizes bigger than you really are. I loved the advertisement and the idea behind this new look but when I tried the Thigh Highs on myself I was disappointing. I gave this rating because I wasn't happy with the way the advertisement and the actual product compared.
2.0,very thin and skinny jacket. Ordered two sizes and the length is off too. Cheap.
2.0,"Very nice looking, that's why there's more than one star. After two months I started seeing black residue from the band rubbing off on my wrist. Four month after purchase, the nub that the clasp closes on broke off and now the band is unusable."
2.0,the torso was too long for my taste. it didn't quite fit nicely because of this. returned the item.
2.0,Beautiful bracelet !!!!!!!<br />Too bad it doesn’t have a clasp to put it on<br />Way too small to fit over hand
2.0,Soooo tiny. Sizing is not correct. I order a medium and couldn’t even get it on. I’m 5’ 4” 160 and am going to need an extra large I am not an extra large. My 115 pound teenager could hardly fit into the medium.
2.0,"The dress was cute and fit as expected. However, when it arrived, it had a white mark down the front like it had been pressed with an iron that was too hot. It had to be sent back."
2.0,"Extremely disappointed. Was happy until I tried it on. Notice one side was ripped. Decided to see how it fit anyway in case I wanted to exchange instead of getting refunded. Well, that other side ripped as well. The trainer is big so it wasn’t due to being small. Cheap material was used. I wanted to work out in this but it looks like that’s not happening.  Update: Amazon sent me another trainer a few days after I informed them of the defective item. And that shaper trainer was garbage as well. It came completely intact. But after 2 wears, it ripped at the thigh straps. The material is cheap! Do not waste your money!"
2.0,"I ordered it on the larger size. It was not necessary. Could have ordered true to size, I think. The main reason I didn't like it was the feel of fabric and shape/fit."
2.0,"I am very thorough before ordering jeans online. I always look at the sizing chart. These jeans are a great quality, thin denim. Sadly, they are not curvy girl friendly. They do not fit over my hips.  I am 5’7” and 195lbs. I wear a size 14 in pants. I wear a large in shirts and 40DD in bras. I ordered an xxl based off the size chart. They were way too small. I would definitely recommend ordering a size or two up. However, probably not for plus size women."
2.0,"The thing broke after using it for like two minutes, and there were several dabs of black on the bill image."
2.0,"After I received these, they are way too long."
2.0,Crap is made I. A basement out of old pillow cases. Pretty sure all chapstick k will fall out wife is angry.
2.0,"The set is a good value even though the shirt is no fit . I bought my man's regular shirt size and the collar barely fits bit the shirt itself is so large it looks like he is wearing a balloon , it is very very large . The rest fits ok and is of decent quality , not fantastic, but ok . And it's still a good price for everything without a shirt, so I was considering to keep it at first and just get a different shirt. Returned in the end in exchange for a different set and a separate shirt."
2.0,The bottoms were of good quality im terms of stitching and sizing but the top is awful! It has an oddly wide band and the straps stick out in numerous places. Only buy this if you're down to spend the listed amount for the bottoms and finding a different top (what I ended up doing)
2.0,"I bought the pink and green in an XL. It didn't feel like an XL at all. The material is weird... see-through, cheap, and silky-feeling. And because the sizing was off, it stretched making the dress look white in some spot. A little stretching would have been fine but it was pretty bad. The flowers look funny too. Nothing like the picture."
2.0,It was a gift but the coat was way too small.
2.0,"I should have listened to the reviewers who said this jacket was more akin to costume clothing than business attire. The problem isn't just that the material is thin, but that it will not hold its shape. It lays on your body all the wrong ways. Definitely could not wear to work. Also, I did not like the design of the back flap - my little brother said it looks like a butt-hatch that can be lifted when you need to attend to nature."
2.0,"The picture shows a mustardy-yellow almost, but this item is bright yellow . Picture is deceptive"
2.0,Even for given measurements this item is too small. Order one size larger than you think youll need
2.0,This band broke less than 3 days after getting it. The metal clasp part fell off and it is unusable now.
2.0,"If this dress had been a smaller size i would have loved it. I'm 5 foot 6 and weigh 125, the top part did fit nice but I was swimming from the torso down lol it's a good stretchy material, and apparently, despite my best efforts with a good hot wash to try to shrink it- it doesn't."
2.0,Very thin material with almost no stretch at all. Especially the waistband has zero stretch along the seam.
2.0,They looked and fit good but the second day one of the three pairs started to separate at the rear pocket. By the third day there was a large whole and another pair started to do the same thing
2.0,The pictures of the pants show slim fit legs and ankle length. The pants I recieved are regular fit legs and shoe length.
2.0,You cannot use these unless you have adapters to hook in both ends.  I don't know how you would use these otherwise.
2.0,"I have purchased many Jones New York pajamas thru the years but this product was of a lesser quality, akin to &#34;outlet&#34;quality, and did not meet the higher standard i was expecting."
2.0,the dress is gorgious but i have to return it its entirely to small at my reg size it runs small
2.0,It doesn't fit. It doesn't looks good on my husband.
2.0,"The dress is beautiful. However, it did not arrive in brand new condition. I could tell the dress was worn and soiled. I was very unsatisfied with the quality of the product. It was unclean."
2.0,"If you have no feeling in your feet, then this is a nice looking shoe.  Good looking but heavy and clunky feeling.  I normally wear a normal width and these felt too tight in the toe box and sides.  The heel was also very loose fitting.  The insole was too contoured and didn't offer a lot of heel padding.  Maybe with some aftermarket insoles, they would have worked.  The construction looked good and i can't speak to their durability but they didn't fall apart in the 30 mins i wore them.  Amazon daily deal price was great, but it doesn't offset the fact that they are just really uncomfortable."
2.0,Shirt was too short
2.0,I got this in a size l/xl ( my normal sizing) which it states it fits sizes 10-14. I’m a 12 and could barely pull these on. Once I got them on they were completely see through. Partly from the sizing but also the leggings themselves are very thin.
2.0,"Color says lime and looks lime online, but it really NEON green/lime, super bright! Fits nicely, but completely see thru. Returning it."
2.0,one of the 5 pairs of rubber holders were broken............based on the price I decide to fend w/ 4 in lieu of sending back for replacement.  Others work fine.
2.0,"I ordered this dress, and what arrived did not meet my expectations. The material was very flimsy and very sheer.  The dress felt cheap and the color was not at all like the picture."
2.0,This product is itchy and does not get tight enough.
2.0,More Amazon junk
2.0,Doesn't look like the picture exactly. Like a cheaply sowed version of it. Her butt still looked nice in it but nothing she could wear in public nor anywhere really.
2.0,I like the way they look and the adjustable ear straps as well as the nose adjustment to keep my glasses from getting foggy. The inside lining is not attached to the outside so every breath I take it sucks into my face making it almost unbearable to wear.
2.0,I normally wear small however if I were going to reorder this I would need to at the minimum order medium however large would probably work better.
2.0,"The finition of the vest is not good,for this vest I don’t give more than $10"
2.0,These shorts were baggy and shapeless
2.0,I love the length but it is cut too small for a large
2.0,"It's a cute bag, but I don't believe it's leather. The handles, maybe?"
2.0,"I ordered the &#34;khaki and beige&#34; pack, expecting what the picture showed: an army green, and an ivory-type color. Instead, I received what can be described as a light brown, and a dark brown. I was going to wear them with taupe boots and they don't match at all. The quality matches the price, but I am upset at the drastic color difference."
2.0,"I will honestly say that I am a bit top heavy, so it did not fit me. Had to be returned."
2.0,It said size 6 that I was ordering. But when it arrived it said 5 -6. If i knew that I would have went up a size.
2.0,"I love how the feathers look on this necklace, but they broke off the chain before I even got to wear the necklace.  Very disappointed, the necklace itself was cute, I was looking forward to wearing it."
2.0,Cheap fabric. Doesn't match the photo exactly.
2.0,"This top looked great in the photo.  It is both large and small on me.  The bust is too large, it just sags even though I have plenty to fill out a top.  The waist is too small.  I tried it with a cami underneath and it would work except it stretches around the waist too much for me making me look dumpy.  I got it in white, it is somewhat see-thru, colors probably wouldn't have this issue.  This top is not for me, will return."
2.0,It's small in the chest area. Beautiful dress though. Just wish sizing chart was better
2.0,Way to cheap
2.0,"I ordered a medium but I received small bottoms and a medium top. Unfortunately, I washed it before I realized they were mismatched so couldn’t return. After the wash (& air dry), a few spots on the shorts are already unraveling. Cute set but poor quality control."
2.0,Doesn't really look like the picture and is very uncomfortable.
2.0,"It's a very cute watch but for the cost of it, it should be waterproof. It's made for small children so it only makes sence it be waterproof. The first day my daughter wore it after getting it for Christmas forgot to take it off before getting in the tub. She took it off after one dunk in but that was all it took. The screen filled up with water, powered off and never came back on. We put it in rice but there was no saving it. For the exact same price I got my son a smart ""sport"" watch and the size and shape were the same which is why I got them bc they were gifts the ""matched"" eachother. His watch is waterproof. It's really the only thing that makes sence. So bc of that I do not recommend this watch and will be the first thing I say about it. With as many watches that are out there now for around this price range go for one that's waterproof of you're buying for a small child."
2.0,"This wallet looks great, and is quality made. It might work for me if I only had 3 or 4 cards to keep in it. The wallet I'm currently using is just to thick for me, but this wallet is even thicker! Calling a &#34;slim&#34; wallet is a misnomer, quite misleading. You can see in my pictures my old wallet,  a bi-fold with a flip pocket, is about 3/4&#34; or 19mm thick when full. The Minimal Gear Slim Wallet with the same things in it is almost 1&#34; or 24mm thick, the picture doesn't show the strap which adds about 1mm to the thickness. This is way too thick to fit comfortably in either my front or back pocket."
2.0,Looks good but broke w/in 2 days. Hard to set time....it kept changing when you accidentally pushed button
2.0,Pekeña
2.0,Was very small and not correct condition
2.0,"Have had good success with ordering shirts online, but this one was not so good.  Material wasn't what I expected...maybe I didn't read well, and it was very tight so the size it smaller than what you might usually order."
2.0,Actually doesnt glow. Like at all.<br />It came with a bead inside that glows in the dark but youd have to charge it a while to get it to glow and it would not look like the photo at all.<br /><br />very dissatisfied.
2.0,Did not like fit or comfort
2.0,"Very cheaply made, Falling apart at the seams, zipper came off track after only two uses. My son likes dinosaurs and dressing up and he's got a  Goku outfit we bought at the same time that's in perfection condition while the dinosaur outfit is practically in taters."
2.0,"This bra would have been perfect, however the straps are not fully adjustable. If you have a large chest, you need this feature and unfortunately after wearing it for less than a day, I already began to notice a lack of support."
2.0,Product is not 50L.  It is a small backpack.  Buyer beware
2.0,"Returned for refund.  Shirt came noticeably faded to gray inside the rectangular shape it was folded into in the package, on the front and back side.  Good looking shirt, though the rear image was huge taking up the whole back. A bit too big for my taste."
2.0,Cheap product. Don't waste your money. I was very unhappy with overall look and quality
2.0,"The item is described as having pockets, which it does not.  The item has a very stretchy, almost swim-suit fabric.  The item is cut for a petite woman, with bust area not large enough to stay in place; during movement, the empire waist creeps up to mid-bust-line.  Otherwise, the item is good quality with lovely lines and nice details.  I'll give it to a more petite friend rather than return it."
2.0,"These sandals are a GORGEOUS blue in person; it was true to my monitor, which was EXACTLY the shade I had hoped for. They are comfortable, even for a day walking the local zoo. They are easy to get on and off and look super cute. I usually wear a 7.5, so I got an 8 and they fit perfectly. love them!<br /><br />UPDATE: Not even a month later, the sole separated from the top of the shoe. They did not get wet, weren't worn daily, and really had nothing happen to them. We were walking through the mall when they decided to split!"
2.0,"Took a long time to arrive. Cup size was too small. And there were weird balls or marbles or something, in the bra padding."
2.0,Muy bonitas y buen material y comodidad pero quedan grandes
2.0,"I’m 5’6” 145lbs. I usually order a medium in bottoms maybe a large if there is no stretch, but this skirt was way way wayyyyy too small. I ordered a M and I couldn’t even get the skirt past my thighs. I’m considering ordering an xl but then I’m considered the skirt will be too long. Runs very very small!!"
2.0,"Didnt fit right for my body, I guess"
2.0,These were most definitely a size 2x/3x. More like a medium
2.0,The fit was good but the inside of the cups had a rough seam making it uncomfortable to wear the top. Cute suit with high waist bottoms. I will be returning due to the poorly placed seam in the cups.
2.0,The pieces are great but they were a lot bigger than I expected and I was not warmed up front that they are non-returnable and no one will contact me back.
2.0,Color was too light (almost white). Thieves are plainly visible when I wear them and I'm extremely pale person who gets next to no sun.
2.0,Tshirt is a rough material. Print looks faded. Sizes from a little small. Was not impressed.
2.0,lovely dress but fits very small
2.0,As soon as I received this cuff and tried to put it on the cuff part broke! This product is VERY cheaply made!
2.0,"Can’t get the wrinkles out of the shirts , even coming straight out the dryer! Even though it says wrinkle free, other then that shirts fit great, I was trying to get at least 40 to 50 shirts but we need them to be wrinkle free do you have any other product?"
2.0,Was disappointed in the fabric on this. I ended up sending it back. The pink on the flowers is really gross in person and doesn’t look good on the green.
2.0,"This is a regular blouse, I think we can find the same quality and much cheaper price if you buy in that website from china, I feel is the same product, no the best quality."
2.0,"Waaaaaaay too small. Loved the design.  I have small hands/wrist, but it was way to hard to get off and on.  Had to return it."
2.0,very small in the bottom half and quite see-through.
2.0,About 2 sizes to small.
2.0,"The color is the same, But they are seen through. I order an XL, but they are like an L OR M SIZE. I really liked the color thats the reason I ordered this but since I practice boxing this are not good to workout. Not even to do some squats."
2.0,"I wish I could rate this item better since i loved it so much. The suit is exactly the same as picture which I was super happy about. However,  the pants is missing a zipper. I also followed the seller's instructions and ordered  large since I'm a medium size. The pants is perfect fit but the jacket is actually large. So, I have no choice other than returning it. If I  could get the large pants with a medium jacket, I would have reorder it again but I guess that option is not available."
2.0,"This is too small, but shipping is not covered to return.  I bought two sizes up, still too small.  Keeping to avoid the hassle of a ​return."
2.0,"Was really disappointed. I could have went to a craft store, bought a men's tshirt and did the iron on myself."
2.0,Cheap for the price
2.0,I liked the bag but the wrist strap broke the first day I used it.  That and the size were the main reasons I bought it.
2.0,I like style and heels but they are hard to put on. Once I get them on I can’t zip them up.
2.0,"These pom poms are puny and squished looking, not like the pic. They are also sewn on down low just above your ear.  It looks hilarious. The beanie part is puny and thin too.  It’s nice that I ordered some similar beanies to compare them to.  Sub-quality."
2.0,Very pretty  .. but mine came broken.  So I had to trash it .was not even able to fit it
2.0,smalll
2.0,Not a good fit at all unless you are a size 1. Would not recommend because they are not high waist leggings.
2.0,Cannot see through the glass due to imperfections and they arrive will both lenses scratched in the center.
2.0,No hold..not what I was loooking for.
2.0,Not the best quality. Although for the price not bad. Unfinished back side kind of ruined the Aesthetics.
2.0,"The bag is huge (about 3x the size I need) so things get lost inside the bag. I don't know what kind of luggage this is supposed to go with, but I have a hard time getting it on my luggage's arm and most of the time give up. Going to by a different bag next time."
2.0,"I wore the bracelet for a few hours and one of the ""metal"" ends came off."
2.0,Cute design but way to tight in the thigh area and very very thin fabric don't bend down to much in them or they'll rip and wont keep you warm at all.
2.0,The shirt runs large.  I purchased a small and it was way to big on me.  I’m 5”0 and don’t like clothes that swallow me whole.  I ended up giving it away.
2.0,This blouse has tight sleeves and the proportion isn't standard.  I was disappointed because the photo makes it look better than it is.
2.0,"I got my case today and was disappointed in the quality. The image was blurry and the case looks different than whats posted. The sides are larger so the image is smaller than in the picture. The only good thing was the fast shipping . Had i got whatbi ordered, it would have been a 5 star since the design is so pretty"
2.0,I wore this with a backless dress when I was maid of honor in a wedding. It fell off during the ceremony. I give it two stars instead of one because it did fulfill it's purpose nicely for about two hours before it jumped ship.
2.0,I bought this shirt thinking it would be easy to nurse in with the buttons... but after receiving it I felt like the material was kind of cheap and the size small was oddly long. Not sure if it’s just a bad batch but didn’t love it and ended up returning it.
2.0,Ball chain extremely cheap.<br /><br />Had to purchase another.<br /><br />Pendant is larger than I expected.
2.0,The mediums are too small almost like is European sizes
2.0,The item received was not what was listed. It was supposed to be black but the item I received was navy blue and not made of the material listed in the description.
2.0,I received two of the same hand.  Didn't realize until on vacation had to wear the other hand with the buckle embellishment  under the backside of my wrist. These gloves are like fleece material. The top side is a nicer fleece/light weight suede like material. They kept my hands warm in 40 degrees. I didn't get to use finger pads bc gloves were awkward to wear with both same hand. If I had received a matching pair given the price I would give 3 stars.
2.0,I’m typically a large and ordered a L and XL as sometimes amazon clothes run small. I’m larger chested (36DD) and even the XL was too small around the chest. Returned both.
2.0,"Fits small & after the first wash is even smaller. if you buy this, buy it 2 sizes bigger."
2.0,These would be a little nicer and perhaps I would like to keep them if the inner and outer materials matched up more seamlessly.  The fabric and the inside sauna materials seem to be pulling against each other making them uncomfortable for wear/use. I'm returning them.
2.0,I would reccomend on getting a size ir two larger. The sizing is extra small for larger people. But it is an awesome shirt!
2.0,Too smal and not atractive!
2.0,the sewing is wrong. the stitch is at the end of the toe when it should be over the toe which makes them uncomfortable to wear. I cant recommend anyone buy these.
2.0,"These look similar to items by Vanity Fair and Jockey (which are identical), but the fit and coverage is much smaller.<br /><br />If you want to return them, the seller does not seem to offer a shipping label or tracking."
2.0,"The lenses are bent into the frame. They look really cheaply made, and I wouldn't recommend them."
2.0,Nice design but there was glue all over the stones.
2.0,Did not fit accordingly
2.0,"The dress is attractive for the price.  It is much too short to be considered a dress, however.  I’m 5’ 3”, 105 lbs. I ordered a small which fits, but the length is mid-thigh.  I missed the deadline for returning, so may wear as a top."
2.0,The seams were all uneven and the waist completely twisted so it didn’t fit normally at all. Very cheaply made
2.0,"Generic. T shirt material. Very little stretch. Shows off any curve, even the ones you want to hide."
2.0,It wasn't expecting to get something that  was completing different from the picture that you had... I order it because it was different. . Now my son doesn't want them. .
2.0,"looked funny on, the sides are weird and bulky"
2.0,"I used the chart and still, way too small - arms are very tight, and no give in the fabric. Really pretty but it is also very thin fabric. Didn't work. Company did make it right."
2.0,Not a fan of how the top lays. Looks big
2.0,okay if you dont want to be called out on how fake this is then buy it but if you have pride and dont wanna be laughed at dont buy it
2.0,the jumpsuit runs small- so I should have ordered a medium
2.0,"Decent quality, colors do not match what is advertised, and are a solid size smaller than any of my saddle plugs of the same size."
2.0,Extremely Dislike the material. It's itchy and attracts dust/ fuzzy material. Just very uncomfortable for sensitive skin people.
2.0,I fell in love with the first pair but the second was about 4 sizes smaller although they look the same. Even the pair that fit was very fitting. Maybe more for working out than going our in for me.
2.0,Seller was great - the product was way smaller than it appears.  Seller was great and fast with the refund.
2.0,"thin cotton fabric (can easily see through it held up to the light ) no place for filter, no testing or evaluation for protective use. Seems to only meet the ""letter of the law"" when groups are mandated to mask while singing.<br />Would NOT recommend.<br />FYI I purchased directly, not through amazon."
2.0,Overpriced and not very warm
2.0,"The color is nice and is same color as picture, but I did NOT get a chunky beautiful hat like the pic. I am returning. Mine was thin, and the white was badly knitted in there, and the pom was small. I usually wear a small (and often youth) size hat and this was pretty snug even on me. First pic: what I expected (pic advertised) 2nd pic what I received."
2.0,Steams up
2.0,"I must say that the hoodie fits and looks amazing when you receive it. It's also very comfy. The problem is that there is no way it will last more that 6-12 months.<br /><br />After your first wash, the sheen fades noticeably. After the second wash, the color starts to fade as well.<br /><br />I've had the hoodie for three months and I've worn it about once per week - about 14 times. I can already see it falling apart. The fabric is pilling signifigantly and the edges are slightly starting to frey. I'm wearing it for casual situations- no workouts. Mostly lounging. I've worn it on two flights.<br /><br />I dont see it realistically lasting another 3 months. In contrast, I have hoodies that I've been wearing for 10+ years that are in better shape than this one. Because of that I'd say that you shoud be weary of the good reviews being from immediate reactions.<br /><br />I gave it one extra star for the color, fit, look and comfort when first unpacked.  Other than that, I'd say stay away. The hoodie is not meant to last, and fast fashion is such a waste."
2.0,This seemed like a counterfeit. I had to send it back.
2.0,"Poor quality, and the back is a lot shorter then the front."
2.0,Sent Back.  Way too small.  I bought a lot of these cut type socks and this manufacturer runs very small
2.0,The size and the color
2.0,Looks good if it stayed inflated
2.0,Becuase its ribbed and very cheaply made. I didnt even bother trying it on. Went right back.
2.0,Returned this dress sadly. It is fleece & the neckline is not off the shoulder it is a small crew neck & i can't stand things that are up around my neck. The bottom of it fit well & was cute but the neckline & it being fleece & not normal cotton sweatshirt material ruined it for me.
2.0,I don't know if my product was defective  but I've had it for 3 months and it broke already.
2.0,Nice look. However after only a month the bottom is wearing away and there is a hole.
2.0,Pide una talla más
2.0,the sticking wore out the first day
2.0,It wasn't very pretty too small
2.0,"They’re okay but if you have pants that are always rubbing on the piercing, I’ve had two of the top balls that screw on break this way. I would say try a different product."
2.0,Shirt was XL. It wouldn’t fit a small child.
2.0,"I have worn these two days so far. First day was fine, no pop-offs or anything. But now, 4 hours into my second shift they have become unclipped 4x so far and I am wearing the exact same kind of s*** as in the first day. Very frustrating. I didn't even have the standard pain-in-the-butt stays come loose this often."
2.0,The areas where this attached to the watch face were pretty but the band was ugly. The band magnet held well but I don't know how long that would be the case.
2.0,"While they’re a cool idea, I’m not sure I’d buy these again- probably wouldn’t recommend them to you guys, either.<br />They feel pretty cheap, nothing close to what they cost. They slide down my calves- probably bc they’re ‘like cantaloupes,’ & I think I got two of the same side..."
2.0,Love the design of the sleeves. But what they don't say is that these are a large. So if you have slender/boney arms these won't fit. :(
2.0,"This bikini is super small!! I am very disappointed, i have a bigger chest (34D) and larges typically fit me perfect but not this one. This only covered my half way and not in a good way. The pattern is adorable , if you have a smaller chest I’m sure this would look great!"
2.0,"Good looking cooler, but it leaked on first use."
2.0,Handle was dirty and scratched up when I received it.
2.0,I was sitting down on the couch and i had it on and it just popped off….
2.0,"I loved this once I got the hang of putting it on! Washed it first, then wore it out to a day by the pool in Hawaii. Well...Got back to the room after a pool day and noticed HUGE blue/black transfers all along where the should straps hit. Had to scrub myself raw to get them off. Figured I just didn't wash it enough. I washed it again upon returning home, then wore it as a cover up at a family pool party. Another round of scrubbing off blue/black marks. Just beware, if you're planning on actually swimming in the swimsuit that this is covering up, you're gonna have a bad time."
2.0,"I bought these socks because I was on a budget. I'm a new RN and I'm on my feet most of my 12 hour shift. These socks are not compression socks unless you have extremely large calves or swelling issues. I'm 5' 9&#34; 180, sz 10 shoe with 14&#34; calves. yeah my legs are kinda on the skinny side. The other problem was 2 of these pairs started to get holes on the first day before i had washed them, and I keep my toe nails trimmed well. Pedis once a month with my daughters! lol I wore them the 2nd week of my new job and after 2 hours I was constantly reaching down to pull these up. They felt like a 2 year old pair of cheap soccer socks that had been stretched out by wearing shin guards. The material is soft, but they feel very thin. The elasticity is very loose. Honestly I would score these 1 star for myself, but I think if you have circulation issues and large calves these may offer you some light compression, but I wouldn't trust the quality of the material to last long. The color selection was also nice if you like variety.<br />Pros-<br />inexpensive<br />variety of colors and designs<br />soft material<br />Cons-<br />NO compression for thin medium legs( some for Large or XL calves.<br />material ripped BEFORE washing 2 out of 6 pairs<br />thin materal"
2.0,The fabric has no give and I would need to buy 2 sizes bigger just to be able to get it on  and to fit the arms but then it is too baggy in other areas. Also the fabric does not breathe at all.
2.0,The slit was way higher and the fabric was too thin. Return.
2.0,Faded after first wear.
2.0,Had no idea they were so small...
2.0,Looked ok but made my nose super itchy and red. I've had my nose pierced for a few years. So must be cheap metal
2.0,"I am definitely a b cup and the b cup size was WAY too large for me & i kept having to push on my boobs so that they wouldn't stick. BUT, they do come in this super cute pink case which I can appreciate because it keeps them from sticking to anything else."
2.0,"These socks are just okay. I would not purchase them again. For their premium price they aren't much better than your typical hanes or dickies athletic stock. They also are a little short and barely go past my 8""work or hunting boots. The quality seems okay but if they shrink at all they will be too small."
2.0,"The material does not seem very good to protect head from sun. Its hard to see from pictures but if you feel it is just a thin layer, soft, not waterproof or a resistant material."
2.0,Bad quality very cheap
2.0,This would be cute if you didn't end up looking like a real mermaid was hanging from your neck.  Its gawdy and large.
2.0,Not compression socks!!! Cute print though.
2.0,"I needed a slip so I got one of the cheapest ones I could find. I went a size up (based on the size chart) and the slip definitely runs small but that's what I was expecting. It's fine for layering though and will help with sheer dresses.<br /><br />The quality of this garment is a whole other issue. It's VERY bad quality. The slip I received was not sewn properly and the lace trip had come undone. I decided it would be easier to mend than to return and repurchase. I also had to reinforce there the straps attach to the slip since that was also very poorly done and the fabric is quite thin. While I was at it, I sewed darts into the arm pits since the chest was slightly large and gaping. Unless you're comfortable altering or mending this item when it comes apart, I would recommend spending your hard earned money elsewhere.<br /><br />Vassarette, which is much better quality, has slips for a similar price."
2.0,It works fine but the color is just a wild blue....its not all attractive like the pictures.
2.0,Llegó sin baterías ...
2.0,It doesn't worked well with my kid's glasses. Not great to hold them up.
2.0,"These dresses are super comfy, but they are super thin, they stretch out very easily because of that. You can't put anything in the pockets because if you do the dress stretches out even more. They're just okay they're not great. I would not suggest buying them."
2.0,Medium is like an extra small. I waited forever for this shirt and I can't wear it .
2.0,3 sizes too big for my daughter who wears 5t clothing.
2.0,"I'm an older adult dancer with measurements of 5'2'', 36B bra, 125 lbs. I normally wear a 6 petite, and sometimes an 8 petite, in regular clothes.  I have been looking for a camisole leotard that has support and coverage through the chest. (I don't like the look of a bra showing and so don't want to wear a separate regular or sport bra with the camisole.) This leotard seemed like it would be perfect for me. I liked the feel of the material - very sturdy and would definitely hide the little bit of loose flab around my waist. Unfortunately, the torso on both the large and medium leotards was too long for me.  (The material is very tight through the waist, not easy to get on; there's no way I could have gotten into a small.) I wonder if this leotard works better on a curvier figure than mine, possibly a younger figure? I returned both leotards."
2.0,"Dress is ok. Definitely NOT like the picture. The skirt is not as full as it looks in the advertised picture & the inner lining of the skirt is shorter than the tulle.  So even though the tulle is a good length, it looks like my daughter is too tall for the dress because you can see the shorter lining through the tulle.  While it is technically my daughter's size (sleeves are good length),  it is poorly sewn so the bodice is bunchy/bulky/loose. We have to pin the bottom of the bodice for it to not look so baggy.<br />I wish Disney offered a blue Sleeping Beauty dress because their quality is better than this. Too bad because we were excited for this to come in the mail."
2.0,Nice design but very weird proportions.<br />I would buy it if we could have loose bottom and tight upper body😂<br />I m a small in my upper body and medium bottom.<br />Seemed more like a sack on me.<br />However the dress is cute
2.0,Order up one if you want it roomy
2.0,Not like the picture.  The material is very different and the sleeves don't look nice
2.0,This is not embroidered. The material is not like a sweatshirt.<br /><br />Misleading.
2.0,This suit was ill fitting and cheaply made.
2.0,I bought a size bigger then I am and it still didn't fit me or my daughter who is two sizes smaller than me. I was very disappointed.
2.0,Very cute. Did not receive most of the ones on the picture and was the main reason why I ordered. So disappointed
2.0,Fell apart about one week after getting it.
2.0,"I am a tall plus size woman. 6 ft tall and wear a size 15 so I went with a 3XL. I tried it on and it was kinda like the scene in the movie Tommy Boy when he jokingly put on his friends coat that was 10 sizes to small and he sings the little ""fat man in a little coat"" song!!! I am not exaggerating when I say it was like I put on a size small tube top!!!! They bottom hit me about right at the middle of my (not so hourglass) form.... so I would say about 4 inches from my underboob!!! would not even latch (unless it be at risk of ripping) I was so upset!!! I wear shape wear all the time and have never bought bigger than a XXL and then I wished I had ordered a size down!!! so unless you are one of those size 8-10 plus size I would not recommend even the 3XL!!!  you will be disappointed٫ own something you cannot wear unless you decide anorexia is in your future٫ and to be honest... crushes your confidence!!"
2.0,This is not a bad mask as far as the making of it. It is fine for covering mouth and nose of a child it is just too small for a woman. It also should be washed before using as it has a bad smell. I will keep it and find a family in my neighborhood that needs it.
2.0,"The toe thong was uncomfortable, due to the heel height all of the weight is to the front of your foot.  It becomes difficult to to walk in these shoes after wearing them for a short time.  Too much pressure in between your toes, and even though they are cute, it was not a good fitting sandal for me personally."
2.0,"This didn't work.  I bought it as a gift for my elderly mother, because she doesn't like too much underwire.  However, this had no support at all, so I returned it."
2.0,"Strap is to short. My arm is not that big, yet the band will only go in second hole. This watch needs a longer strap."
2.0,"The dress was cute and fit ok, but very flimsy material. I was afraid if I washed it once it may fall apart. Also very wrinkled when I received it smushed into a plastic bag and I'm not sure the wrinkles would come out. Not really what I expected in a summer dress.<br />The black t-shirt dress was too small and just didn't look good even if it did fit. I would not recommend either dress."
2.0,Shirt is very pretty to look at but the measurements aren't accurate.  Runs small and is very fragile.  Getting it on and off you must be very careful and it feels like it's trying to come apart.  Would definitely hand wash it keeping but I'm returning.
2.0,"I bought this watch because I love musical watches.  Unfortunately, the music on this one was not audible unless I put the watch face right in the outside of my ear....and then it was still so soft and off-key, I could not tell what it was playing.  What a shame.  ""You Are My Sunshine"" is one of my favorite songs....and one my cockatiel loves, too.  I could not return it because I couldn't get it back in the box.  I still have it, but it is difficult to read when the gold hands are on the gold pooh bear.  Just not worth the money, time, or effort at all."
2.0,I was very disappointed in the size. The picture was very deceiving.
2.0,Doesn't look as good in person
2.0,"Honestly, they break easily as you are putting them on. Not very sturdy.  I kept them because they're good just to have a backup."
2.0,"Cute, fits fine, but looks very cheap and cheaply made. Like a kids costume quality."
2.0,Fits weird. Doesn't wash well. Already donated.
2.0,"The interior is black, not silver as described. There was no checkbook cover included."
2.0,Very nice product but it said cotton and its polyester which baby cannot wear because of sensitive skin. To bad looks great.
2.0,"It is too close to Christmas to return this, otherwise I would. All of the white areas look more pink than white."
2.0,Ordered this dress in two different sizes. One for me and one for my friend. After looking at the sizing guide we ordered what we thought were the appropriate size. Both sizes you could almost fit two of us in them. Had to return both.
2.0,"It didn't look like what I expected.  It fit, but I don't like tight clothes.  Much too small for my taste.  I like a conservative fit. The dress didn't fit my taste very much either.  It wasn't what I expected."
2.0,"I love the leggings and the colors and everything but i’ve only had them for a couple weeks and they already have holes in them ): not squat proof at all not because they show through, but because i’m scared they’re going to rip."
2.0,"It's a great shirt, but before it was worn I washed it. After washing it I noticed that the letters are starting to lift. I'm afraid to wash it again. Because I fear the letters will start lifting and peeling more."
2.0,"The material feels and looks kind of cheap, and I discovered I don't care for a vertical bag."
2.0,I really didn't like this purse.  Somehow it looked cheap.  I returned it.
2.0,One of the bracelets was broken need to find a link and fix
2.0,"These would be better suited for children/teens as far as length. Most of the strands i have used this far, the findings have fallen off. The strands where findings have stayed on, work out ok. Cord is typical black satin jewelry cord. Probably will not purchase again if only because findings not being secure."
2.0,Button broke first time trying them on it is not a size 34 like stated I wear jeans that are size 34 everyday and the button never breaks!
2.0,Material is thin & it runs a size small IMO. Probably wouldn’t buy again.
2.0,"I have a bi-fold wallet, larger than average. This insert is too large for my wallet. Maybe I need to get a 'hipster' wallet...."
2.0,"Very disappointed with fabric, rough, not silky and not good stretch. Loved the print, but product quality is poor overall."
2.0,"This dress was HUGE!  I normally wear an XL, could have gotten a M in this."
2.0,Very thin. Not as advertised.
2.0,The item was too small as stated above
2.0,This thing should come with instructions to show th  we right and wrong way to wear it. I couldn’t figure it out so I wear it as a regular ring and I always get compliments on it
2.0,"The hat came all folded up, and the creases would not come out."
2.0,"I love the look of these earrings...but I cannot wear them because the posts are too thick.  I could get an earring into one of my ears, but trying the other one caused way too much pain.  I cleaned them and had my daughter try, but they did not fit in either of her ears.  I'm not sure why they made the posts so thick and I wish they had not so I could wear these."
2.0,I really like the size and solar function of this watch. It gets 2 stars because I jumped in the pool and now it doesn't work because it is full of water. I guess you get what you pay for.
2.0,The quality of sweater is very low. The middle pocket on the tummy sits very awkwardly and has a lot of extra material below it. I was very excited for it still wearable but sheds so much so beware if you wear black or white under it. I wouldn’t buy it again tbh
2.0,This isn’t a slouch hat like in the picture. It is very small for an adult. Maybe a child would fit into it better.
2.0,This shirt was extremely small and not exactly what I had in mind. Very short !
2.0,"The material is comfortable, but it fits extremely big."
2.0,This hat is much smaller than the picture shows.
2.0,"Bough a 2nd pair, thought maybe the first pair was defective.  Seems to be a design flaw, though.  The sole squeaks loudly with every step.  Wast of hard earned money.  Big disappointment, they are comfortable, too!"
2.0,Waaaaaaaaay too small especially in the calves. Originally bought for my boyfriend but I could barely even squeeze into them
2.0,"Fit well and as expected, but I was sent the wrong pair."
2.0,The pin which holds the back lace comes of easily destroying the clog’s usage. That’s a single point of failure for this otherwise crocs lookalike
2.0,Material feels flimsy and that the lace will tear if it gets caught in a breeze.<br />Not that flow-y fabric was kinda hoping for a spandex/chiffon.  Its more stiff cotton and it ONLY looks good if you have your arms down like presented in this photo.
2.0,Really was not a fan.  The fabric is like a thin bathing suit material that clings to all the wrong places-not flattering at all.  I'm also 5'4&#34; and the shirt was too short on me (I prefer them to go past my hip bones).
2.0,I read the questions and answers from customers to the company and the company responded that these are very true to their sizes I still ordered a size bigger and they still don’t fit !  They are nice material I was excited about them coming but I can’t even try them on !
2.0,I thought they would be a little bit thicker material. And they are not very comfortable to wear. The masks seems to also be very large for my face
2.0,I really wanted to like this dress but after trying it on the fit was just all wrong in the wrong places. This style is meant for an older person (I’m mid 30s) but what sealed the deal for me to return was when I saw a grandmotherly type wear this dress. It hangs too long and no shape despite the a line cut. It feels like dressing in empire Bodice with tons of fabric hanging down. Unflattering.
2.0,Doesn't  fit hand
2.0,They're huge!!!! My daughter is a solid size 4.... these are larger than most of her size 5 toddler shoes. What a waste! I needed shoes that would actually fit.... not sit in the closet collecting dust. Bummer. Returning them.
2.0,"I was super excited to try these after reading such great reviews. I got my first pair, wore them twice and enjoyed them but noticed that the back seam was unraveling. I got in touch with Amazon and returned and replaced the leggings. The SAME thing has happened with the second pair! Aside from that, they have been great but the end result of the unraveling could be a split right down the back!"
2.0,"Too small, came warped and flawed. Overall not impressed and disappointed 😕 Wish I could atleast exchange for a bigger size but company has not emailed me back"
2.0,"came apart at the seams, just like the previous one<br />and was never given a refund"
2.0,the seam in the crotch started to separate after only three wears
2.0,"No padding..very small, even when I got a size up"
2.0,One turned green on the second day of wear.
2.0,Mui elegante
2.0,Plastic that holds it together is bridle and broke quickly.
2.0,I am only up to a 6g and have already found that the tunnels that are in the 6g are actually not a set. One was a 6g while the other was an 8g. I looked over them all and there were no mixed pieces. I have 3 8g tunnels and only 1 6g tunnel
2.0,The material is funky and it is snug in the chest area
2.0,On this one you get what you pay for. Very inexpensive feel to this watch
2.0,Usually love Soda brand shoes but these were def not up to par. The seller is great it's just the product... They run a half size too big and most definitely slippery on the bottom. Very cheaply made.
2.0,Did not fit like I was expecting.
2.0,I specifically went up 1 size than I normally wear to ensure fit and its still way too small. If you order I recommend atleast 2 sizes bigger than normal.
2.0,"Too short. I wear medium sweatpants because I'm athletic and generally regarded as being in good shape so large wouldn't fit but probably would've been long enough. Medium sweatpants should be equivalent to a 34"" inseam"
2.0,"Don't order it if you have skinny wrists they are too big.  The band is flimsy too, I was scared my flex would fall out."
2.0,"can't put many bills in the zippered part, and it wouldn't stay shut."
2.0,They are still cute earrings it's just that there are a lot bigger than what they look like in the picture I wanted them to be kind of small
2.0,The band is too wide for the sz adjuster. It is very difficult to adjust while wearing.
2.0,Cool hat unfortunately it ripped bad on the first day I wore it on the boat fishing. Will just buy a cheap one at the store next time
2.0,This bra feels good except It stands out in the middle showing under clothes! The wires stick out in front
2.0,The dress fits more on the small side and the material isn't what the picture looks like.
2.0,"I am 5'5&#34; and weigh 125lbs. I ordered this bathing suit in a medium and the top is pretty similar to the one in the pic but the bottoms are completely different! The bottoms are just regular bottoms with two cut out sides, the don't go up at all to even a mid rise! Very disappointed"
2.0,Ordered 1.5 sizes larger than I typically wear and still had a side seen blow out within 5 minutes of wear
2.0,I bought these pajamas for my grandson who wears a size 8. I bought them a bigger size so he can grow in them. They are too small.
2.0,Bought these for my son for Christmas. He absolutely lives them. Only had them for 2 months and now only one shoe will charge. So I guess they are broken and of course it's too late to return them since the window to return was January 31st.
2.0,"Pretty and work as should to but do not last. After 10 month a marker on the face came off and was floating around, soon the time was off. Too bad, I liked it."
2.0,"I bought this costume because it looks perfect in the photo. However, when I received it I was disappointed:<br /><br />The jumpsuit is really nice, but a bit i'll fitting for a short person like me<br />The belt and ""holsters"" are held on by velcro and look very silly,<br />The belt is mant to be lopsided and even if you wear it straight, you have velcro spots showing<br />the hourglass belt buckle is plastic! (this I was really bummed out by)<br />My widows sting gloves we flat rather than rounded<br /><br />I ended up using the jumpsuit and buying holster and making a resin buckle<br /><br />This is a good jumping off point for a great costume but not worth the money at all."
2.0,Poor quality doesn’t have a adjustable strap or strap under chin.
2.0,The zipper only lasted for one week smh
2.0,"The leotard is cute, but the clasp on the back broke the first time I wore it since it is made of plastic.  Why take the time to sew a leotard only to use super cheap hardware."
2.0,The lenses are barely held in.  One is wiggling constantly.
2.0,"These shrunk after the first washing, very dissappointed!"
2.0,"it turned my finger green the day i got it. i wore for for maybe half an hour.<br />for $40 (which is the SALE price), i wish it would have lasted a few months.<br />very disappointed."
2.0,Ended up returning item. Bottom of the boot fell off after only a few weeks of light uses. I take back my 5 star rating to 2.1
2.0,"I don't like to give bad reviews but from the first moment I start using these bags they began to tear from the handles, and the same thing happened with all of them. I am sorry but I don't recommend this product."
2.0,"Cute shirt but definitely didn't fit, ugh ..... I bought my size which is a 2x and it was more like a large/XL. Wouldn't buy again even if I went up 2 our 3 sizes lol. I aint got time to be playing Russian roulette ."
2.0,"This is pretty, but the fabric is sheer and see-through.  It also smelled chemically.  I returned it."
2.0,"I have purchased three Tyler Rodan  purses in past when they were available at dept stores. This one ordered on line was right color, zippers worked well but lining inside shredded within three weeks. Not had that issue with others. Also leather finish started peeling away around edges. Very disappointed in the purse as color and style were just what I was looking for"
2.0,it looks solid and ok and I wish the stone was more sprinkle.. but I could not open it and put it on.  The clip is stuck and even my husband tried..  Requesting a refund now..
2.0,Nice shirt.  Size ordered for my husband was xxl it is really small.  Doesn't have typical Harley tag on inside of the shirt so I question whether it's genuine Harley clothing. Otherwise the shirt is decently made but I will probably wear it since it is so small
2.0,The dress is pretty but the material is disappointing and didn't accomplish the look I thought from what I saw online.  it does not flare out.
2.0,"The top part is falling down, almost like it was pressed down.  Won't stay up.  Doesn't look good on me.  I have much older/fatter arms than the model.  I would recommend this to the young folks, maybe?  Too late, for me...  50+"
2.0,The description for this item states that this is a professional reproduction of a rare/hard to find poster and I agree with this statement however I do believe that the description or at least the image should make it known that the poster they used to make these reproductions from has folding/crease damage (I put a picture of it below). It is not terrible and I will not be looking to return the item but I do feel this is something a customer should be aware of before purchasing. I do like the poster and probably still would have purchased it even if the seller was up front about the quality.<br /><br />*Note there is no actual creasing damage it is in the image itself because these are copies of a poster with creasing damage.
2.0,Got this for my girl. It broke in a day or two of use. Got what I paid for I guess.
2.0,"It would have been nice if this bendable piece of metal had been shipped inside of a box, instead of a bag!!!!"
2.0,These are SO CUTE but they run AT LEAST two sizes too small. And my best guess is that these will shrink when washed too.
2.0,Far too huge for a child
2.0,"This one doesn't show that there are bust darts, which greatly reduce the size.  Beautiful material, odd fit."
2.0,Un poco larga
2.0,material was flimsy and the armhole area gapped in a sloppy way.
2.0,The shirt is a very thin cotton and it runs at least 2 sizes smaller than the size.
2.0,The rubber strap already started to tear after only a week of use.
2.0,"eh - weird texture to the fabric... not a fan - and they will not stay rolled..... soo short gals, not for you!"
2.0,The heels of the socks didn't fit well and rolled down inside my shoes and very thin material.
2.0,Three sets were different sizes. Love the ones that fit.. but annoying that all the reviews mention it.. but I took the risk anyway. Silly me
2.0,I sized you based on reviews. And could have went up another one too. They roll of to tight. And are basically see through. Not great. I’m normally an XL. I got a 2x
2.0,Very thin and see-through.  Material appears cheap.  Fit large.  Returned right away.  Would not recommend
2.0,Not as pictured. Wide and long and ill fitted.
2.0,It’s too small for my head and I can’t used it. What a waste of money
2.0,This shirt is in the trash. Needs to be about 3 -4 inches longer....
2.0,"Super small, like they are made for a kid. Cute though. Unless you are a tiny adult, I’d pass."
2.0,"I knew they would be small, but wow--these earrings are SO tiny! It's difficult to see the stripes in the rainbow, and the ""gems' are invisible. If my granddaughter dropped them on the carpet, we'd never find them."
2.0,I have to stop mid-swim to wipe the inside of these goggles.
2.0,"I have arthritis and a small wrist.  When I adjusted the band for the proper length, it was far too hard to get over my hand.  While it does stretch to do that, by the time I got it to my wrist it had stretched out and was too loose on my arm for my watch.  It is difficult to try to adjust while wearing so I had to take it off the readjust and then it was still stretched out too loose afterwards. The colors are very pleasant even so.  My hands are not swollen but they are sensitive so I returned them and got the magnetic ones."
2.0,"update: I've worn these less than 10 times and there is now a run in the fabric right next to the butt seam. pretty disappointing since they were becoming some of my go-to leggings, and now I can't wear them in public without something covering my butt.<br /><br />fit well and are flattering. my only issue is that the top can roll down, not sure if that's a size thing, or a style thing, but they're great regardless."
2.0,"Very cute, but the straps are much thicker in real life that I had pictured.  They are so big around I can't fit both onto my shoulder, so they kept rolling off.  The bag is really big, so you need to be able to carry it over a shoulder. Had to return."
2.0,Definitely not as shown. Ordered due to the color was supposed to be green. These are more of a rainbow like color. These lenses are easy to install and fit perfectly for the Oakley turbine rotor frames. Also visual clarity is not bad. Comparable to the original lenses that came with the original oakleys.Color wise not as advertised which is the reason for the 2 stars.
2.0,"The fit on the dress wasn’t too terrible and it comes in a T-Shirt type material so it’s fairly comfortable. My issue with the dress is that there is not a stitch in the front slit on the dress so when I walk or sit, I have the chance to flash EVERYONE around me. Wearing shorts underneath to prevent this isn’t a great option because lines are very obvious.<br />Overall, the dress would be cute if I could actually wear it, but I’m too scared."
2.0,Cheap cheap cheap! Definitely get what you pay for
2.0,Too big for my face. Returned.
2.0,I wouldn’t buy this with the expectation of it lasting. I paid $20 for this and it really is poorly constructed. There were pieces showing throw the stitching that was a careless mistake. It won’t last but it is roomy and comfortable. I bought a 3x and it’s more than generous in sizing.
2.0,Def not real silver.... Turned orange a week in.
2.0,"It kinda works, but is very poor quality. It was actually broken when I got it and I had to fix it for it to work."
2.0,The design needs to be modified. When the buckle is on the belt it's impossible to fit it through loops on pants. You have to take it apart every time you change pants.
2.0,It’s not exactly pictured as far as lengths in sleeves or bottom
2.0,"Super cute, but couldn’t get rid of wrinkles. It broke my heart to send this top back but I knew I would be wearing this blouse with all the wrinkles."
2.0,Is a little too square but cute. 2 stars for this shirt. Quality so so.
2.0,Thin see-through material. Wrinkles easily.
2.0,"I bought one in each color that these came in. I usually wear a large or xtra large. I’m pretty much going to have to find some giants to give these shirts to. They fit so weird. The chest fits fine, but the sleeve length is ridiculous. Might as well be a 3/4 length sleeve even on the large. They look great otherwise as far as the design and feel goes. Just very strange on the sizing."
2.0,"I am an xsmall or small in most tops. I bought this in a small. The top runs really small - the sleeves are too short, the shoulders are too tight, and the boat neck collar rides up too high in the front and back. I can wear it with something over it, but I guess this is one of those scenarios where you get what you pay for. Also, apparently you can’t return it."
2.0,"Ok, colors gray,<br />PINK"
2.0,"This dress is cute on… from the front. When I tried it on, it didn’t feel as loose and flowy as I was expecting. I took a look at the rear view and saw why. The front has three tiered sections and the back only has two. The back is missing the middle tier and just hangs like a bag from the upper gathered seam at the shoulder blades  to the lower one which is right below my butt. It is a very odd and unflattering  silhouette in the back. The fabric is labeled cotton and flax and I think that’s accurate. It’s lightweight and quite see-thru.  It has pockets which is great, but the mismatched front/back is a deal breaker for me."
2.0,Too small doesn't look like the size when you finally get it in the mail very smal
2.0,Very pretty - but it broke after I took it out the first time.
2.0,shirt was looking great on me but ist time i wore it at a party the back tear
2.0,Not true to size and also it’s like a tighter shirt that hugs you I prefer loose
2.0,It was tight and short
2.0,"I cannot recommend this shirt,  other than to say that the fabric is extremely soft and comfortable.  I would like to have a shirt made of this fabric in a more attractive style.  I also love the redwine color that I chose.  The front knot feature is just not attractive."
2.0,Husband hates them. Once they stretch a bit everything falls out lol. Maybe I ordered to large I dunno. The material is very baggy and bunches up in the wrong places.
2.0,You get what you pay for.  This doesn't look as cute as it does in the picture.  It looks more like 99 cent store jewelry.
2.0,"I am tall and thin and based on the description of this product, I figured a large would fit me well. They claim it runs small. I must say it does no such thing. I've ordered similar items to this and have been more than pleased with the sizing. However this is far too wide and short in the arms. Don't love the fabric either, kinda like a wind breaker. Seems like false advertisement."
2.0,"These are not like the reusable bags from the Disney store which I've had for 15 years. The ones I got from Disney are made from recycled plastic (top, sides, and bottoms).<br />These bags have the cheap fabric bottoms like the shopping bags at the grocery store which rip and tear after a month or two.<br />If using as a one time gift bag it's cute, but not good for daily shopping."
2.0,"As others have said, top is good but bottoms are horrible. I can't think of a body shape where the bottom would fit appropriately."
2.0,"Highy unsatified, receiever my order and only the skirt was in the package....."
2.0,"Cute but the arm won't stay connected, the it fall out if you touch it, by checking to be sure it's still there."
2.0,Tight fit. Zipper doesn't work all the way on one shoe.
2.0,Good product but definitely not the size of an XL. Way too small.
2.0,"Im only giving it 2 stars because one of them broke as i took it out of the little ziplock bag, there other’s are fine."
2.0,"It was nice, until it was washed and fell apart."
2.0,"I would give this item 5 stars because i love it and its good quality, but I only received half of my order. The description said 20 piece and I only received 10, im so disappointed i was so excited for these. I wish there was a way to reach the seller to let them know but I can't seem to find a way to."
2.0,"I am kind of disappointed with this piece of jewellery the Byzantine chain is a beautiful thing however as you can see in the picture below There is a kink in this chain it came to me just like this I had my boyfriend examine it and there are links that are not attached<br /> I worry about it breaking at this point where the links are not attached properly<br /> I grew up in a jewellery business and owned one myself for several years<br /> I understand the chain is usually made in extremely long lengths yards of it<br /> Then it is cut to the length needed for the necklace bracelet etc the ends in findings are then attached to complete the product<br /> It appears someone got to the end of this chain in decided to add an inch manually and then add the ends in findings to this change<br /> I can see this happening in some Chinese sweat shop but not in Italian jewellery<br /> I paid the extra money for the extra Quality Inn expected it to be of the utmost quality in careful assembly<br /> I had intended on buying a matching but slightly thicker 16"" choker necklace to go along with this bracelet but have decided against purchasing anything else by this company because of the lack of care in the creation of this piece<br /> I am currently still wearing it however I worry that it will break on me anytime<br /> The chances of this happening are probably wanted a 100 or less to other pieces of jewellery but I would definitely say that this was the end of a piece of Byzantine Jean where they added a small amount to cut corners and price point by using scrap leftovers<br /> Quality control should never have let this piece out on the market<br /> I bought this to be a daily where peace because I absolutely love this type of c Jean<br /> I was hoping to have it for a very long time in a daily worry about it breaking<br /> For the moment it is still holding up<br /> But it does have a weakest link"
2.0,I liked the cut and style but hate the print and wish they made it in different choices bc this one I looked like a ladybug!
2.0,The up the butt part is to thick and front is super low. And yes I know its a brazillan and it's supposed to be small & by no means am I fat. Just a bad fitting product. A G string is much more comfortable.
2.0,its alot smaller then i thought
2.0,Don't order if you are tall. Crappy product.
2.0,"The belt was OK - however the color some lighter than it appears in the screen. What I could not stand was the strong ugly smell it had. It seems this product was saved in a place with a lot of humidity and I am an allergic person, same my family, so I returned it."
2.0,Priced right. Low quality never would order again and it's going to the good will.
2.0,I sent It back because it was way too long! I could almost wrap it around my wrist 3 times! But color and quality looked good.
2.0,"Disappointed. Fabric has a sheen to it, made me feel like I was wearing opaque shiny tights. Also didn’t like the fabric. It was thinner than I expected and felt cheap. I’ve found way higher quality leggings on Amazon for the same price. Returning these!"
2.0,Fabric looks cheap and it was too big.
2.0,"I don't know how many rings they think this thing can hold...maybe one or two that weigh absolutely nothing.  The thing is about 2 inches tall and has no weight to it at all.  I would not recommend as a ring holder and would best be served for display in a shadow box or something.  I was giving this as a gift and was very disappointed at it's size and weight.  Too bad because she liked the figure itself, but it is not useful as it is suggested."
2.0,Unfortunately the posts twisted out of shape when trying to put on a variety of backings- none of which would go over the posts. Couldn't wear. What a shame. Pretty colors and really tiny.
2.0,I like the looks of the band and ordered a small. I have a small wrist but these bands in a small might fit a small child! So disappointed my suggestion be what size wrist these fit
2.0,"The wallet is ok. It was wrapped in a protective plastic film. However, inside this plastic, the wallet was covered in mildew. How disgusting."
2.0,So tiny. Smaller than expected so I had to return it
2.0,"I loved the color and the material, but the width of the sleeves is very narrow and there is no stretch to the fabric, so I ended up cutting off the sleeves and wearing it as a summer top."
2.0,These are really cute but they're made of itchy cloth so they're hard to wear comfortably.  I still love them but I just don't wear them that often.
2.0,It's a pretty mask but very thin polyester type material. Also too small for me and I have a small face. it pulls across my nose and gaps around it.  If this was a child sized mask I must have missed it in the description. The chemical smell out of the bag was very strong. Better once it aired out. I haven't washed it yet since it doesn't fit.  I should have returned it but will probably find someone who wants it.  The design was nice and was the reason I bought it.
2.0,I purchased one set that had to be replaced due to the eye broken in the package the replacement arrived in the same condition
2.0,"Not for regular torso, a bit short. The material slides the shirt up words as you work out."
2.0,The product I received is not as pictured.  I received a white crystal.  Disappointing!
2.0,Hola me quedo muy pequeño lo voy a devolver
2.0,Pretty ring but tarnished after a few months of wearing.
2.0,"The model looks way cuter than I did. I was OK, not great. the material also isn't that great."
2.0,way to small had to return it
2.0,The material was very thin and cheap the bow isn’t as large as pictured either.
2.0,The dress was too large and fitting was not good.  Dress material was good.
2.0,It broke after two wearings
2.0,a bit cheesy and doesn't belong with jeans
2.0,"This listing is very deceiving. The pictured dress with the model is not the dress you are getting. They stole this photo from another dress listing (that is more expensive) and is actually 7 layers of tule. This dress only has 2 layers of tule.<br />With all that being said, this dress is still very beautiful. I was definitely hoping for seven layers of tule as the model is definitely wearing that version.<br />So,  if you don’t want to pay for the more expensive version of this dress that has seven layers, then go ahead and purchase this item. The dress is still very beautiful! But if you are looking for that WOW factor of super fluffy poofy princess dress, you will be disappointed.<br /> I contacted Amazon about the deceptive photo. Not sure what they will do about it. But they did give me a some Amazon credit$ because of the issue. Thank you Amazon!<br /> If the advertising had not been deceptive, I would have given this listing five stars."
2.0,"Based on the consistent 4.5 stars these glasses received, as well as the extremely low price, I figured they would be worth a try.  I purchased these for my daily 1 mile walk to work, which in Minnesota requires that all skin be covered on the coldest Dec-Feb days.  Within 1 minute or so having these on, they started to fog up, and by 5 minutes, my vision was significantly impaired due to fog and condensation.  The foam used to seal the glasses against your face is very low quality and quite thin compared to what you find on even mid-level skiing goggles, and is not comfortable - I would imagine that attempting to ski with these for a full day would be unbearable.  Finally, the arch for the nose and the distance between the top of the frame and the nose cutout are both incorrect and prevent the goggles from sitting on the face properly.  I have owned many pairs of ski goggles over the years, and none of them have had this problem.<br /><br />Overall, these ski goggles do not appear to be well designed, they do not seal well, and they are prone to fogging.  I gave them 2 stars instead of 1 because of the ultra-low price.  That being said, I will be returning them immediately and buying a proper pair from Scott or Smith."
2.0,Blouse is crepe not chiffon. Disappointing.
2.0,It looked cute and everything but I thought it would look more curled on my nose like a real one but this one just went straight down
2.0,"Product fit fine , but the suspenders broke as soon as I put it on the baby . I was not able to take photos at the photo shoot with the whole outfit . I would not buy this product again ."
2.0,"Not the expected color. Much darker & the red print is not vibrant,more like a funky dark pink. Very thin material. Normally wear a large, ordered 1 size up, really could have gone up 2 sizes. Glad I only paid $9."
2.0,I had gotten a glove like this from my physical therapist so when it wore out I purchased this glove.  I was happy when it arrived as it looked just like my old one. I purchased size small and it fit perfectly. However after only a few wears it was no longer tight and was starting to fray.  I don't even bother wearing it anymore.  I will not be purchasing this item again.
2.0,"Looked nice and shielded my son from the sun for a few weeks...and then it started shrinking. At first it was just from getting wet. Then we actually washed it, and it became unwearable. Probably shrank by 20%. Don't think it's worth it."
2.0,I've had it just over a month and today it snagged on a piece of tape when I was opening a box and the small clasp that connects to the lanyard broke. And I mean it completely came apart. The price is not worth a month of use.
2.0,Good material but huge. I ordered a small. I’m 5”3 154 lbs. makes me look super fat. Did not like it. Will return it.
2.0,i find the glasse very stiff iam afraid to brake them i was expected something a better nice quality sory
2.0,"They work, just break really easy. I'm glad I got the 12 pack. We have gone threw 6 for my three kids."
2.0,Very stiff and scratchy fabric
2.0,"I really wanted this dress for church. Honestly, I couldn't do anything with it. The size said 2X. It fit like a medium."
2.0,Way off on the size. Much smaller than I expected.
2.0,Beautiful jumpsuit but was a bit big
2.0,Top cross was way too high<br />Lower didn’t come close to fitting 38ddd
2.0,"Although my son loves this robe I feel that it is not that great.  It is rather small for its size so I would definitely size up one or two sizes.  It is a soft robe but it is not as soft as you would imagine a a bath robe to be, it almost feels more like a bath towel than a robe.  This is also not a long robe, it hits my son at about thigh height.  Maybe if I would have sized up it would have been longer on him.  It does have a cute design on it and I do love the hood.  I wish there were more sizes in this to be able to exchange for a larger size."
2.0,"Big, thin and see through"
2.0,I lasted about 15 minutes and had to take it off.  The material is breathable but makes you extremely warm.  I couldn’t stand it.
2.0,XL fits like a small/ medium. Very thin.. cheap product.
2.0,These are HUGE. Made well but am a small person. Entered 1 1/2&#34; earrings & these popped up. I should have read more carefully. Sent an email to seller to try to return them but no response.
2.0,"Was not expecting ""Wow!"", for the price but seriously I think this came out of a flea market."
2.0,Didn't realize they were so small
2.0,"this is an asian style fit so if you wear a small order a large, too bad asian sizes don't go up to XXL"
2.0,"Feels like my brittle finger nails would puncture thru these just trying to get them on. Do not like the feel of these. Also, mine came with 3 gray scratches on the top of the pants. Very disappointing. Shipping back."
2.0,"I really wanted to love these because they are the perfect style with the soft case and the squeeze style hinges, but the quality is pretty poor. The stitching was coming out all over the black case upon arrival and you can feel they are made of very cheap vinyl sewn together at a rapid pace. If they wanted to make them as just a cheap-style case, they should be selling them for about $2/ea, not $6/ea. I have found MUCH nicer real leather ones at Nordstrom Rack for $9.95 before sometimes. I'll have to keep trying there in the future if I want quality."
2.0,bought these mainly for the biggest hoop and it came broken
2.0,Too small to wear comfortably out. Plus the sequins just trying them on kept getting hung and pulled off on the legs. There was not really a waistline either so the pants just didn't want to sit right at the top. Not for me. Sent back.
2.0,The vibration feature doesn't work any more. That was the only reason I bought it. Keeps time well.
2.0,"It's cute, but broke the second time I wore it :("
2.0,Both times I received this item it was defected. The first one was ripped and the second one was missing the straps on the left leg.. Well I guess you get what you pay for.
2.0,"I loved the look of this shirt and my husband loves Marvin the Martian, but it shrunk so badly after 1 wash that it is unwearable. I had to return it."
2.0,"I picked these up because i thought it would help with posture and slimming. Product does neither infact although it is tight for compression, it is too ahort so i have a hard time keeping this tucked in."
2.0,Product is very snug. Fits more like a medium than extra large.
2.0,"While it is a beautiful dress, the material is flimsy. It ripped near the key hole in the back. Tried to see it but ripped again. It may be that I am busty and not best material for curvy gals."
2.0,"Very cute, but very small. (I'm a size 2, and the medium is still small on me!) I just received this and paid extra to get it in time for Santacon. Unfortunately, it came with red dye that had bled into the white trim of the hood, and the zipper in the front is partially detached. Very disappointing!!"
2.0,"I originally purchased this watch (but with the black face) about eight months ago. Unfortunately, I managed to lose it over winter break going between airports, so I decided to purchase another one since I enjoyed the look, feel, and style of this watch. I got so many compliments on it I had originally planned to purchase several more to use as gifts.<br /><br />Interestingly enough, after this watch arrived I could not quite figure out why it seemed to somehow feel cheaper. Then it dawned on me – the band was much lighter than my first. Although the watch still looks just as pretty as before, the mesh band now feels much cheaper and “breakable” now. I’m very much disappointed in the changes they’ve made to the mesh strap as it really does make the watch feel much cheaper and off-brand and would recommend for people to look into a different style.<br /><br />Had I known this beforehand I would’ve never bought this watch again, as I appreciated the sense of durability and sturdiness it once had— especially given that it’s now more expensive. I’m a small business owner so I understand when you need to make price adjustments. But I very much disagree with increasing the price and decreasing the quality."
2.0,update brown crust on ears after a while don’t buy
2.0,"I was a disappointed in this product. The picture looks adorable and you say to yourself ""i have to have them.""<br />I thought they where pricey. I ordered them anyway. Not comfortable and the high top if the sneaker was not so high, so you can feel the bend of the shoe when you walk. I wear them to work (not much walking) I'll keep them, but next time definitely try on in the store and not order online."
2.0,To a little big. Bottoms a little small.
2.0,"My brother loved it and it was pretty, but it fell apart within a couple of months."
2.0,"The quality of this sweater was good but the color was off!!  I ordered the cream and it was closer to yellow.  I did not like how it fit me; the medium (my usual size in this type of garment) was not flattering to my 5’4”, 130 lbs body frame."
2.0,This hat is not an adult sized hat. The sticker on the hat says adult but it was too small for my head. I have a normal sized head and all hats fit me. Some are even too big. Usually I have to tighten hats to the smallest notch to fit. Even when this was as big as it could be it was still too small. I’m convinced it’s youth sized. It’s too bad because otherwise it’s so cute. Hope the seller can send an adult sized one instead.
2.0,I got these for my 7 year old when she went back to in-person classes. She was able to manipulate the clasp to get her mask on it and used them for several weeks. She complained that the cord in the back long enough so that when she sat back in her chair the flower bead stopper on the end of the cord would dig into her back and hurt her a lot. My complaint is that some of the black clasps that connect to the face mask have already fallen off. They were cute but not functional or durable against daily kid use.
2.0,"The color is beautiful but it has what looks like water spots on it, like it was used and repackaged."
2.0,"beware that this dress was see-through entirely, didnt give it a one because it does look like the photo, just much thinner material resulting in a sheer coverage"
2.0,very thin. need to wear shirt under it.
2.0,"I've been enthused by Reebok's reemergence into actual running shoe's. I picked up some Harmony racer's and LOVE them, I will actually train in them from time to time (and race!!). I liked them so much I got a pair of harmony Road 2's, a slightly clunky, not fast, well fitted trainer  that I also like to wear when I'm not running. So much so I decided to try the Float Ride so I have a better rotation of trainer's. I saw a great review and a not so great review but due to my well received Harmony's thought these would fit in.<br />NOPE!!!<br />The shoe is beautiful (all white my pair), really nice flexing material in the upper, sock like, with no lace tongue. An odd lacing cage that seemed OK, and a strange deep heel cup. These last two feature's were what buried the show for me. I need a very snug heel, I have learned to take advantage of any extra lacing hole's near the top of the shoe, sometime's called ""heel-lock"", and if not there I would punch a extra hole myself. I keep the lower lace's as loose as possible without being sloppy to help with foot swelling and the heel-lock holes on top to keep the heel in place. The FloatRide's cage allow's for no heel-lock set up,and the deep heel cup would slip off my heel each step giving me a sensation of running in a clog. I tried to tighten the lace's to MAX, but the cage allow's any pulling on top to be transmitted all the way down the lace and pinch my forefoot and across the top.  The sole of the shoe had a rather court shoe like feel that might have mitigated with time and break in, but for me they kinda flopped down each step as though I was running in flipper's. Yeah, a clog like flipper!! I actually made it about a mile, pulled them off, ran home barefoot.<br /><br />Now, to be fair I like a very neutral shoe, with moccasin like snugness that lets my foot go where it want's. I once ran 3 mile's in some well worn in Tom's, could've used more padding but very very comfortable.<br /><br />Anyway, I've run in Reebok's since the late 70's and do like the Harmony's and hope for more great offering's from them in the future."
2.0,"I gave the item 2 stars only because the color was accurate,  I was able to return it easily and the product packaging was excellent. Other than this, I was extremely disappointed with the purchase. Thank goodness I opened the box, removed the wrapping and looked at the shawl before giving it as a gift. It is so nicely packaged, I almost did not, as I would not have been able to repackage it in the same manner. The first thing I noticed was the horrible odor. It smelled as if it had been stored in moth balls! This, alone, was reason enough to return the item. The odor was extremely strong.  The material was very stiff, not soft at all, and reminded me of the stiff blankets you would find for sale in a gas station. There was no movement to the material once I tried it on. It was also quite large. I wear an XLG and this shawl was too big, even for me. It felt as if I had on a stiff, heavy blanket.<br />I would not purchase this item again and am so thankful I opened the box prior to giving it as a gift. I was happy with the return process though, which was quick and trouble-free."
2.0,Where’s my fur on my hood? Also this makes me look like a bell. It adds this weird hip thing. Feels well made and warm. Much shorter than the pics make you believe. Overall disappointing.
2.0,"Product does not appear as it did in pictures, product was comfortable but not as quality, would like trade in for one in picture, would like more color"
2.0,"Size: 1-star<br />I knew It was a risk buying a ""large"" mask from China. I'm 6'1"" and 220ish pounds and this large mask pulled my ears down and out like dumbo. I'm sure it will fit an average sized male quite well but doesn't correspond to the OSHA size standards.<br /><br />Material: 3-star<br />Seems to be pretty decently stitched together with average materials. The color was really nice. The exhaust/exhale vents are a little cheap and mine fell out a couple of times after I made sure to line up the teeth and follow the arrows."
2.0,"I wear XL/size 14 and ordered size XL.  It was nowhere near fitting on my chest (40D) or arms.  The pants did fit, but were not comfortable for sweats.  The print was not very clear and seemed like it would wash/chip off with the first washing.  I returned the product/free return with no trouble and got a full refund."
2.0,This band was everything I had hoped.  But after about 6 weeks one of the buttons fell off.
2.0,The pendent is nice the chai is a cheap<br />Piece of garbage. Going back
2.0,I like the slink design and texture of the wallet purse. It's a pretty wallet. It could be functional if it zips properly. I disliked the fact the some of the teeth in the zipper does not catch so it doesn't properly close. I have to slowly zip it (and I do mean SLOWLY ZIP IT to make it close on all sides.
2.0,"I returned this because the sizing was so strange.  I ordered a Large, but the shoulders fit like an XL and the body fit like a medium.  I was expecting a tunic style like the photo.  Needless to say there was no way it was ever going to fit with that kind of sizing."
2.0,"I love the look, fit and comfort of this shoe, but within two wears, a bubble developed under the material of the heel.  These shoes are too expensive to have something that cheap happen that quick.  I have loved Cole Haan shoes in the past so maybe it is a problem with this model.  I will be returning these unfortunately."
2.0,"so I usually wear a size small. I ordered an extra small because I wanted a tighter fit , however, the extra small was big on me. I'm glad I didn't order my usual size. if you are a smaller size person, don't count on these being form fitting at all. not only was it loose, but short as well."
2.0,Cute but to small and snagged first time I tried it on
2.0,Beautiful...but too small and too short length!
2.0,This dress is way to big and the material has a very artificial feel. I will not be wearing this dress.
2.0,"I love the concept, but this particular pair does not work very well for me for a couple of reasons:<br /><br />1. I have very thick calves and, as such, these have a hard time getting enough purchase to hold my socks up<br />2. One of the suspender clips came to me slightly warped so that it flies apart if i'm not careful when un-latching it. Not a deal-breaker so I didn't send them back, but a bit annoying nonetheless."
2.0,It's the size I thought it would be but the way it rides your shoulders feels funny
2.0,Doesn’t stay in place. Can only be used as bra pads
2.0,This product is the material of a fruit of the loom under shirt and is completely see through. The size however was as expected and the style was cute it it were only a better material
2.0,I really wanted to love this skirt! First let me say it is gorgeous!! And the quality seems good. The main problem is the sizing. In most skirts I could get away with an xl. I got the biggest size in this skirt which was a 3x and it still didn’t fit!! Super bummed because like I said the skirt is gorgeous!!
2.0,Does not fit well. Material too thick which makes me  look like a lamp shade in it.
2.0,Beautiful but a little uncomfortable. It turned rusty in less than 6 weeks. Would be good for a wear once in a while & store in a jewelry box kind of item. I never took it off & it didn't stand up to that kind of wear.
2.0,"The material is very PJ like. Maybe I am too old for it but very nice on me. If you are hipster, it might work. I didn't like the material anyway but again maybe  am getting to ld for looking hip"
2.0,Run really small I can’t wear them
2.0,"Very thin, and there’s fuzz on the inside that is very irritating. I bought these during the height of the first wave when finding other options was near to impossible. There’s much better masks available now than this."
2.0,The top of the dress is way bigger than it should be. I ordered a Large and the top was like an XL and the rest of the dress was a large. It would if perfect except for that imperfection. It was an huge inconvenience for me to go looking for a dress last minute.
2.0,"What can I say? There was not one thing I liked about the fit or the material used for this sweater. That said, I guess it did kind of look like the picture. Came in VERY wrinkled, fit like a sack - with a neck opening big enough for Mr T."
2.0,"They fell apart on the first wear. I was able to fix and reattach, but after the third or fourth time it wasn’t worth it."
2.0,"I was surprised of the Horrible quality, cotton is very hard. I thought it would be as good quality as the Pijamas I ordered from them long time ago, Those I loved! and people ask me all the time were I got them. I still waiting for more undies with stripes and clouds hope those are nice. These are not just the style and size are very nice but not the fabric quality."
2.0,"I have no idea how to determine this for sure, but it definitely doesn’t feel like it has any spandex in it.  It feels exactly like several other 100% cotton shirts that I have.  It’s also interesting that there is another shirt available that is listed as 100% cotton and uses the same model and pictures.  There is a tag that says it is 5% spandex, but I am not convinced. As for sizing, I am 6’1” and 215lbs.  I bought a large and it is definitely tight like a muscle shirt is supposed to be but some might prefer it a little looser.  I do think it is too short though and wish it was a little longer."
2.0,The lettering is so messy....like wtf
2.0,I ordered this mask over other black masks because the photos made it look metallic and marbleized. Almost lacquered. However it's just a plain black plastic mask with gold features. If I knew it was the same as all the rest I would have picked a cheaper one.
2.0,"I normally wear XL in jackets/hoodies because they fit a little loose. However these run big so I'd suggest going a size down. However it is comfy & lightweight, I am 188lbs and 5'5 with DD & and XL was too big."
2.0,"I wore this dress for homecoming, and it is absolutely beautiful. The color, fabric, the way the chest is wired, just everything, the corset back made for a beautiful fit, and overall was super pleased with it and got a ton of compliments; until we started dancing. The strap is connected in the back by a little plastic ring, it snapped and the strap completely was disconnected from the back. The other side that didn’t break the adjustable piece in the back broke so it wouldn’t hold in place. Ended up wearing my dates jacket over to cover. Love the dress, but I struggled with it all night. For 73 dollars I spent I didn’t expect it to break in the first hour wearing it."
2.0,The material was itching and not soft.
2.0,The product review is misleading. I bought qty 2 because i needed 5 headbands. One picture shows an allotment of 3 headbands and it doesn’t state in the description how many. I thought it was a packet of 3 headbands.
2.0,"Although I can't determine if they're actually stainless steel, and haven't tested yet for magnetism, they are definitely far superior than any plastic stays I have ever used, and were relatively cheap for such an assortment of sizes. I was glad to find that the stays are quite smooth, and there are no burrs along the edges that could hook onto threads. However, the item did not come as described!<br /><br />The product came in used condition (fingerprint smears, small scratches, etc.). Additionally, there were two different styles of collar stays that were provided: 1) the smooth metal stays that are pictured in the description, and 2) very nice, dimpled metal collar stays. In fact, I would rather all the collar stays in the dimpled style — they're that nice — but if you order this product, there's really no guarantee what style you'll get. The included measuring tape looked old/used, but I needed one, so I'm not complaining.<br /><br />All of those things aside, my main gripe is that I was given an uneven amount of 2.5'' and 2.25'' stays. I have 1 less 2.5'' stay than should have been included, and 1 more 2.25'' stay than should have been included. Obviously I'm not going to need 3 pairs of stays at once (unless I'm lending them out), but if I ever misplace or damage stays, that's one full pair that I cannot use, as I'm missing the second piece of the pair!"
2.0,I loved the way these looked but when received they where extremely hard to bend to my face.  each time i touched them the crystals fell off as well.
2.0,They are very thin. Not recommended for elderly women that are always cold. They are also smaller than specified. Order 2 sizes larger for a good fit!!!!!!!!!!!
2.0,I bought two because I liked the styling.  The fabric is heavy and too springy and I believe will stretch.<br />A cotton poly fabric would be great!
2.0,The wigs are actually made out of cloth instead of plastic. The picture shows you what looks like a plastic set of wings. Since it want plastic new problems will come along. Inside of the cloth is this wire but the wire isn't that bendable.  Once it  is bent in a certain position it's really hard to get it out. You will have to lay something heavy on top of it to bend it out. Also at the end of them at the base was crooked on mine so when I put them on they are lopsided.  I don't know if this happened during shipment but it can't be fixed. It's still ok aside from it being lopsided.
2.0,"Cute bag and love the size, but the main zippers broke on it's first use!  Very cheaply made :("
2.0,Love the shirt and color but snug around the hips and too opened in the chest area. Have to wear a pin to hold shut not to expose your bra or chest.
2.0,"These are &#34;OK.&#34; I'm 5'1, and found them a little long, and, if I wear it with the zipper is on the inside, I find that the zipper really digs into my inner knee. I ended up wearing them with the zipper on the outside, but that's too challenging to zip up (I'm not a contortionist!), so I don't use the zipper. These have been retired to my drawer, in case of emergency.<br /><br />This is the second pair of zippered compression socks. The quality of these is much better than the other pair. But they don't work for me, so I'm sticking with pull-on compression socks!"
2.0,"The quality of the sewn leather and clasps are excellent, but the band is extremely stiff and doesn't have holes for smaller wrist."
2.0,The post said fleece lined definitely NOT fleece lined. Fit smaller than expected.
2.0,Scratch material and shrunk in the washer beyond destoyable
2.0,Good in the rain. Inside liner moves and makes them uncomfortable.
2.0,Its a nice design but poorly made. Ot doesn't fit the face well. It has open gaps on both sides of the face. Don't like it at all.
2.0,"The ring is beautiful but after a a week it snapped, so I can't wear it! I would have given it more stars but because of it breaking I can not."
2.0,Color was drab and darker then in picture...
2.0,"I suppose they are adequate ties for the price. The quality of the material was fair. Nice colors. But, the material was light in weight."
2.0,It broke after only 2 months!
2.0,Too tight around the arm cuffs and did not fit loosely around my shoulders.
2.0,"Beware!!! You do not get one of each color, instead you will get all the same color and at random. Thank goodness my daughter likes blue."
2.0,"the dress runs at least two sizes too small by the length. my daughter is a 5/6. this dress length was more like a shirt, ran like a 3/4. The material is extremely thin too, you would need to put a tee shirt underneath"
2.0,"Me gusto el vestido pero el color no tiene nada que ver con lo que me mandaron, me enviaron un color muy diferente que no me agrado."
2.0,"I wanted to like these socks so bad but I couldn't wear them for very long they were way too tight at the top and I have very thin legs. I even tried stretching them by leaving them over a large container, nope didn't work... so since I'd already worn them and tried to stretch them, I thew them away. Waste of money"
2.0,"its weights heavy, and always having pain in my breast so i stopped wearing it"
2.0,They were nice quality but the size is WAY off. I know you’re supposed to order a size or two up and they were still way too small. I wear a 9/10 and ordered a 14 and no way it was the size of a 14. They tell you it’s way too expensive to us to return (they don’t do free returns) so they’ll give you a $10 credit and you can give the pants to someone else. Huge disappointment.
2.0,"This is really cute, but it made my ear sore..."
2.0,I bought these because I wanted a dark purple but I got light purple between lilac and pink
2.0,"Quality of fabric was poor and very thin,"
2.0,These earrings look pretty in the picture but look very cheap in person.
2.0,Its not true to size..im very disappointed
2.0,"i thought i made a mistake in ordering the right size when i opened the package- the thing is huge!  i usually order a large in tops just because i like a baggy fit, but holy cow!  it is 44 inches across the chest, measured just under the arm holes, and 72 inches around by the time it reaches the bottom, wow.  that is NOT stretching it, just laid flat and measured.  the fabric is soft and silky, and it looks like the listing shows, but it is apparently hit or miss when it comes to the size you get.  way too big to ever wear.  fail."
2.0,It's ok but not great looking on plus sized girls as it shows every lump and has no control in the spandex.  Kind of light wearing uncomfortable tights.  There should be some support!
2.0,I give 2 stars because it fits as expected and is cute on. It is just such cheap fabric!! It literally feels like a swim top. I wouldn't recommend buying if you are expecting something of quality.
2.0,Cut very small.  Returned item.
2.0,"Doesn't fit as the measurements state.  We measured body and matched to chart and it was NOT EVEN close.  We thought maybe getting a smaller size might work, but the padding in the bust area was WAY too high!!"
2.0,Love my ring but just like  my blue stone one it tarnished very quickly
2.0,Wouldn't order again.
2.0,The design and material are nice but could not get the wrinkles out after 2 washings.<br />The color is more lilac<br />and dull definitaly not purple.
2.0,Loved the bands. But one came broken
2.0,One Size Fits All does not really fit all.... way too big.
2.0,This was a great watch band until the pin ripped out of the band where it connects to the watch. Until this point it was great unfortunately that only took a few months to happen. I could see after a year or more this happening but it's lifespan was too short for it to break in my opinion.
2.0,"Very pretty & colorful. I really like them, however one of the stones keeps falling out. Luckily I have been able to find it so far"
2.0,"Super cute in the photo, however it's very baggy--tons of material. I actually didn't even wear this dress in Hawaii, which is why I purchased it."
2.0,The sewn edges of where he clasp area is kind of hard and sometimes not comfortable
2.0,Not silhouetted. It's just a piece of fabric sewn into a rectangle.
2.0,The skirts okay. The top will never be worn by her. It's really short and reeeealllly wide. Fits horrible.
2.0,Not as cute as the picture.
2.0,Its so so
2.0,Tiny but usable. Had to reorder the right size for me. Kezef doesn't offer size choices on this order but does at website.
2.0,So the earrings are super cute but I'm very disappointed that they are two different colors! I have no idea how that happened one is gold and the other rose. It's a small difference but it ruined it for me. I noticed the difference as soon as I opened the bag. The rose also doesn't exactly match the picture. I'm overall pretty sad I was so excited!
2.0,The frame was bent and the noise support was not even so the glasses were on a slant plus on the end of the frame the white paint was chipping off
2.0,Actual charms breaks off super early.
2.0,"Cheap, returned them. Thin material and not dressy like at all. Looks like something you buy from the cheap stores at the mall that sell clothes for under $10"
2.0,"So the minute i opened this watch, i knew they only invested like 2 mil. in making it. They should have invested more. Then, that oyster the oyster was missing. I looked everywhere, and it was not there. Next lets talk price. This is way too cheap. I have millions laying around, and this piece of junk disappointed me. The paint job reminds me of my rump. i didn't sent my children to college because of this. Sure i have millions, but i dont waste money on them. I gave it 2 stars so i wouldn't make rolex sad. I got severely sick looking at it. I threw up 10000000000000000000000000000000000000000 times. In fact i have a guiness record. in fact it runined rolex stock."
2.0,"When I first received this band, my impression was that it was beautiful and well made. However, after a month of wear it began to break down. While I was walking down the road, the band fell off the watch which caused the back to shatter. It appeared that the connector piece had weakened over time. If you buy this, I would recommend to make sure it is secure when wearing the watch."
2.0,"I like it because it has flowers on it. But it doesn't look like in the picture. It is actually far away from the picture model. Starting by the fact that the sides are not open, and is shorter on the arms."
2.0,Nice looking socks - but the majority of them are tight at the top and cut off my circulation.  And some are hard to get on because there are so many threads on the inside of the sock.  Was very disappointed.
2.0,"Higher cut neck then I was expecting so I think that made me not like the dress from the start. Material was okay, colors were nice- length was longer than expected, looser in the waist, tight on the butt in spots so not sure if it was how it was sewn or what. I will try to find a belt to see if that will help complete the look but not sure if there is anything to make me wear it much from here."
2.0,"Great earrings, but I received two for the right ear and not one for each ear. Expected mirrored pieces and got two identical pieces so when I put them on, one is swooping up and the other swoops down and it doesn't look good."
2.0,"I love this pendant. Exactly as pictured. But I've been wearing it so often the pewter is wearing off on the reverse side, where it touches my skin. Just wish it was stainless steel, only reason I didn't give it five stars."
2.0,This ring is unusually tall perhaps it would blend in and look okay if you were wearing rings on all your other fingers as well. It's a chunky ring to begin with coupled with the fact but it's also very tall makes it look really odd by itself. Also the gemstone on mine was poorly cut and a little bit lopsided.
2.0,"Like the look of these, but the sole started separating and wrinkling after the first 2 weeks. Now every step is like walking on crinkled up paper. Really disappointed at the poor quality for the price."
2.0,Made really cheap and fell apart
2.0,"I received this winder for a Christmas present from my wife about two ears ago and it worked fine for about a year.  Then one winder stopped. Now a second has stopped.  The others don't turn on and off reliably.  This is same experience others have had.  I would have expected a better product from Brookstone. I write few reviews, but this product was disappointing."
2.0,I really liked the print and the design of the dress. But the dress does not have a lining at all. It's pretty much a see through dress all around. I tried it on with a black slip underneath but it was obvious as the slip was visible. The cost to get a lining for the whole dress was more expensive than the dress so I just had to return it as it was not worth it.
2.0,"Not worth the money, cheaply made…just sweep up your hair."
2.0,The lights are super wavy and don’t straighten out. And I suggest ordering a size up. I ordered my usual size and the arms and stomach aare pretty tight and the head is super big.
2.0,It is super cute and fits well although the strip of rhinestones fell out the indention they’re in within 3 days of wearing it
2.0,"I think this could be a good product, but it has a little way to go on improving durability. I ordered two sets of these, one for each wheel. The first front wheel set stopped working and they sent me a new one (but that one seems to have never been delivered, which is a courier/Amazon issue). But right after they sent the replacement, the back wheel set stopped working too. Both were only a month or two old. From those two data points, these don't seem like they will last."
2.0,I love the design and my son is obsessed with it but... it runs super small and quite possibly shrunk in dryer. He wasn’t able to wear for very long unfortunately.
2.0,"Poor quality,  lens was not in tact."
2.0,Gives you uniboob and is ugly
2.0,"It was cute, material was very soft but the neckline was ripped.  Returned.  5’3” and with flats the length just skimmed the floor but did not drag."
2.0,"So I made this purchase about two to three months ago. The purse did not last as long as I hoped for. It's a beautiful color and style but the material is awful. The strap on the back side where the zipper pocket is located, broke. Not just one, but both sides stitching came out and broke on me in public, truly embarrassing. I've tried minding it but no such luck. I've bought cheaper purses than this and they've at least last me longer than a year. So I was very disappointed. I guess I'll just have to be better with reading the product reviews."
2.0,"Seemed nice enough, but the description says it fits wrists starting at 5.5”. My wrist is 5.5” and it doesn’t remotely fit. Had to return."
2.0,Thin material but it is cheap so that is okay. But the decal pealed after first wash and dry. Better go with something else.
2.0,Beautiful dress but poorly made.  Bow came off immediately.  And the neckline folded over so you could see the lining.  Also arrived very wrinkled so I had to pay to have it pressed and mended.
2.0,atter 6 months its falling apart along the seams<br /><br />you get what you pay for
2.0,"I really liked the look of this piece, but it would not stay in one orientation. It would rotate on me and stick my ear or get stuck in my hair. I had to return this. It might have been better if the bar was not in the middle so it would stop rotating as much."
2.0,"Like the design and fabric. Althoug, the color description says burgundy, the item received was bright red."
2.0,"First, sizing chart was incorrect resulting in me reaching out and requesting a different size. Then when the subsequent size arrived it was still too small. I returned it for full refund."
2.0,"The sapphire arrived on time.  But the stone is so dark, even holding it up to a bright light, one can see no blue - so it looks like a black stone.  I haven't looked at it with a hand lens yet to determine whether the problem is truly just darkness or opacity.  I guess I don't care, unless I send it back - and my wife was a good sport about it.  Even though she loves sapphires, she said this black stone is presentable, too.<br /><br />So I guess the bottom line is that it's not really very practical to buy colored gemstones online without first seeing them."
2.0,"I am now wondering if Bianchi has changed their belts.  I believed I ordered the correct size but when it arrived, this buckle did not fit my belt.  The beckle is shaped slightly different than my old buckle (purchased in 2014).  I understand this could have been my error but my recommendation is be sure this is the correct buckle you want before ordering."
2.0,Very poor quality. Glasses are uneven and give me headache than helping
2.0,it looks nice in pic when got it didnt look like same.
2.0,"Its cheaply made and looks tacky in person. This necklace just has too much going on, it may just be me but its just not the same as in the picture."
2.0,"Shirt fit to size, pants were huge and unwearable"
2.0,"Updated with photos<br /><br />I love the look & fit. It takes the Luxe from looking like just a fitness tracker to a piece of jewelry. The main problem I have is how hard it is to take off & put on my wrist. The catch is very hard to work, if you don’t get it perfectly into the little grove it won’t click shut. Even having nails it hard to undo the catch as well (but it shouldn’t just come undone either - so that is both good & bad.)<br /><br />I purchased this April 26th & it is now June 21st - so less than 2 months. The edges where the band attaches to the unit have gotten all scratched up. I work on a computer all day long, so there really isn't anything for it to get scratched by.  I guess I'm going to have to see what else is out there.<br /><br />Now August 16, so about 2 more months in - I have had this band for less than 4 months & it looks like crap! The leather is worn and nearly all of the metal plating near the tracker itself is gone. I tried to remove one more link so the tracker wouldn't feel so loose, but then it is too tight. Because of the quality my rating has gone from 4 stars when I first got it, to 3 stars after less than 2 months down to 2 stars now. The only good thing I have to say is that it doesn't fall off - the clasp itself works very well, but I am going to have to replace my band."
2.0,Logo is much smaller than displayed on the picture. Logo is practically the size and with of my pinky finger..In the picture the Logo goes all the way down to the fold of the cap. What i received there's actually a two finger gap. Not happy guess I get what I paid for. Never again
2.0,"The wristlit broke the week I got it. Then, the zipper broke and it can only take so much. The seem broke, the change holder has a hole in the bottom. It was cute but cheaply made for sure."
2.0,I am short n fat usually Old Navy I can wear 2xl but not even a 3xl here!
2.0,The material was real very flimsy.
2.0,I asked for a 10 1/2 and they gave me a 9 1/2  They also looked cheaply made
2.0,Gloves are not good quality! My granddaughter put them on and created a hole instantly! The hat is good!
2.0,The latch on the necklace broke the first time my son wore this. He put it on and several hours later took it off for be the latch completely broke.
2.0,The size runs very small.
2.0,"Poor quality, very thin, not supportive"
2.0,Ugh this sucks I ordered these as a gift for someone and they don't fit... then she didn't return them so she gave them back. So I still have them in the box.
2.0,"Rough lace and a seam up the front. They are now my, &#34;only if I haven't done laundry undies&#34;"
2.0,"The front leopard  print section is very wide.  When I removed it from the plastic bags which it came in, the belt had a very strong smell.  I had to have it hang outside the closet, for approximately 10 days in order to be able to use it."
2.0,I found that it didn't grip the leather strap well so it becomes detached. Plus the release is awkward and difficult to use.
2.0,"Ive bought 2 of these within 3 weeks and both times the flag has fallen off. very pretty, just didnt last"
2.0,"Giving it two stars because the print is cute. The fit however is very disappointing, even though I sized up. This is not mean for curvier women whatsoever. It’s squished my boobs in and fits very strangely around the nether regions. It is lined and that doesn’t help whatsoever."
2.0,"Love the bag pattern, but this is the third Vera Bradley product I've ordered from Amazon and all of them had loose strings and seams falling apart. Not surprised, but disappointed."
2.0,This American Flag neck gaiter has orange stripes instead of red.
2.0,These socks pilled after the first use.  The socks seemed very nice at first ...and I would have given a better rating had these not pilled.
2.0,Chain broke after only. wearing it for a month.
2.0,"The material is rough and uncomfortable.  The fit is too tight around the shoulders, but maternity-like around the waist.  Not a flattering fit."
2.0,"First of all they arrived with a tiny whole already developing in the crotch and the fit is strange.  I ordered an x large and they still fit like a large or medium.  I can tell they're going to shrink up to next to nothing.  Oh well, they were inexpensive."
2.0,The front of this bottom was oddly cut. It was a lot of material in the front like a boy short and the back was nicely cut and cinched.
2.0,"I order 2 of the same dresses, same size in different colors. The blue one was a perfect fit, but the red one was a bit snug (fitted tighter)!"
2.0,"This is just a loop of knit fabric with cut, unfinished edges.<br />It’s too loose to stay on my seven year old’s head. He’s smallish, but definitely not toddler-sized, and he even has super thick hair!<br />The dinosaur pattern is adorable and gender-neutral.<br />My son loved it, but it’s ridiculously overpriced for what it is."
2.0,"A nice pair of shades, the screw for the nose rest fell out before I could open it, thankfully I had a second pair that I could replace the screw with. They stretch and scratch easily, I'd say best for a summer or a vacation as they don't last too long."
2.0,My son absolutely love this outfit. It’s not the best fabric and is pretty cheap and see through but is holding up pretty good in the wash.
2.0,Giotto? Joke. This is a Chinese product with Chinese lettering all over the packaging and the price tag in yuan. Giotto translates to &#34;Cituo&#34; which is boldly written on the shoe and makes it feel cheap. Will be returning.
2.0,Wrong color was sent and it sits very awkward on the ear
2.0,These gloves will rip out at the fingers for no reason.  Spend the extra and get a better-quality glove.
2.0,Not as sturdy as I thought they would be. Hoping to never have to use it though!
2.0,Yes but at the same time no. They have screw that keeps scratching my face
2.0,"Don't care for it, did not even wear it, it was just too much going on and didn't compliment my outfits.  Wouldn't recommend."
2.0,It said (when ordering) that the fit was 100%.  I wear Large....  it was WAY too small!!!  NOT COOL
2.0,Cheaper quality but it is what you pay for. Dress is a bit long if you are shorter.
2.0,"I have small hands and these gloves were too tight even for me.  Unfortunately they do not sell these in various sizes so unless you have tiny hands I don't recommend them.<br /><br />Regarding quality, not great but I wasn't expecting much.  I need several pairs and would have ordered them directly from Gloves-Online as they are much less expensive but ordered one pair from Amazon to try.  Guess I need to keep looking."
2.0,Fit was not as expected.  Much too small.  Gave them to a friend rather than send back.
2.0,it fits tight around the arms
2.0,Top Hard to put on and runs small
2.0,"For the most part he loved it. However,  he was cooking and a flame touched the tip of the robe and spread so quickly! Yes, the robe is ruined."
2.0,I really liked this until ... it wouldn't stay closed when I was carrying it and the zipper broke after one use. To bad this was just after the return window closed.
2.0,"The whole reason I bought this was for the fan function. I had something similar for a paintball mask that worked phenomenally, but this tiny fan doesn't seem to do ANYTHING to defog the mask it keep it from fogging up. :-("
2.0,"Sometimes vision is blurred when wearing these lenses, mostly when driving. My wife won't wear them. I wear them around and sometimes while driving. Metal frame can get HOT when left in a hot car. Otherwise the fit and finish and style are good, and lens specs are impressive, but I would not buy again. I also bought the DUCO glasses with the plastic frames and the lenses do not distort/blur like these do."
2.0,Wrong color sent. Received a dusty blue with tan flowers and not a vibrant navy with pink flowers. The fit was great and shipping was timely. Just too bad the dress wasn't as pictured.
2.0,Very disappointed that only one shoe charges.<br />One shoe lights up red when charging and the other one doesn’t.
2.0,"I bought these and immediately had to return them.  Having read the reviews, I bought them in a WHOLE SIZE LARGER than i usually wear.  As soon as I put them on, I could tell they were still WAY too narrow (and while my feet are wider than some, they aren't that wide).  There is a hard seam on the inside where the upper connects to the sole, and it ran the length of the shoe under my foot on both sides.  Totally uncomfortable -- would have caused blisters and worse.<br /><br />They felt well-made and I'm sure would be comfortable if you have narrow feet, but the sizing is so messed up and these are unwearable if your feet are even a little wide."
2.0,Stones were dull /cloudy not as picture shown<br />Disappointed.
2.0,It was way to big in the chest and arms. The neck hole was small and I even ripped it putting it on within a week of owing it. The hood seems too small as well.
2.0,"This product was not protective enough for my 90 yr old father while he ate.  He is 6'3"" and in Assisted Living."
2.0,It is very cute!! But for an XL it fits like a Medium. I am dissappointed that it didnt work for me. I will have to give to someone that can wear it.
2.0,The posts are very thick.  I had a really difficult time getting them in and then they were just very uncomfortable to wear.
2.0,"I was able to wear it twice.  It was so cheap, I'm glad i got to wear it at all. Got what i paid for-"
2.0,The chain broke very easily. Not happy with purchase
2.0,"They were cheap so I wasn’t expecting much from these. Several of them had the tiny screws fall out, thankfully I didn’t need all of them. Can’t fit a small child’s face. More for decoration. Will not purchase again."
2.0,Super cute skirt but unfortunately runs really small and  is made with a low quality fabric... after a few washes all the sowing started to rip.
2.0,The sleeves are a little too long. The zipper failed the second time wearing. Zipper would not zip up past chest. All in all a comfortable hoodie of not for the sleeves and horrible zipper. I would not recommend this hoodie to anyone solely based on the zipper alone.
2.0,"I wanted to like these, but nothing ever looks right through them. If I want the reading part I have to tilt my head way back and even then it's hard to make it work. Plain reading/computer glasses work much better for me."
2.0,"Much much smaller than appears, nice quality."
2.0,"I’m not a fan. I purchased from another seller previously and the quality was much better. I’m unsure if this is a defective batch, but there is so much white space between the sequins. I wouldn’t recommend unless you don’t care about the look."
2.0,"WOW. The pulseometer numbers are absoultely MICROSCOPIC. Not readable at all.  The concept of this style watch is great, but this watch face in general is very small and difficult to read overall.  Even if you have perfect vision, I believe this watch face is too small for using during clinicals or otherwise....as a healthcare professional who needs this type of time piece. The quality seems decent, and I liked the fact that the rubber housing comes off to wash...but those two aspects are useless if you cannot read the watch face!"
2.0,"Definitely ordered my size but they were way too big, sizing is not correct at all. Order at least 2-3sizes smaller than what u would normally wear!"
2.0,the thing in the middle was missing
2.0,"Was nice, broke after a week."
2.0,"After hearing a lot of good things about these leggings I wanted to give them a try.  But,  I found them to be pretty thin, so they went back."
2.0,"The rings are good, however the picture is not what I recieved. I though by the picture they would be threaded,  and the balls would screw on and off. Instead I received captive ball rings. I personally hate captive ball rings. They are a hassle to put in and take out.  And something about using pliers around my nipples makes me nervous.  They did however come really fast, ordered on a friday and got on monday."
2.0,"The hat came creased, the stars were peeling off. Asked for another replacement same thing..."
2.0,false advertisement
2.0,Actually cheaper looking than we thought. Sorry
2.0,it was super cute but broke the first day i got it. very disappointed.
2.0,"I just got this last week, I don't wear it to bed or have it in any water.  It's tarnishing and exposing what looks like cheap cooper under the silver color and turning my wrist green.  It's a beautiful band but it is NOT stainless steel as advertised."
2.0,"I have other colors of this dress (long sleeved) and I love them - great purchases.  But, this short sleeved version appears to be made out of different fabric which is not so great.  This dress is a bit clingy and just doesn’t fit the same way the long sleeved version does."
2.0,1. Runs 2 sizes smaller than your normal size. I ordered a L because I wanted it to be roomy and when I put it on it fits without any extra room.<br />2. Material is very cheap and very thin. I was looking for a thick sweatshirt that it appeared to be in the pictures.<br />3. I'll keep it anyway.
2.0,"Not a very good fit at all.  I would have to agree with some of the other reviews that mention no support in the waist area.  I could not even wear them to the gym.  The band at the waist do not offer any support at all.  They eventually start falling down and revealing the butt area.  They are very cute, so I was a little disappointed."
2.0,"Fit is fine but brim is flimsy, the shade from the brim likely won’t even cover the eyes."
2.0,homestly the dress feels nice- and maybe it just doesnt look great on me per say- But it doesnt look anything like the picture.
2.0,"The bracelet itself is absolutely adorable. However, I've noticed that the pendant itself came with some wear - small little scratches, and a larger sized dent on the front next to the symbol. Also, it did not come in a 'black velvet bag'. I didn't care about that so much, but why have it listed as such when it just comes in a typical mailer? It's cute, but this is what's to be expected at this price."
2.0,"I am an avid water sport type of guy, and spend as much time in the Sea, Lakes, or Pool as i can. Having Blue eyes though the sensitivity to the Sun is pretty high, so finding a pair of swim goggles that would allow me to enjoy my time in the water, and without lose Sunglasses every time i do. I have a 7 1/4 hat size, which is not a huge Melon at all, and I consider my nose to be neither French, Italian, Greek, or Broken....but just....ordinary. My eyes are where they are supposed to be, which makes these goggles all the more strange.<br /><br />After admiring the design, making a few adjustment to the strap, I donned them. Ok, the 1st thing i noticed was that the Nose bridge does not allow for 1. There is not a convexed mid section of note for  the nose to fit in. The 2nd part is that with the mask pretty tight, the side of the goggles is still not making contact with the outside side of my eyes creating a seal so water cannot get in my eyes.<br /><br />My only conclusion is that these googles were designed using someone who is flat nosed, and has been hit with a shovel repeatedly. So, if you have a flat face, no nose bridge, these are for you!!"
2.0,Does not fit as described. Way too small!!
2.0,"La suela es muy delgada y cualquier objeto filoso puede traspasarlo. Cuando caminas por lugares llenos de escombros puedes sentir cada piedra cuando pisas .  En pisos lisos pulidos no tiene buen agarre se delisan . No son impermeables .. y la forma de la suela hace que cuando caminas en barro recoja mucho barro quiero decir que el barro se queda pegado en la suela ,  las cosas buenas que tiene es que es liviano el zapato y económico , la medida ancha es amplia no sientes el metal de la punta"
2.0,"Ordered this dress for my baby shower, i read lot of good reviews about this dress before ordering. Unfortunately the dress is too tight on the top part, also i didn't like the material, not impressive enough to wear for parties or photoshoot.  I am 28 weeks pregnant, i wear size L for all my maternity dresses and ordered same for this one, however the top part and sleeves were too tight. maybe it will fit for people with smaller sizes, definitely not for me !!  Returned it."
2.0,it shrank and did not fit well after first washing;  cheap  material.
2.0,"It was GREAT in the beginning. But very quickly, within a week or two, the shock function was not working as well as it was initially. Now, four months in (after me trying and trying to figure out little fixes and hacks for it) it's not working at all. I've seen enough other reviews to know this is a common problem. Why make a product of such bad quality? To cheat people out of their money? I haven't been rough with this at all and to that end, I only wear it at night when I sleep. And I heard these issues continue in the 3rd version as well.<br /><br />Why haven't the issues been fixed, is my question?<br /><br />Honestly this was a great idea and I wanted so badly for it to work. But I'm disgusted and disappointed. The reason I didn't try to get a replacement was because this was a Christmas present from my feeble old grandmother and I didn't want to bother her with something like this, she'd take it personally and feel bad about it. So. I guess all I can do is be angry and warn others away from the product."
2.0,Love the idea but they were to fat for my holes.
2.0,Size descriptions aren’t  accurate I ordered a size that was larger then my actual size and it is still too small
2.0,The material is weird and fees cheap. Definitely cant wear this dress to go out in but can use to sleep in or a bthig suit coverup.
2.0,Not as described.  Very cheaply made. And way too small. Made more for a child than an adult.
2.0,"A nice, big variety to choose from. Nice quality metal and worksmanship. I'm only giving 2 stars because the gauge sizing is off. I ordered the 20 guage & when I got them, they were more like a 16 guage that definitely wont fit my piercings. I dont know if it's a mistake on the description."
2.0,"If you just need something that zips closed & separates things on a fundamental level, then these will work fine. However, every picture for this items gives the impression that there is at least some kind of boxy structure to these bags (making them easier to stack, etc.).<br /><br />There is zero structure to these bags. None whatsoever. Unless you pack them 100% full & pack things in a boxy type format,that is literally the only way to remotely come close to what the pictures show. If it's not crammed full of stuff, it's a whole mess.<br /><br />The only good thing is the clear toiletry bag, as it is a good quality. But i will never have any reason to use the rest of these bags, they're completely useless for travel organization."
2.0,I specifically bought these to be able to change lenses for night bike riding in wind.<br />The dark lens is fixed in frame and I can not be interchanged with other light colored lens.
2.0,These are more like a leggings with a zipper in the back.
2.0,"The shorts I received were not the same style as the shorts in the photograph, they did not have the V in the back of the waist band. The  shorts I got fit smaller that the photographed style, and were light grey. Returned them."
2.0,"These boots were actually shockingly comfortable, but they just look so cheap. With boots, like with many things, you really get what you pay for, and these definitely look like inexpensive boots."
2.0,"They fit fine and we’re very soft/comfortable...but they are completely see-through! Very thin material. Disappointing since I loved the pocket feature and the way the leggings felt while on, but definitely not functional for gym or going out of the house."
2.0,I wasn't real happy with the shirt quality. Wrinkles easily. Would have liked it if it were 50 cotton 50 polyester instead of 100 percent cotton. My mistake should have checked before I ordered. The design was not centered real well either. The price was too much for the quality.
2.0,"Looks better on picture, missed that it had no buttons or belts  to close it. Ok quality"
2.0,this jacket is thin. and the wrong color pink and it does not look like this in person..... I got hot pink instead of mauve pink.....
2.0,Jacket design and color  does not look the same in person as in pic
2.0,"They are beautiful, and looked great on my daughter. Fast shipping and well packaged,  however one broke and fell off her ear... now I'm stuck with just earring as she lost the other."
2.0,one watch not work
2.0,Item is thinner than expected
2.0,The top of the shoe was dented and it was unwearable.
2.0,it was made cheep. the pics it looked like better quality
2.0,"Very cute, good price, and I'm certain the 2X is sized correctly...for residents of Munchkinland. Really, really tight fit on both the top and bottom...more how I'd think an XL would fit me. And honestly, the 3x probably wouldn't have been the comfy fit I want in PJs either... The fabric was a light knit, which is what I wanted, but in addition to being at least 2 sizes too small, the fabric had almost no give to it either, so that made it worse. I normally can do either 2 or 3X, with 3X being sometimes too loose, so this was a shocker and a disappointment."
2.0,It was too small and the adhesive didn't stick.  It was a waste of my money.
2.0,"I'm typically an XL and I like my clothes to fit pretty loose. I'm 5'5 and about a 40 D. The shirt fit me way too big, also I ordered yellow. The picture shows a more dandelion yellow and I got a light green color."
2.0,"Altho these pants are comfortable and yes I bought the right size, they keep rolling down at the top."
2.0,The shirt fit as expected and is a nice style but the material is too thin. Looks cheaply made. I Would not recommend.
2.0,Well this is not a nice quality beanie.<br />Cheap looking and its not adult male<br />Size at all.  Not unless his head shrinks and he shaves his head.
2.0,"it is a lovely dress but it happens to show your butt! The cutouts are very revealing for my taste, and I am 5 '4. Returned it"
2.0,Came in two different sizes Large and Medium for the waist. I believe I ordered XL
2.0,"Very large size, I was looking for something more dainty"
2.0,"When I first saw them and put them on I was pleased, but the first time that I wore them for an entire day, I spent the day constantly pulling them back up. Disappointed in that. A good boot sock should not pull down into the boot."
2.0,Nice bracelet but size is for a man. This will fit very few women. It was returned
2.0,Awesome shirt! Small is X-LARGE! Don’t buy it - the message is wonderful but you’ll never wear it
2.0,"The bodice was tight, but the flowing skirt part was very loose and fluffy."
2.0,Says adjustable—but can’t hardly move it afraid to break it—runs small!!
2.0,Chain was broken. Good price for how many items you get but the pictures do not depict the items very well. Bought for an 80s themed party and ended up only using the blow up boom box and microphones.
2.0,It is the wrong size it is not a 2x
2.0,A bit strange of a fit
2.0,"Disappointed. These are very pretty and I was excited to use them. Unfortunately, they don’t stay on my t shirts. I tried several shorts / different materials hoping they would stay put on something. But, they kept sliding down and falling off. Lost 1 the first day I used them."
2.0,"Very thin , its like a cut off shirt sleeve,  so they should've been like a dollar not 10..but whatever..someone has to make a million off of a fake virus somewhere."
2.0,"Product is made well material good quality but sizing is on the small size if u r in between sizes, go to the larger size"
2.0,"[[VIDEOID:ea119553340d5c6ab5ecd05a47e636cf]] These broke the first night I wore them as I was taking one off. The material is a hard sponge on the flowers. The bull heads are a suede like fabric that doesn't stay flat.<br />When I ordered a replacement, THAT one arrived broken. I kept the good earrings from each set but I don’t think it will last long. They are not clay. Play dough, maybe. Disappointing, but 1 star for a cute design-<br /><br />It’s now 11/8 and one earring is miss a petal. Such a pretty earrin but breaks too easily or comes misaligned, so parts rub and break. Too bad, I enjoyed them but never had earring break that fast at a dollar store."
2.0,Product is one size but it is pretty big. Also had a terrible plastic smell when i took it out of the bag. Picture makes it look soft than it is. Unfortunately returning item.
2.0,"They are stylish,but distort your vision."
2.0,Very nice shoes but only one shoe lights up. And the charms are very hard to get on. My granddaughter loves them though just wish both shoes lite up when she walk. UPDATE: just got the second pair and so far they are both working we will see what happens once she wears them.
2.0,I can't walk in this dress. It looks cute on but I keep needing to pick up the bottom to walk properly otherwise I need to make teeny tiny steps. This is a huge inconvenience. Also it had what I thought was a stain in the front but later turned out to be a little white string that I cannot remove.
2.0,Way too dark to use as needed
2.0,I like the feel and comfort of these face mask but the reason for my rating were they I have to do a extra tie to the ear the loops are too large they should have the adjustable ear loops
2.0,"Not very comfortable socks,  Must be for 4-5 size instead of 7-10."
2.0,"Unfortunately, I have to return them.  I ordered the 32 waist x 30 inseam, which is my exact size.  However, while the waist fit, the length was easily 6 inches too long.  And the crotch was way too low.  I also didnt like the &#34;elastic&#34; cuff at the bottom of the leg.  I didnt realize this when I purchased them.<br />On the positive side, they did seem well made, and I liked the free socks."
2.0,"Quality seems good, but these run very small.  The 2XL fits like a large."
2.0,"Snug fit yet flexible. Material used not restrictive at all. Having only the three fingers open makes working in gloves a breeze. You’ve heard, ‘ Fit’s like a glove.’ These are those.<br />UDATE:  It’s not what I hoped. I stated earlier,‘not restricting. Well, that’s because material was coming apart. They have been worn maybe 30min. I highly recommend to keep looking."
2.0,"The leather strap looks great with my diver watch! Unfortunately, after 2 months of moderate wear, the strap started to split."
2.0,They are flimsy and do not secure glasses to your head. The arms of the glasses kept falling out of the plastic loops
2.0,"Very light, plastic feel to it. Its ok for what  paid for it but Im really glad I didnt spend anymore. It does look nice from a distance though"
2.0,Of course I know you usually get what you pay for. This ring was very cheap looking and was too loose on my finger. I returned it.
2.0,"The arm holes are cut so low, it's difficult to find anything to wear under it"
2.0,"Meh. The polyester is pretty rough, and it's not breathable at all. The elastic waist band is uncomfortable and scratchy."
2.0,"this is really small. definitely a baby or toddler size, not kids. total waste of my money"
2.0,"I had no issue with the delivery, but I would have much rather received the items as pictured (with the bag storage built in to the bag itself) instead of what I actually got. I received completely separate storage pouches for my bags that are attached to the bag with one flimsy stitch (some aren’t even sewn together and are two totally separate pieces).<br /><br />For now they’re cute and functional, but I’m already chasing the separated storage pouches at the checkout lane to make sure they come home with me.<br /><br />It’s also worth noting that the picture shows a bunch of grapes, a strawberry, a carrot, a kiwi, and a pineapple bag that supposedly have graphics printed on the bag. I received plain bags in the shape of a carrot, a kiwi, an orange, a red chili pepper, and a very confused looking banana."
2.0,Tight very uncomfortable
2.0,Although i still like what i received it was not as it was shown. i ordered the dark gray and they sent me the light gray which is all fleece.
2.0,received the bracelet while I was trying it on the chain broke.  I would have preferred an 8&#34; - I sent the bracelet back for a refund.<br /><br />Linda
2.0,"Sleeves short, good if you have mussels, I dont"
2.0,"Bought this for my daughter who needed a jacket when traveling. It tore the first time she wore it. Granted, the winds and rain were apocalyptic that day, and an inexpensive jacket wasn't likely to last. Hoped it would last longer than that!"
2.0,looks is great but neck and shoulder cut are too small.
2.0,Very very cheap watch. I didn't expect much for the price but this is just terrible.
2.0,The pendant is cute. Only buy it for the pendant.The chain is ugly/low quality. But the cat is very cute.
2.0,Tag says _Dry Clean Only&#34;! Really? Must have missed that in the description.
2.0,Not compatible did not fit watch
2.0,"The comments recommended to size up so as a 34i + 8/10, I got the XL. I'm pretty sure I could fit another full grown human in there with me. Will be returning and trying the medium."
2.0,"Wear XL bought 2xl snug,bought other companies,no problem"
2.0,Its for no one that has any kind of stomach or trunk.  I bought a 3X and it was more like an XL.
2.0,"I returned this top. The fabric is thin and clingy, not what I expected."
2.0,Terrible just terrible will not purchase ever again
2.0,"I'm sorry, this is a really beautiful pendant, but too small!.It's imposible to use this pendant with  another chain, if you want to change the original one"
2.0,"Was OK, but don't like the way it looks on me."
2.0,"I'm not happy with this dress. Not only is it to big, but it's too thin, and not at flattering or what I was expecting."
2.0,These should be called &#34;back to the 60's shorts&#34;.  I guess I can wear them as underwear.  oh well......live and learn.
2.0,"Not at all a nice belt. Not a nice finish and does not hold up too well either, but I guess you get what you pay for."
2.0,Returned. Not what I expected.<br />Terrible ban
2.0,"I haven't had this for too long and the outside ""fake leather"" is flaking off looking undesirable. It is vegan though and proud of it but I recommend a nylon belt over this. Second one in 3 years. Sad, but vegan!"
2.0,"Shorts are weird. Dress is super thin. Wasn’t what I expected, will be returning."
2.0,Wrong size was received.  I ordered a Large and I received a Small.  Other than that it was a nice leotard.  Gave it to a friend.
2.0,Feels like wearing it backward. Ridea high and snug around the neck.<br />A label is in the proper place.<br />I'm a bit barrel-chested thanks to Joe Weider supplements from the 90s. ;)
2.0,"It's too big for my daughter's face, she's 4 and has very small face and it's not fitted properly"
2.0,"Not a fan. Smaller than I expected. Looks cheaply made. Wouldn’t recommend for an adult because it’s small, and wouldn’t recommend for a kid because it tore easily. Definitely only got one wear out of it before I threw it away."
2.0,The dress looked dumpy and the hem was uneven
2.0,Very cute dress but runs super small. I returned and never re ordered
2.0,only problem one of the earrings were broke
2.0,Hem was uneven
2.0,"Cute top but the fabric stains way too easily. Any little bit of lotion, deodorant etc. leaves a greasy looking spot."
2.0,Not impressed the gown was so large it looked awful
2.0,"Item is not true to size.  I wear Large or XL, and I ordered XL just to be safe, but it can't be larger than a small or medium in size.  Sweater doesn't wrap around to the front at all."
2.0,It's hard to tell from a picture exactly what a purchase will be like. It's very poor quality. The scarf is just a piece of cloth that's not even stitched - just torn edges; the badge is cheap plastic - something you could get at the Dollar Store; and the mask is a thin piece of some type of cloth. I paid $20 for all three items - the price is really shocking when you see the quality and how little you get. All my purchases from Amazon have been great except this one.
2.0,"Too big for my face. Ok style. Ok plastic/metal used for the price. But constantly fell off. They adjusted larger, but not smaller. don't reccoment with those of you with average to small facial features/head size."
2.0,"The bottoms are too full. Does not fit my body type. I'm 5'4 117 and bought the small, but the elastic is not properly placed and the skirt is way too full."
2.0,Pretty sure I ordered a small but received a medium and it was huge. Returning and reordering for a small; the fabric is silky and soft. Cut of the dress looks slightly different but may be because of the size discrepancy. Will update review upon receipt of correct size.<br /><br />5'4 134lbs 34A for size reference
2.0,I ordered a size larger to make sure and still way to tight. Must be Asian feet.
2.0,"These boots do not have a zipper to make it easy for someone to put on.  You have to struggle to get these on and forget tucking the jeans into the boot, it's impossible."
2.0,These are pretty good for the price but they definitely aren't memory foam
2.0,Loved the style. The clasp slides & doesn’t stay at all. I got it to my wrist look down & it’s loosened up. Almost lost it a few times. Can’t wear it. Dissatisfied & disappointing...
2.0,Size too small for my teen daughter who usually fits M/L. Missed the return period. Otherwise very cute.
2.0,"This is a revised review. Originally I loved them because they look great. However, I wore them for not even two weeks and they already have a giant scratch across the lens. The lenses are cheap!! Not worth the money!"
2.0,I’ve bought two of these and the first one kept snagging things and the second broke after a month.
2.0,Way too thin and see thru I had to send back
2.0,"Material sad you’d but way to skinny, I have a skinny daughter (2) and she barely fit them."
2.0,"After about 3 months of use, the band is all scratched up.<br />Apart from the scratches, the magnets are strong and the band is not too bad."
2.0,its ok<br />the eye evil is very small<br />no one can really see the eye
2.0,"I was hoping it would help wake the impossible one to wake up, but it did not work at all.  Huge waste of money.  I can’t even return.  By the time you decide if it works or not, the return window is closed."
2.0,These are so cheaply made. You could probably get the same quality at the dollar store!  One of the ear was loose at the bottom corner and bends forward slightly.
2.0,"To say this was too small would be a joke.<br />I ordered an XXL because I knew the Asian sizing runs small, but I have successfully been ordering Asian sizing for the past two years.<br />The XXL just barely--and I mean BARELY fit my size 4 very thin Adult American niece.<br /><br />I'm generously giving 2 stars because the dress is beautiful, but seriously XXL=Adult Size 4"
2.0,"These are very uncomfortable shoes.  My feet are men's size 14.  I have neuropathy as well as high arches.  With the inserts in them, the shoe is way too small.  The Ortho inserts are uncomfortable and hard.  Without the inserts in the shoe, they lack arch support and cushion.  I do not care for them but will make them work for my purposes.  I did not try to return them."
2.0,Fits like a tent. I bought a small and it is huge and baggy with no shape. The color is nice. But there is a weird seam near the knot.
2.0,Zip back top thought it was longer over hips
2.0,"Belt buckle extremely difficult to open and close. I have two other buckle belts, but without the problem"
2.0,"The design and print is cute, but the quality of THIS shirt is poor.  People thought I literally cut it myself from a normal shirt. Definitely not the look I was going for.  My friend got the off the shoulder style and it was a way better quality shirt.<br /><br />I wrote the company to give them feedback on the cut off this shirt and they did not respond."
2.0,It is not true to size.  I would suggest ordering 2 sizes larger.
2.0,They were a strange fit
2.0,They’re cute so I’m gonna give 2 stars. I only got a black spike one which is currently in my nose but I got no silver or the black ball one. The black spike is poor metal or something and is hard to even go through my septum hole. Total waste of money and didn’t even get all my jewelry.
2.0,The product was not TTS. The zipper was also broken when I received this in the mail.
2.0,you will just drag it behind you all night/day long
2.0,"This dress is made with a plastic-y fabric, think waterproof tablecloth. Not impressed for the price"
2.0,Bought this for my daughter for Christmas. She loved it however after only a week the stitching for the legs and the bottom came apart for no reason. Other than the stitching it was super cute and she still loves it.
2.0,Size too big : not happy with material
2.0,"I like this vest for size and pockets.  However it took a very long time to ship, was so wrinkled I had to iron it heavily just to attempt to find some shape.  In addition one of the pockets was torn on the inside so I had to sew it up. If this item arrived intact I would have given it a higher score because it's nice once I fixed it."
2.0,"why does this hat have ""est 1987"" on it?  THE USAF WAS ESTABLISHED IN 1947.<br />No USAF vet will wear this, I know I am a retired USAF MSgt!!!!!"
2.0,"Cut very short otherwise would have been nice but I can’t wear it it’s not no comfortable it’s almost like a crop top, not a long fit like shown"
2.0,"Disappointed In The Sizing,The Largest Size 2Xl ,  Runs Small , Pasted Along To My Young Nephew - Very Small Pockets  Attached , Really Not Necessary - Construction & Material Is Decent & Light Weight"
2.0,It fits weird and it's really thin so don't plan on wearing in the cold without undershirt
2.0,Size runs very small. Looks nice but the material is poor quality
2.0,I thought this watch would come as is as I ordered it's a beautiful watch. But I'm not satisfied because it is too big to even work with with no paperwork instructions warranty nothing I'm sorry I'm sending it back sincerely the purchaser RP.
2.0,The shirt had some kind of stain on the front of it.  Because my husband needed the shirt that week we didn't return it.  I tried washing but the stain stayed.  It looked almost like a couple of bleach drops.
2.0,There is nothing wrong with the earring itself.  I just ordered them too small and they are hard for me to get on.  Ordered a larger size to replace them.
2.0,"They look okay but the waist was way too small. I have similar pants from other brands which are all labelled the same size as these and they all fit fine, these pants were 1-2 inches smaller in the waist. I could barely button them when I sucked it in and stretched them as far as they would go. I'm returning them and I ordered some Tru-Spec 24-7's."
2.0,"The craftsmanship of this product is not in line with the price. The fabric is of decent quality, that is about all this sweatshirt has going for it.  These photos were taken straight out of the package. It has since been washed and has frayed even more.  I would not recommend spending the money. Walmart has sweatshirts that are a better value."
2.0,"It fits fine and is comfortable if you walk around with no shoes on. But as soon as shoes go on, the socks fly off your hills. I wish the maker thought to put grippers on the hills of the sock to make them stay put."
2.0,"I purchased a 3x (expecting it to be small) and it was still very small. The design and color were great but I wound up giving it to my petite teenage daughter, who wears a size small/medium."
2.0,Slippers fell apart within a short period of time. Had to purchase another pair elsewhere.
2.0,It's not as pretty and the top was to small
2.0,he loves it!! BUT!!  the tail DOESN'T STAY ON !!! HAD TO MAKESHIFT A way to keep the tail attached... YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED FOLKS!
2.0,Too big and clingy material.
2.0,The material and fit is not what it shows in the picture. The material is a cheap polyester. I wanted to add a belt to make it look better but the fit wasn't good either. I returned it.
2.0,lasted about two weeks - get what you pay for
2.0,"The color I received was nowhere close to the color I ordered.  The picture showed it to be a deep, bright pick. The actual item was light neon pink. Great sweatshirt,  just not at all the color I wanted"
2.0,Bigger and bulkier than expected therefore was not able to use for girls night out
2.0,I really liked the color and of course the concept. I saw a couple of previous reviews that mentioned the short torso area. It’s true. I knew after trying it on I didn’t have time to return before my trip. I took some of those old bra reinforced clips that turn it into a racer back and it worked for the time. Not very appealing for a busty woman. Threw it away when I returned.
2.0,The shirt quality itself is good but the pattern looks like it was printed off a low quality computer...?
2.0,kids hat...I was going for adult
2.0,Scratchy wool.  Merino is supposed to be the softest wool.  This is surely not Merino.  Largest size way too small and tight.  Should've returned it.
2.0,Somewhat less quality than I was expecting.
2.0,everytime you move your head- the earrings shift- the chain that the plate and tassel is on is not secure- it is all loose- and they flip over and tip- not worth the money if I now need to get my glue gun out to make them wearable!
2.0,"The material is soft and nice enough, however they run super duper small. Perhaps it is just the color that I got - which was the cream color. But I am telling you it was either sized incorrectly or you have to order up at least two sizes."
2.0,"I bought this for my daughter for Christmas. She loved it and immediately started wearing it. Unfortunately, the tip broke off the very 1st day. She still wears it but the white tip is missing. So far, no other issues."
2.0,Pump sprayer dispenses product poorly and is difficult to operate when trying to spray instep of a boot.
2.0,I got an XL and it was way too big. Looked like a big tent on me and just wasn’t flattering. I wear a 10-12 usually and have 34DDD size bust.
2.0,Hard to use as it is way too big and looks silly.
2.0,The socks are not as soft as I was hoping for and seem a little constricting. I ordered for my mom who needs soft socks to cover her fragile skin. I would return them if I could.
2.0,"Bought a 18 month size for my 15 month old. The hoodie fits a little snug, even though he's chunky. Didn't expect it to be so tight around the shoulders. Super cute outfit. But the deer are already starting to peel off the pants after ONE wash. Definitely disappointed."
2.0,"TOO SMALL, Too SHORT"
2.0,Unicorn does not stay on the ring  I had to reglue a bunch of them with hot glue
2.0,Hat was way to large - returned for refund
2.0,"From my perspective, the color of the bowtie is not as light as advertised. I rated this product two stars because it simply did not fit my needs."
2.0,Nearly impossible to screw in and uncomfortable when you do - if you’re using for your tragus. Ok for lobes!
2.0,Wanted to love these... but they lay weird in when in your ears!
2.0,I sized up twice and still won’t even almost zip
2.0,Band looks good but it won't stay on my Samsung gear s2. It keeps popping off any advice? I really want to use it love how it looks.
2.0,"This watch looked great, but the strap started tearing after 3 days of light use. Had to duct tape it together since I was on a trip. I don't know how long it will last but if the strap is this poorly made, I highly doubt the rest will last much longer. I will be contacting the seller for a refund."
2.0,"I'm usually a L on tops, but like my cardigans and hoodies a size up for a looser fit. Bought the XL (biggest size available) and it is tight on the arms and armpit, and doesn't even close to zip up. I'm approx. 165 lbs. and a 38B, size chart says an XL goes up to bust 42&#34;. It is way off! In addition, the stripes are closer to a very dark blue (almost black), not as pictured. Still a cute hoodie cardigan, but had to return."
2.0,"Too wide for what I need them for, I should have paid more attention to their measurements, my fault other than that very well made."
2.0,fair....novelty.. nothing more
2.0,"When the item arrived it was short and thin and reminded me of a dollar store scarf. The print is bright and colorful, but the stole it's self is cheaply made.  I was super disappointed and have nothing. I live out of the country and most of my orders take 2 weeks to get here, so I don't have enough time to time to safely order another one before graduation."
2.0,You get what you pay for. Cheap and color fades.
2.0,"Although I am petitie, the fit was a little snug for my size.  I think a large size would have fit nicer.  I also think the shorts could be a little longer so that jacket complements the look rather than covers the shorts."
2.0,Worst for ever.  Way too small.
2.0,Too tight and not a good fit
2.0,"Got this for my wife, she loved it.  On the second day it was missing from her wrist.  We found it with a link broken.  Had it fixed then a week later it was missing again, still have not found it."
2.0,"Even if you are thin, this suit will do nothing for you.  There is simply too much fabric that puffs out.  I can only imagine what it would do in the water."
2.0,Another one too late to return. I don't like the rufflely skirt and the embroidery looks very weird on me  anyway.
2.0,3/8 ripped within 3 months. 😢 Not long lasting quality. Wouldn’t buy again
2.0,"I returned this necklace. It was way too big.<br />Arrived packaged nicely, but it is an inch or two too long."
2.0,was too large and see thru.
2.0,Tore very easily. Cheaply made.
2.0,The color is a little bit dark. Not very happy with the yellow on the umbrella.
2.0,The slit came up way too high for it to be attractive.
2.0,For very small kids
2.0,Way too big for a 3 year old
2.0,"The outfit looks like picture , but it’s not flattering , I’m a slim body type with a butt , I ordered a large , it was to big ... the upper sleeve area is way to puffed out for my liking and the bottom of jumpsuit around the ankles is loose.."
2.0,The masks were hand washed when received in the mail and hung to dry. The material was wrinkled and it felt like they shrunk even though washed in warm water. They might be suitable for a child now as they are not fully covering like they should. The instructions state not to iron so that's out.  Not a good value for the price.
2.0,"I should have read the description more carefully. These are super large, and I will never wear them."
2.0,"Top straps Button broke within 6 hrs , and the fray on the bottom was way over ripped by manufacturers"
2.0,Product runs small but is a great design/print for the person who loves america
2.0,Liked these at first but the tent on the glasses and frames started to flake off
2.0,The sole of the show is completely bunched up and will not lay flat...
2.0,"The necklace is beautiful and of a nice weight.  I've only worn it twice so I can't tell yet if it'll tarnish quickly.  The earrings, however, were a disaster.  First, one of them was defective (about 1/3 of the coin was missing, as if it had not cast correctly).  I wore them just the same and tried to cover the wonky one with my hair.  But then, at the end of the night, I discovered that both coins had broken off from their attachment point.  Only the hooks remained in my ears.  It wasn't like I subjected them to frenzy dancing or vigorous walking for blocks...I merely took a stroll through an art gallery, so more sedated I couldn't have been.  I will likely remove 2 coins from the necklace and make my own earrings, but one shouldn't need to do that after a single wear, no matter the price one paid.  I do not recommend this set."
2.0,I read a lot of good reviews on these leggings and so was hoping for the best but these unfortunately didn’t work out for me. They ran way too large and so they are going back. The quality looks great but the fit just wasn’t right. I’ll have to stick to my lulu’s.
2.0,The gloves are not a heavy  as I thought & when I received them there were 2 holes in them.
2.0,The clips dont stay on your wrist they keep falling almost lost my watch a couple of times.
2.0,"I am torn on what stars to give this bathing suit. I haven't gone swimming in it yet so I can't say anything on how it holds up swimming, but it seems like it would be fine. I absolutely LOVE the style and the fit is great. I have a really hard time finding swim suits because I have added weight as of recently that I am very uncomfortable with, this swim suit is perfect though. The down side is, it came with a bunch of ruined stitching in several areas, I am unsure if it will end up coming completely unraveled after swimming or not, and I am not good a sewing. We shall see."
2.0,Described and pictured as off white but is actually a medium to light tan.  Description indicated that it was a slim fit but was actually a regular fit and when tried on it was way too large in all areas.
2.0,"Great looking watch however after paying to have the band adjusted, I tried, impossible, it's either too small or too big. Also the pins were rusted when the jeweler removed them. So it's just there to look at."
2.0,Not really compression. Fits the body nice but is super thin
2.0,"So iam being very nice giving this blouse a 2 star, if your looking for a flowy shirt where the strings on the shoulder hang down gracefully this isn't the shirt for you, which is what happen to me. First off i liked the flowy look of the shirt on the picture and yellow is my color, after seeing it in person i was dissapointed , its not flowy AND I HAD ORDERED 2 SIZES UP. and the strings are smaller than the photo so if you have broad shoulders it wont look right. also this shirt has an awkward tight thing in the bottom of the shirt which hangs onto your hips."
2.0,Rusted after a week of wearing but pretty.
2.0,The xlarge was bigger than expected!  This was considered a 14-16 size and it fit an adult.
2.0,"The packaging is pretty--a drawstring pink cloth bag with a white box inside. The delicate moon seemed like a good idea, but it just didn't work for me. I had trouble figuring out the double layers and difficulty using the clasp to put it on. The extender is a good idea, but didn't really help.  It was much shorter than I expected--the chain with the moon began above my collar bone. I had so much trouble taking it off that I finally just pulled on it and, of course, the delicate chain broke.  Others seem to have better luck, but this just didn't work for me."
2.0,Seam near the butt ripped before I even had a chance to wear it. I dont even have a butt so its not like it was because of that! Loved it otherwise
2.0,I ordered gray and it is definitely not as dark as the picture it is very very light. The seams are not professional looking at all and although it looks okay if I wouldn't purchase it again for the price.
2.0,"It's cute, but the biggest size they sell fits like medium."
2.0,The bag was too small to hold even one pair of boots.
2.0,Returned. I'm 34c. These were slightly larger and are not my opinion of what high impact should be.
2.0,Nice color and does the job but cheap material
2.0,The Matireal isn’t very giving  It looks exactly how they picture it  I just don’t like the cut.
2.0,"Nice heavy watch, keeps great time.<br />Watch crown cap came off when I unscrewed it though, I was able to fix it."
2.0,"Cute, but very cheap looking, very thin, for the cost."
2.0,The paint came off after a day or 2 of wearing it
2.0,"VERY thin material, to where you could see where the dress had two layers and where it had one. The yellow is also much uglier than the picture. It fits well and was flattering, but not worth the price. If it was $10 I may have tried to make it work- not at all worth the near $30.<br />Returned"
2.0,"The workmanship is fine, but there are 3 issues:  The pocket on this item is so small that it might hold a phone and some tissues, but nothing more.  Also, the weight of the scarf will hardly support the weight of a standard iPhone, so the weight pulls it down.  The last issue surprised me.  I bought the scarf in a fuscia color, but the zipper is white.  It is not a ""blind"" insert, so you have to continue to turn that part of the scarf under or the white zipper insert is visible."
2.0,"I love the design of the swimsuit. It is absolutely darling but the top runs small( I typically wear a large due to bust). The material shows every little extra roll so not very flattering if you have a tummy or a less than perfect body. The skirt fit well but again, not going to be a slim your shape."
2.0,They are small on an average adults head and the sides press into your head.  It also looks like your looking thru a gold fish bowl. The safety shields come out really far forward.
2.0,"Wonderful packaging, and great case but.....I noticed a little scratch on the left lens. But thought I always ruin them in three/four months anyway, I will just keep them. So off to work, direct sunlight in my face and I started getting a headache, and kept thinking my eyes were blurry too. 25 minutes on the road and I arrived, eyes hurting and a worse headache. I then started looking at things closer, and even tried to read some local signs in my parking lot. It was then I noticed my head tilting up and down, searching for a clear spot. Well, the lenses were distorted, with only a slight area in the middle being clear, or better stated not distorted. Perhaps the bend, hard to say, they really didn't fit well in the frame and they were extremely thin. Bummed, nice looking but just not quality lenses."
2.0,I bought this bracelet for myself.  It was advertised as a woman’ Bracelet but I couldn’t get it on my wrist.  My wrist aren’t big either.  It fit my 6 year old granddaughter.  Very disappointed!!!
2.0,They were way smaller than advertised. I need to send them back. Also I did not realize they were canvas.
2.0,They are not comfortable when you are engorged. The padding should be removable.
2.0,I just did not like this on me.  It was too big and I could barely see.  This might not be the case for some but I wouldn't buy it again.
2.0,"This dress is do disproportionate.  The top is snug but the bottom almost has too much flare. But the worst issue is the material. It's like a stiff, brocade type stuff. It reminds me of old, thickly lined curtains from the 70s. Won't ever wear it-going in the yard sale bag."
2.0,I went to try it on but it doesn't fit.
2.0,It stretches out making the black look gray. Not cute... at least not on me<br />I'm 5' 2&#34; 165 36DD
2.0,Hugely too large!!  Drug the floor...front and back! I could pull the waist up OVER my breasts and it STILL drug the floor...and I am 5'7!
2.0,"The leather cracks, poor quality. Beware!"
2.0,"I was so excited for this dress, but was so disappointed when I opened it up, not because the dress wasn’t as expected but the fact that I was sent a dress that looked like it was worn and then returned and sent to the next person. Definitely returning and hoping it doesn’t get sent to another person."
2.0,"What follows is my review of four WearOS smartwatches. The third of these is the Diesel Fadelight.<br /><br />The value and usefulness of a smart watch depends on two things: the device, and the software. A few years I moved out of the Apple ecosystem, so my recent smart watches have all been based on Google's WearOS, an Android-based system. Unlike Apple's closed world, WearOS is intended to be used by many different device manufacturers, with different ideas about what these devices should look like. This is an interesting challenge.<br /><br />I presently have four WearOS  devices:<br />(1) Mobvoi Ticwatch Pro<br />(2) Skagen Falster 2<br />(3) Diesel Fadelight<br />(4) Michael Kors Bradshaw<br /><br />These four devices have three different control configurations and two different screen technologies. Thus although all are WearOS devices, I interact with them in quite different ways.<br /><br />The Ticwatch Pro was one of the first ""second generation"" smartwatches for WearOS, and I understand that Google worked closely with them on it. It's the bulkiest of the four, and has a two layer screen (a bright, colored, hi-res display and a low-power monochrome overlay). This gives it a degree of ""always on"" use without the color display draining the battery. It has two buttons, and no crown (clickable rotatable button). This means that every selection of a new application, or scrolling through messages or notifications, involves swiping on the screen. This didn't seem like a particularly big deal until I got the Skagen; since then I hardly ever use the Ticwatch. Ease of use matters.<br /><br />My second WearOS device is the Skagen Falster 2. It's a lightweight utilitarian watch married to a cheap and cheerful yellow silicone strap, which works just fine. It has a crown and two buttons, and each button can be assigned to launch a specific app. (I tend to use button 1 for Google Fit and button 2 for Weather.) I really like this watch, and only gave it up because something even better came along.<br /><br />Watch number three is the Diesel Fadelight. I really can't recommend it. Physically, it looks like a rather chunky watch module snapped into a stiff clear vinyl strap. It's not very comfortable, and the buckle is awkward. The Fadelight has a crown, but no buttons, so there's no way to launch an app quickly. (Launching an app takes four actions: click to turn on the screen, click again to show the apps, scroll or swipe to the app, and click or tap to launch. On the Skagen, I simply double-click the assigned button.)<br /><br />And then I got the Michael Kors Bradshaw, which has become my favorite watch. Firstly, it looks and feels just right: it's got a navy blue aluminum case and multilink band, with an optional blue silicone strap. It reminds me of my old Citizen SkyHawk, which I wore for many years. It just looks right. For controls, we have a crown and two buttons, like the Falster 2, and I was able to set it up to work just the same in a couple of minutes. Compared to the other three, it comes with an amazing range of faces. Some are the kind of ""bling"" that I would never use, but others demonstrate a tasteful combination of style and function.<br /><br />One more point: charging. The Ticwatch Pro uses a custom charging dock, with four contact pads. The other three all seem to use the same white magnetic two-pin charger, which mates with the sensor module on the watch which is set inside two contact rings. I'm glad to see some standardization emerging here.  (It's also worth mentioning that the dual display of the Ticwatch Pro didn't prove to be a big advantage. With ""tilt to wake"" turned on, all four watches have 24 hour battery life, which is good enough for me.)"
2.0,These sounded fantastic in the ad. I really liked the idea of memory foam house shoes. I was so disappointed when by the third day the cushion was virtually gone. They look good and feel good the memory foam support notwithstanding.
2.0,Such a beautiful shoe. Very classy but I could hardly walk in them. The lining was so slippery that even barefoot my foot was sliding and they pinched my toes so bad I couldn't walk in them 5 minutes.
2.0,The pattern is cute and the flare was perfect  the price was alright. But the fabric 🤢 it was extremely itchy and scratchy. I couldn’t stand them. I even shaved my legs and they were still unbearable.
2.0,I bought this for my daughter for her birthday. She did not feel the price matches the quality at all. The t-shirt she received was Hanes brand with an iron on graphic.
2.0,"I really wanted this dress to work, but it was see through and the seams were very poorly stictched (only one stitch) for the price it wasn't worth keeping so i returned! The dress was very flattering I just wish it was made with better material and quality hem work.."
2.0,Looks a lot better online than in person
2.0,Really cute swim suit. However the torso is very short. I wear an American size six and am 5'8. It was way to short for me.
2.0,"I ordered this bracelet specifically for the blue color. Bracelet that arrived had only some blue rhinestones on only one strap. It is all beige, NOT BLUE. Very disappointed.  Won't order from this vendor again."
2.0,In the picture you can clearly see the design and reddish color in the frames.  When I got them they just look like plain brown.  I was disappointed.
2.0,Broke right away!
2.0,"I am 5”9 and I weigh 210. I ordered an XL. It doesn’t hit the ground as I expected. In addition, the material is cheap and see through."
2.0,They are true to size as you see them on line.
2.0,"The material is so cheap and shows the wrinkles a LOT. I had to add a lot of filler in the bottom part of the cups in order to smooth it out even more (even if my boobs filled it, the wrinkles would still show). Do yourself a favor and get the original TRIANGL suits - this is not worth it. I only kept it because I had a trip to Miami and this was a last minute bikini purchase."
2.0,"This product was made with low quality fabric, poor design fit. I should have returned it for a refund."
2.0,"Only good to wear around the house, arrives in a pile of wrinkles would not recommend these for any other reason."
2.0,I love everything about this shirt...except for the hole that was in the seam of the left sleeve. I didn't want to deal with the return process so I had my partner sew it up. It was pretty disappointing to get something damaged or poorly constructed.
2.0,"Looks really chincy and arrived looking used. Also, the “rose gold” was not rose gold at all."
2.0,The style is very nice but it fits too small and the fabric has no give to it
2.0,Model must be about 4 ft tall!! I'm slightly  taller than the average woman at 5-11. I weigh about 160 and usually wear a medium. This dress runs really small. The waistline hits just below the boobs and the pockets are in an awkward location. It’s going back.
2.0,"The color doesn't match. It is very thin fabric, very wrinkled,  doesn't flare much. The quality is much cheaper than expected."
2.0,I had to super glue the head together because the sticky parts were not that sticky. It kept coming apart. But other than that....this item was a hit.
2.0,I was expecting them to be bigger than they are.
2.0,The material is like a cheap nightgown. The sleeves were tight and everything else was super loose. The hem drags the ground. Sadly didn’t open right away and it’s too late to return. Don’t waste your money on this one girls. 😞
2.0,"I have this brand In this size from a boutique, this is not the same sizing. Too small"
2.0,Zipper broke after 2 times wearing it
2.0,"I've used this to wash a few of my hats. After I used it the first time, the plastic liner was bent, permanently bending my hats on the top to to the side. I tried bending the plastic liner back, but it continues to bend all of my hats, making them look like one side is higher at the top."
2.0,"Was hoping this jacket would be of better quality, I read the description and size chart.  Interior packaging was ripped Sizing is not accurate for women's XL.  I am a size 8 but like jackets XL - not close.  Going back today,"
2.0,Threw it away after it turned to a rusted color. Don't waste your money.
2.0,"I got this for my sister as a birthday present. I ordered a 3X since she likes her sweaters big and cozy. I tried it on for myself to make sure it would be big enough, and it fits like a US Small. And the material feels like that of a cheap Halloween costume. I don't recommend buying this sweater, and I don't recommend buying from this company."
2.0,This item runs quite small.
2.0,Neckline uncomfortable for me.
2.0,I bought this for my daughter. Girls Ballerina could not please her. It is not the correct size and low quality. We no longer buy Soda Tart Girl's Ballerina Flats Patent
2.0,Too large I’m a size medium and some times a large. After reading the reviews I decided to get a medium and it’s still entirely too big
2.0,These came in bent and mangled. I've been pressing them for a few weeks to see if that will straighten out the tentacles.
2.0,"The dress was fine, but too large for me.  I ordered two and returned BOTH AT THE SAME TIME, using an amazon return on the box.  However, I got credit back on ONLY ONE DRESS so far.  This is odd and very annoying."
2.0,Rather spend more money for better brand
2.0,"This line is made for tiny Spanish women. I am a small usually, but both the medium and large are too small for me."
2.0,The smallest part of my body is my waist.  I am ALWAYS a medium.  I couldn't zip this around my smaller waist. Chest fit fine.  I'm sure you can find a similar on the site.  Go with something else.
2.0,"These are just socks, NOT AT ALL COMPRESSION for the average person. Probably will compress very obese legs. I'm overweight and they offer NO compression AT ALL. My tube socks fit tighter. Very disappointed, I have enough regular socks, I need compression socks when I work 12 hour shifts standing 90% of the shift."
2.0,"The stems are too long to fit comfortably in the nose, the screws peek out the nostrils, and the studs are so tiny you can barely see them. The bone style won't stay in at all, so be prepared to lose them quick."
2.0,I'm usually a medium but something told me size down so I got a small and it fit. BUT it's like a swimsuit material so it's shiney and cheap looking.<br />It is cute but I didn't like the material at all. Return
2.0,Muy simples no me gustaron
2.0,"Stem is too short, will not even fit a kid well."
2.0,they were nice sandals but were way to narrow.  The strap came across an awkward place on my toes.  Very uncomfortable.
2.0,Not sweater material. Not as cute as the picture. Cheaply made.
2.0,I do not use it because i hear it can damage debit cards'
2.0,Looks nice but not what I expected
2.0,Was small and ripped after first use
2.0,"I figured for the price it wouldn't be great, but this is impressively cheap looking."
2.0,"This product fit, but is already breaking apart at most used belt hole.  I would not buy again."
2.0,bottom fits wiered..
2.0,Way too small. Also feels cheaply made
2.0,I thought this would be a perfect necklace for my niece. Except when it arrived some of the stones  were chipped. Sadly I didn’t want to give her the necklace in that condition so it is hanging in my closet. I wore it once and received compliments. But...when you buy something new it should not have flaws. How the person who packaged the necklace did not notice I have no idea? It was the first thing I noticed when I opened it. Disappointing
2.0,"Points bent and one cracked from box being too small,other than that good size and quality."
2.0,The fabric feels like cheap swimsuit material. It was slightly large and just fit oddly all around.
2.0,The breathable filter is flimsy and fell right out of the mask after only a couple of uses. Would be great product if filter was secure.
2.0,I do not recommend for big breasted women.
2.0,Fit like a glove…. No give.
2.0,Frayed after first use. Daughter walked around amusement park and the fabric frayed after the first hour.
2.0,"Not even close to the real size. Ordered 2x and it fits my daughter that wears a size 14. Cute cut, like the lil flair, nice material but way too small."
2.0,These are thinner material than Dragonfit brand. Returned these to get better quality shorts for my wife.
2.0,"Though the bracelet looks great in the photo, when I put it on the smaller bands of leather cracked significantly and also slid down so that some of them were over my skin, looking much sloppier than the way it looks in the photo."
2.0,"Cheap material, looks like a Halloween costume. Not as pictured. Would not buy again."
2.0,"Wax Jeans size seven is usually my go to when ordering jeans online. I know exactly how the fit so it means I can trust them (fairly tightly fitted without a lot of elastic), and they don't have the problem of getting baggy after one wear.<br /><br />This time thought they arrived with a giant hole in the leg... Maybe the colored fabrics are made more cheaply made than the denim :(."
2.0,The fabric sticks to everything causing snags overtime you move.  One inkling of static and forget ti your hair will stand on its end.  Short and not for the full busted figure.  If your a teen this is for you.  Not even good for a cover up.
2.0,I’m 5’10 145 ordered a medium and it barely covered my bottom.  Wish I could wear it.
2.0,"the owl on my shirt came in a different color, instead of brown it is yellow. The shirt feels comfy but also again with looks isn't of a batwing style."
2.0,"I ordered this dress a couple times because I love the fit and the pockets! But! I ordered the army green color, and it came lime! I previously ordered the purply, the burgundy, and the dark green and they were all so bright - not like in the photo. I have a gray one and a navy one I will continue to wear, but I don't think I will buy another and chance getting the wrong color.<br /><br />If you're planning on buying, buy a gray or a black - I do not think those colors can be messed up."
2.0,Had to give them away to a very thin person as they ran extremly small ...
2.0,Very oversized! I ordered a small and the tag came OS (one size)
2.0,"I ordered this garment for my Harley Quinn costume.  It was made better than I thought it would be and would have been perfect.  I went by the seller's instructions and ordered a size up.  It fit my waist but not my bust.  In order for the straps to fit you, you will have to have either very small breast and a very small frame.  I ordered an XXL, where I would wear a med to XL.  My daughter wears a small.  The XXL fit my daughter (who has a 28 inch waist and a 32 bust line).  The seller offered a refund with a 20% restocking fee, so basically you are paying them to take it back."
2.0,"I have severely flat, wide feet. I thought these might help at work. They don’t; my feet hurt more than before. The side on the inner part of the foot, cuts into my feet where an arch is for a narrow-footed person. These seem to be for people with arches or at least with a narrower foot, so you may have different results."
2.0,I ordeted a 3XL which is larger than my normal size so the jacket fit ok. The shirt & pants were way to small they were defective not a 3XL they were more like large maybe even a medium. I do not recommend ordering unless your a size 5 and under.
2.0,Really cheap looking and the buckle doesn't look as pretty as the picture
2.0,The color of the stones were an orange hue and its way too big for my wrist. I was hoping this would be a new nice piece of jewelry but it turned out not so nice.
2.0,These ran VERY small.
2.0,Fits more like a kids large
2.0,WRONG COLOR:
2.0,"If you’re expecting this to look like the picture, don’t bother buying it. It’s a hit or miss. If you like gambling, go for it."
2.0,Not happy with product at all however they offered my 50 % back and keep it  If I wanted to return it was on my dime
2.0,The band fit the watch but it does fit as well as the original one did.
2.0,Not good.  Bad quality due to inferior metal quality and paint.  Ended up returning it.
2.0,"Painted on the metal. I never wear it. It's very heavy too. I probably wouldn't recommend it if you get migraines in the back of your neck because it's a little heavy. To me, since it's painted, it looks inexpensive."
2.0,Didn't really feel like a real shoe.
2.0,Pain scratches off easily when you take the earrings on and off.
2.0,"I love the feel of the shirt,  but it runs really small. I normally wear a medium and ordered a large because I wanted it roomy. Well I put I on and it was soooo snug. I am really disappointed."
2.0,Shrunk alot after first wear
2.0,Didn't delivery the right hoodie. 👎🏻
2.0,did not have wallet for 2 weeks before aipper is already splitting
2.0,"I have pretty large feet so I've been purchasing Wigwam crew socks for years.  When I received my latest order and put on a pair, I could tell immediately they were smaller.  I checked the size on the package & it was indeed what I normally purchase.  Time to find another manufacturer."
2.0,Dress is great if you don’t have to wear a bra. If you tape or use sticky bras you will see every little line. There is absolutely no side coverage so your bra will show.
2.0,The outfit looks adorable but my daughter wore it one time and the seams started to open.  By the time she made it home from school the crotch was completely open and one of her legs
2.0,Unfortunately one eye fell off the second time my baby used them. The eye is so small that can be easily ingested by a baby.
2.0,There are no tags so I can’t tell what is the front or pack. I ordered the white color and I got Purple. The fabric is lint the best. I am normally a small and it’s too big.
2.0,Worked for a bit but they said scratch resistant and they definitely weren’t. The color on the glasses almost completely scratched off just from normal wear for a few months.
2.0,This was ok price but it looks weird. I returned it
2.0,Made very cheap. Snap is off center.
2.0,I don’t like it because looks different than in the picture
2.0,"These shoes are beautiful and the shoe bed is cushioned so they are very comfortable.  However, the sizing of the strap is off so the shoes don’t really stay in place while you’re walking and the jewels don’t stay on the shoe, which means eventually and easily they will break off."
2.0,In spending 100 on a robe I was anticipating better quality on the fabric. Instead the fabric is the same that you have on graduation gowns. This is not satin at all.
2.0,The black plastic-covered band shredded within a month of purchase.
2.0,didn't fit good
2.0,"Not as pictured. The hips fit perfectly but the pants were far too long, and were very obviously pajama pants instead of workout/sweat pants. The legs were not tapered and instead were more of a boot cut."
2.0,"This looked too small on my wide wrist, so it's going back. The bar did not reach to each side of my wrist. It also looked a little tarnished on the sides."
2.0,"Pros: Shipping was very fast, very cute design, true to size for my kid.<br />Cons: Lace in the front slips down which can make this inappropriate for a child, lace in the back ripped on first wear, strap tore on first wear.<br />I wouldn't recommend wouldn't purchase again."
2.0,The style is ok but bad quality.
2.0,"Seem to be well enough made, but they're a LOT smaller than my other bras labeled the same.  They're also itchy.  Definitely wouldn't purchase again."
2.0,This item is very uncomfortable. Wish it had hook & eyes for the crotch
2.0,"While I loved the pattern, I was not happy with the material (thin and shiny) nor the fit which was too large.  I was looking for a heavier sweatshirt material.  It seemed to have been made well though."
2.0,They fit pretty well on size 13 extra wide feet<br /> A little hard getting used to walking on them. Not cushiony for me so are making my feet hurt.
2.0,"These buttons might work for a child's blazer or jacket, but they are too small to be used for a Men's Blazer.  The buttons are a disappointment."
2.0,They were bulky and uncomfortable.
2.0,"This was a let down. Low quality fabric, and not really a good fit. Odd fit in fact, and returning things to this company is really hard.  They make you pay to send it back. I was not happy with the quality, the style or the service. I am going to donate it to my youth group."
2.0,"I returned it, cute bag but the way they shipped it, it had a a huge fold in the middle of it that didn't come out after a month, and even though I hung it in my garage for a month, it still had an overwhelming offensive plastic smell from the lining inside actually made me sick to my stomach"
2.0,Too thick!
2.0,"Very see threw, have to use as a night gown."
2.0,I’m all about flowy dresses but this felt like a frumpy bag lady dress. Nothing about it feels as though it fits and therefore it adds pounds to your appearance and looks like a muumuu (even though I’m all about comfort.)
2.0,Not tshirt  material.
2.0,The battery stopped working after only a week or two.
2.0,very tiny 0 best for a child or a second earring.
2.0,"Super cute! And as described. Bought for my 4 year old and bracelets too big 😕 and that was ok, eventually will grow but the shiny beads have spikes that scratched her neck. Can only be worn for a little bit."
2.0,I'll wear them but I wouldn't purchase again.
2.0,Haven't washed this yet the fringe at the bottom looks like it's been washed. Wouldn't buy this again.
2.0,super super small and very cheaply made-I returned it
2.0,looked too cheap
2.0,"These are super cute, but they looked a little tarnished and ended up hurting my ears after the first night. I am pretty sure if you change them out often the back hook will break."
2.0,It does not tie around the neck like the picture. It is not the style I really wanted . Not true to picture that was when I bought it. It's like it's missing a strap.
2.0,It was pricey but I thought it would be a good mask. I was wrong .
2.0,"They did not fit to size. I have to return them. However, they are nice looking slippers for children."
2.0,I don't like the elastic around the cap.
2.0,This wasnt what i ordered way to small and not like picture
2.0,Cute but a little big and cheaply made. Ripped first time wearing it. Would not buy again.
2.0,"Actual bag color is more mustard, not yellow. I didn't like it but my friend loved the color so I gave it to her. Had a strange odor to it, remove from the smell with fabreeze."
2.0,Love how they look on and love how they shade the sun but they fall off if I look down wish they could be tighter
2.0,I love the color of the jacket and also like how well insulated it is and the length is awesome for when the weather is freezing and windy out. Only down fall is the next day after receiving the jacket I wore it and went to grab something from my pocket and the button snapped off .
2.0,"It’s a very pretty necklace, but it broke within a week of getting it."
2.0,"For the price, I didn't return them, but on half of the earrings, the stones were not attached straight! It's not worth it to try to fix them, they are glued, but they would be perfect if they were all straight. Very nice for the price. I wearing them to work and they look great."
2.0,They didn’t fit right.
2.0,These masks are made in China!  It says nothing about where they are manufactured in the description!!  They are wide enough but the vertical height is a little short.  The material is really light and when worn there are gaps around the nose and sides. It provides very little protection from germs!
2.0,The Nefertiti earrings are cute.I wish they were a little better quality. They are paper thin plus they come with plastic earring backs.
2.0,I only received 3 and they were honestly expensive for how tiny they are. They are pretty but just very small and pricy.
2.0,"Fit was alright, but it looked cheap... I was looking for an elopement dress so wasn't expecting the best quality, but this was underwhelming for me... might work as a casual beach dress or something though."
2.0,"I'm disappointed with this purchase, I couldn't use because the arm strap is very small and it looks funny on my shoulder. I can't return it since I got busy and it's been a while since I noticed it"
2.0,Way to big. The small fits like a dress on me. Looks more like an xxxlarge.  Maybe a xxsmall would fit me.  The material is nice though.  So disappointed I was so looking forward to wearing this of it were to fit.  Had to return it.
2.0,Fits as expected. However it makes some weird sound as you walk. It sounds as if you were walking around with a kid's shoe that has puts out some sort of sound...Not sure what it is but certainly does not seem right with a men's sandal
2.0,"I ordered this to wear on mother’s day and love the minty green color buuuut it was a bit larger than I expected which I could deal with but the bigger issue is it has a cut/slice/tear in the fabric of the skirt a couple inches above the hem of the skirt in the very front! So now I have to return it (for a smaller size while I’m at it) but don’t get to wear on mother’s day. I even got a cute vintage purse to match and coordinating heels and belt 😢 For sizing reference, I ordered an XL and am 5’9” 188lbs with a 38” busy and 30” waist. (Side note: I ordered hoping I could still nurse in it and you can)"
2.0,"I bought these due to the positive reviews but either I got a bad pair or something is wrong with me I guess because my fingers are still freezing in these gloves. I live about 1/4 mile from our mailbox so I normally take the lawn tractor down and my fingers always freeze in whatever gloves I have tried, even Columbia gloves that ran me close to $100. I should not have expected much for $30 but I though maybe I would get lucky, I did not. They are very comfortable to wear even though the fingertips are a bit awkward just like most all gloves that have any sort of padding in them. I have not tested the waterproof factor of them as I did not have to snowblow or plow yet since I just got the gloves last night. You would think they would be able to keep my fingers warm for a few minute drive down and back so I am not very confident in how they will be when plowing (same tractor - John Deere 425 if that matters with no cab so it's open to the elements) or snowblowing.<br />Who knows, maybe it is something with me and all the gloves I have tried work great for everyone else....With how cold my fingers are though, I would hate to try them on a snowmobile or even skiing."
2.0,"Too deep I feel like I have a top hat on, I won’t wear it!"
2.0,These are fairly comfortable but they tear so easily it kind of defeats the purpose.
2.0,When I say it runs small that doesn't really cover it. If you wear a medium order a 3x. Really. It runs very very very small.
2.0,Very uncomfortable and not true to size.  It's an okay buy if you are desperate and have no other option.  Would not recommend.
2.0,The color does not match the piture
2.0,This is made for very tiny people. I'm a normal sized woman and these looked like doll clothes.
2.0,"This is a very comfortable jacket. But, not a rain jacket. I was in the rain for about 20 minutes before the water soaked right through to my clothes."
2.0,"While the dress fit fine, the arms were a bit tighter than expected. The seam going down the front and back of this dress looks bizarre, and the difference in fabric between the top and the bottom of the dress was off-putting. The top seemed like it was very poor quality, thin material, and the bottom portion of the dress is made with a far thicker material - it just doesn't match. However, that is not what makes this dress unwearable. What makes it unwearable is the fact that the slit down the front goes all the way down to the waist, and the only thing holding it together is a singular cheap craft button hand sewed on, with only two stitches in each hole.<br /><br />Needless to day I will be returning it ASAP, as the dress was a complete waste of money."
2.0,Pretty small beanie
2.0,Small size. Barely fits my head.
2.0,Very bulky and big
2.0,"When I tried this on, it looked nothing like what I expected it to look like based on the image provided."
2.0,The fit was great but it had a hole about a quarter size above  the slit.
2.0,"2 stars because they work fine as cufflinks, and from far don't look too bad, but close up look like 3 thin pieces of lego stuck together."
2.0,Lenses are like a dark smoke grey when looking through them instead of black don't like this product still love locs though other products i've tried are great
2.0,The red and white are fitting normal but the black shirt is extremely tight I can barely fit into it without it digging into my armpits. The other 2 are very loose how I like it. I don’t want to return it because I love the fit of the other ones. Unacceptable
2.0,"For those of you who might have a larger chest, this dress might not be the right fit"
2.0,I really wanted to like these shoes. I was hoping they would work out for my 5 y/o to wear for our family pictures. They seem to be cheaply made. They were way too wide and loose on her. Such a bummer.
2.0,"This shirt looked nice above the waist. The colors were correct, the fit was perfect, the material was ok (kind of shiny and see thru on the white part. The reason I gave the shirt 2 stars is because the third panel on the bottom of the shirt that has the horizontal stripes was rediculously long! I'm just under 5'4&#34;. The shirt fell just above my knees about 3 inches above.  The striped panel was at least a foot long. It looked out of place on the shirt. I felt like the clothing maker had extra stripped fabric and didn't want to waste any. ..so they made the shirt look like pajamas for an inmate. I returned it."
2.0,"Way too small, misleading, had to return. Couldn't fit my cell phone."
2.0,"I've only used one color (Green) so far and the top band is holding the same fun color but the bottom band is getting much darker. Almost like an Army green. Very strange.<br /><br />I do like the way the band clasps together, just wish the color would hold"
2.0,"Too small in the bust and arm area area.  I wear a size 8-10 and I ordered a large, and it was tight in all the wrong places."
2.0,Way smaller than we expected. Hard to recline. More for a child than an adult.
2.0,For petites way to bagy
2.0,"I really loved this earrings when I first got them, then my ears broke out and they were unbearable to wear. It's a shame bc I really loved the way they looked."
2.0,"It's nice material, so that's a plus. But I was going for a casual fit not a big man fit. This shirt runs large so depending on the fit you are going for, sizing down would probably be a good option."
2.0,Its wasn't what i expected..........
2.0,Love the look of the band.  I received this in January. I have several other watch bands so I don’t wear this everyday. I went to use it yesterday and it’s coming apart
2.0,You get what you pay for! Cheap quality and not worth even it’s $4
2.0,"I was so excited when I found these shorts!! However, when I got them, they were a huge! I got small but they fit like an XL! The material is very well made and the color is STUNNING!! They are also very comfortable!! Definitely worth buying just make sure to keep in mind they run VERY LARGE!! I wish I would have known before purchasing 😭"
2.0,"I have already responded to this review once. They were to small, even after ordering a larger size than my normal. Plus, the leather looked really good on pic, but are plastic looking in person. Took really loooong time to arrive, so not going to bother returning due to price."
2.0,Wallet was the same size as my last that I had owned for over 10 years. I have had this wallet for two weeks and it is already falling apart! In two different locations on the wallet there is a tear were it folds and another section tore off from the stitching.
2.0,Really poor quality. Material is very thin.
2.0,"This is NOT a good binder if you like your ribs and breathing. It is not at all stretchy width-wise other than a strip of elastic on the left side, which is extremely dangerous. It is also a bit too small, and I'm a tiny person to begin with. I can't put it on over my head at all; I had to close the clasps after I had it on already. I can feel the tiny bit of elastic stretch with every breath. If you must get this, go a size up at the very least. I may modify it to make the back stretchy, but this is simply not a safe binder as-is."
2.0,Design is not even<br />Very different from pictures
2.0,"It’s child size, was looking to replace my old watch with something different but it’s so small"
2.0,Not great just ok
2.0,Not as cute as I thought it would be. 2 separate materials in the shirt. I think you need to be size 2 or 4 to make this one work.
2.0,Fit perfectly on top and in waist but thigh area was too tight couldn't sit down
2.0,Does not fit the apple watch series 4 as described
2.0,Item didn’t fit
2.0,I love Clic readers and have been using them for years so I was excited to see they're making a polarized bifocal sunglass version.  I immediately ordered a pair. I received them promptly as usual.  The lens quality is excellent and having them bifocal is such a convenient plus. However these were not the glasses for me. I found the lens frame to be overly large and somewhat heavy. Call me unenlightened but the styling seemed to favor women. Perhaps it was the rhinestones on the sides. Ultimately I returned this pair and will await other styles to be offered.
2.0,The dress is nice however I could not wear it for the occasion because it has a big orange stain on it
2.0,its pretty but comes off too easy
2.0,The small size was like larg size
2.0,Shirt fits great but the color is way off and it’s poorly sewn together. It’s coming apart at the seems after one wear.
2.0,Print looks horrible and it's orange not red and it's centered bad.. but I have to wear it kuz it's for a party and had it rushed
2.0,"The slippers are as cute as the picture looks.  We bought these along with the Dalmation pair.  Both set of slippers have received extremely minimal use and both are losing their stitches.  The contruction is great, but the detail is where the loose stitches are.  One whole cow spot fell off and the smile on one of the Dalmation's face is almost gone from loose threads.  However, they are easy to put on and the sole is great for quick trips outdoors."
2.0,This shirt is extremely extremely small and honestly seems like child sizes. I ordered a size up and I still could not fit it even completely on my body. Go up 2 sizes and maybe even 3. I usually wear a size large and that is somewhat loose on me and ordered an XL in this but it is skin tight and wouldn’t go completely over my arms.
2.0,"It feels like a high quality polyester satin fabric…not a cotton poly blend. I thought it was sizing so I washed it, it’s pretty but doesn’t feel like cotton. I’ll probably end up donating it."
2.0,Cheap see through material and ran way too small especially around the hips!
2.0,"It may be a good watch, but if you have any level of farsightedness (i.e. most people over 40), everything about this watch is tiny including the display and the controls.  If you can see very small things, you probably can't beat the price.  I should have thought of this when I bought it."
2.0,"very poor quality .looks good i purchase it,but regret it after a month it change rapidly turn black,will not recommend to no one to buy.."
2.0,The Youth small was very large - more like an adult small.  The printing was just okay.  My 4 year old loved it all the same but it'll probably be relegated to a pajama or dress up shirt than something he can wear normally.
2.0,Had to return these because the boys size 4-6 runs way too large.  Other than that they would have been perfect.
2.0,"These fit weird, they want to 'ride down', but they're not too big. Also the fabric isn't very soft, almost nylonish."
2.0,"Cute shirt getting the 2 stars, however; this company only has one pattern size and that is SMALL.  From previous reviews, they said that the blouse ran a little small.  I would say, that small is their ONLY size.  I ordered a 2X hoping it would fit my L size, but not luck.  I will not return it due to postage to return this blouse would cost more than the original purchase."
2.0,Flimsy... It's not made to be worn outside. It's fine as indoor slippers/booties. Shipped in a plastic bag so it was wrinkled and bent.
2.0,Feel and look pretty cheap.
2.0,"looks good, material is good but the time after 2 days you need to set it again, looks the chronometer is behind, its always late for couple of minutes every 24 hours. will not recommend"
2.0,"love the look, but lens popped out upon arrival and frame around lens broke within 2 weeks."
2.0,This bag comes with 3 accordion zipped pockets.<br />The front has a smaller pocket that is wide open. It’s too short for an iPhone XS or sunglasses.<br />The back two pockets are the exact same.<br />Each pocket is divided in half with one half having an open area and a wallet slot area with 3 slots and a back deep slot. And the other half having an open area and an ID card slot.<br />I really wish the two back pockets didn’t have the divider. It makes the areas almost too small to use.<br />The deep slot behind the 3 card slots is too tight to put anything and retrieve is successfully. Even a pen won’t work.<br />My iPhone XS fits nicely into one of the bigger pocket halves but I wouldn’t want to put anything else (besides cards) in the other half as I wouldn’t be able to zip it up.<br />The purse comes with two handed. One that’s adjustable for cross body or over the shoulder and one for carrying more like a clutch.<br />The hooks are a little tight to get on but they swivel which is nice.
2.0,"I LOVE THE STYLE OF THIS SHIRT AND THE COLOR AND FIT ARE OK.  HOWEVER, I DO DETEST CHEAP AND FILMSY MATERIAL CHOICES MADE BY THE MANUFACTURER!  I MUCH PREFER PAYING MORE AND GETTING GOOD QUALITY MATERIAL THAT DOESN'T SHOW THROUGH, HAS NO BODY, AND BECOMES MORE FILMSY AND LIMPER WITH EVERY  WASH."
2.0,The sleeves are not lined. Felt very cheaply made. Not worth the money. Nothing like pictured.
2.0,"These are horrible. The crotch is extremely low so it looks like underwear when you’re wearing them, not shorts. And yes, I know they’re meant to be very short, but they’re not like short shorts at all, more like high wasted underwear. They’re too large and too small at the same time. Cut is just odd. Not flattering. Also the material is like bathing suit material, so if you have even the smallest “FUPA” (I’m 5’5” 140lbs/ size 5) do not consider these. Extremely unflattering."
2.0,If these are linen they are the cheapest roughest feeling linen shorts I've ever come across. They are also quite see through even with nude underwear. The only thing remotely linen about them is how wrinkled they came out of the dryer. They certainly didn't have that light airy soft linen feel.
2.0,These were so cut but I definitely needed some stretch which didn't exist
2.0,"even tho its cheap, its not even worth its price! :("
2.0,Not worth even ordering my 6 year old grandson tore through them.  The print was cool
2.0,"The dress is not very well made. It should have cost less than $10 if it was going to look as if I had sewn it together myself (I am Not a seamstress)<br />Whoever it does fit well, I just wished it looked better because I planned on wearing it to an event on Friday. I am 5’1 & weigh about 140, I bought a large but a medium would have probably fit ( I don’t wear my clothes tight fitting or snug)  It does come almost all the way to my ankles in length"
2.0,no breast support and the dress is too small even with following the size chart. was not satisfied because I cant even wear it. the dress is pretty but the top part needs work.
2.0,"The material is very thick, definitely not see through, that part was great. However, even though they're ""seamless"", there is a thick waistband at the top. The waistband has much more compression than the rest of the leggings, so it pushed my fat down, and as soon as the waistband stops, there was a bulge of fat around my hips. Accentuated the love handles/muffin top instead of smoothing them. And I am a small - I don't even have that much fat, it just really made it look worse! Bummer, because otherwise I liked the fabric."
2.0,Ripped after 2wears seams under the arms
2.0,"The pattern is cute & colors are true to the picture. Unfortunately the fabric is quite shiny. Definitely not a cotton/poly blend.  I sized up for my toddler, and it was a little large."
2.0,"Everything I read sounded simply perfect but each time I wore  them and/or washed them I found that something had gone wrong.  The 100% cotton is unwieldly from the get go but after each wash the garment shrinks which makes it even more unwieldly.  While the top is sufficiently large the jacket buttons nevertheless keep popping open with wear.  Very annoying.  I've washed these jamas only three times now but can't stand the thought of wearing them again so off they go to Goodwill.  Will have to choose my purchases more carefully, I guess."
2.0,"This smells like fish for some reason. The other reviews stated it had a funky smell, but it quite literally smells like old fish."
2.0,It cost me $40 for this purse. The first time I used it the inside fabric came comepletely undone rendering the pockets inside completely useless and leaving the inside where the fabric was sticky and full of a weird yellow powder. When I addressed this with the seller they offer a partial refund of just $6. Complete rip off. DO NOT BUY. All I put inside this purse was a wallet and my phone. I can’t even imagine if I had tried to actually make this purse for my purse everyday use.
2.0,"This dress had so much potential. Unfortunately, it is like wearing a sheet. It has no shape and just drapes over me and the bottom flared section makes my hips look so wide in a bad way. It doesn’t accentuate anything in a good way. The listing photos are photoshopped. There’s a lot of clothes on Amazon with that same model in the same poses; they just cut and paste different clothes on her. Frankly, I am sick of it. It is well-made, I’ll give it that. For reference, I’m 5’5”, 125lbs and normally wear a small, which is what I ordered. If I could have sized down, it wouldn’t help, it’s the lack of shaping that is the problem. I attached a photo comparing it to another dress that fits well. IMO it is overpriced for what you get."
2.0,While this was pretty and a good price it fell apart completely after only 3 weeks. I was disappointed in the quality of this product. Very disappointing. Would not buy anything from them again.
2.0,"I got this product and it’s definitely not the worst sweatshirt, but it’s mot worth the price. The logo seems pretty well on there, but the material of the sweatshirt is spongey. Not what I would want a hoodie to feel like. It would not provide warmth, and mine ran small. The size seems to be all over the place because some reviews said it ran big."
2.0,This is made for a really short guys with really long hands.
2.0,Cute but chain keeps breaking.
2.0,MY SHOES NEVER STINK 'TIL I PUT THESE SOL 3 GEL PADS IN. GROSS.
2.0,"This looks like a really well made suit. I thought I’d just take a chance in the size 10, but it was too small. Wish there were other sizes offered."
2.0,"Pretty, soft, well made<br />Too small"
2.0,"Ended up returning these. They would be pretty comfortable and I'd probably be able to get away with wearing them to work, but there were two issues I really didn't like. First, having functional front pockets is great, but with the odd stiff/stretchy fabric I found that the inside lining of the pockets showed through too much. Second, the pants are cut so that the waist is smaller than the hips. This is actually great for avoiding the dreaded waist gap, but the problem is that the pair I received had non-stretchy thread in the waist. I honestly can't believe I didn't see another review mentioning this, so maybe it was just my pair. Regardless, I was afraid I was going to rip the waist seam when I tried to get them over my hips and they weren't stretching to fit over the booty, so back they go."
2.0,Did hold up as expected
2.0,"It is bigger than on picture and quality is not so good. It's nice, but realisation is bad. Looks like somebody just tried to do something. Not as beautiful as on picture"
2.0,Nice but I do not think they are truly cashmere.
2.0,The material is very thin. It was small and short. Not made for taller women. Not a fan of this outfit
2.0,I loved wearing this skirt over my biking shorts. The fit was great. The fabric was light and wrinkle-resistant. The design was well-suited for biking.<br />I was SO sad when the clasp broke after only wearing it a few times. I’ve tried but can’t repair it.
2.0,"The item pictured is a bit different than in reality, where the logo is 50% bigger on the actual item. Also because I needed a different size, the seller had me buy it directly through their website instead of Amazon (for higher price) and charged me the return shipping."
2.0,El estampado  y el diseño son muy bonitos. Solo la tela y las costuras son de baja calidad.
2.0,Tore on my first time wearing them.
2.0,"Very cheap product, dropped it on ground and glasses broke"
2.0,"Not as cute on as it is in the pic,,"
2.0,Product runs small fits more like a medium/large than XL. Pants fit better than the shirt. the shirt is shorter than expected.
2.0,"It is very cute and as pictured. However, I ordered a large with hopes to fit baggy and comfy, but this was not the case. Definitely order two sizes up if you’re looking for comfortable pjs"
2.0,Not flattering....material isnt soft. Feels roughband stiff. The tie for the side of the dress was longer than it should be so I had to tie it 3 times......ended up deciding to return.
2.0,broke in first 3 weeks
2.0,I would say size. I really struggles putting them on and they were very tight.
2.0,"I bought for my daughter, her second pair of Uggs and these fit much tighter.  Her word was “restrictive”.  So back they went...for this price they need to be comfortable."
2.0,WAY too small. I got a medium which is my normal size and it was super tight. Couldn’t even get it all the way on. I only gave it a second star because it is very shiny.
2.0,two sizes two big! I ordered a size small and I am a 25-26 waist and these feel more like a large. they also hang down in the crotch area. Very disappointed :(.
2.0,Horrible. Fits weird. Hard to explain but I returned it.
2.0,"Has a nice look, but it has 4 points that snags clothing. Overall not a bad purchase."
2.0,I ordered up a size and it was so small I could barely get it over my head. It was very short and I will not be able to wear it.
2.0,Gloves were good until the straps fell apart. Stitching in Velcro straps came undone.
2.0,"This belt is quite small , one size but does not fit most. For people who weigh under 170 I'm under that and it doesn't go completely around"
2.0,They were way to small. However they are nice.
2.0,"Fits okay, but is very thin."
2.0,"Boot fit well otherwise, but top of boot at ankle, the opening was too wide. Stuck out away from back of ankle a good 1/2 inch, made boot look too big."
2.0,The umbrella is very nice but the handle rod was bent and very difficult to operate.
2.0,Nice looking watch but that's where it ends it has a super loud tick with the seconds hand which is a loud tick every second and its very cheap craft it rattles and makes too much noise every time you move your wrist to the point of being to embarrassing to wear all in all a waste of money I wish I would have bought another watch
2.0,Nice looking just small
2.0,I order a 9 month size and its waaaay to big
2.0,in the packet there was only 2 shirts not 3
2.0,"Cute bag however, the zipper broke before the week was over 😑"
2.0,I loved the bracelet whe. I received it it it has faded and so<br />E of the stones have ha ged to a dark ugly color. I am very disappointed
2.0,"Look aweful on, returned it.  I'm 5'7&#34; 145#"
2.0,its very cute and I've received many compliments on it.  But it falls apart in no time. The wings fall off.
2.0,I ordered this because it says slim fitted. It is not. It is a boxy fit.
2.0,Too large!  i ordered the L which the website shows to be size 7.5-8.5 US - they arrived with a tag from the manufacturer which shows L size 9.5-10.  I called and spoke to a representative who could not figure out how to assist or ship the correct size.  I am returning them and will not be reordering since the sizing on the website is not accurate and not the shipping is no longer included as it was when I originally ordered them.
2.0,Van 3 veces que compre este artículo la primera vez fueron bonitas la 2 veces alguna pares venían demasiado pequeñas y ahora sin los colores vienen muy pálidos el rojo se la otra ves es más oscura y es bonita ahora no es pálido y eso con 2-3 lavanda se mirara feo porque se le quita el color creo que esta es la última vez que compro este articulo 👎
2.0,I've only used the bag for about a month and the padding is already starting to shift down in the shoulder strap and the zipper gets stick pretty often. I thought this would be a bag for long term use but it is definitely not.
2.0,Came with a sticker sheet of white dots
2.0,"Extremely dissatisfied, the gloves are extremely thin and tear easily. They provide little to no protection"
2.0,The bottoms are somewhat smaller than expected.  The top was much larger than expected (I double checked the tag to make sure they were sized the same).  They is at least a size or two difference between the top and bottom.
2.0,"It had weird pieces of fabric at the arm seam and at the end of the sleeves. I can't really explain it but it looked like it was a mistake (looking closely at the pictures, I see it was not, but it looks weird any way). It's made from really thin material and wasn't what I expected. Returning it."
2.0,"I have received a discount to review this item honestly:<br />this blouse is not the same as the one advertised in the picture. The crew neck is different. in the picture the fabric is as heavy as the rest of the blouse while for real it is very thin, thus looks like a cheap piece of carnaval  costume. The color is pretty though but I won't wear it."
2.0,Super cute and comfy but I've worn it three times and it is starting to unravel all over.
2.0,"I should have returned these. By the time I wanted to wear them, I realized that the way they curl up was very uncomfortable."
2.0,Nice shirt but the embroidery is very stiff which cause the entire dog face to twist and curl. Does not lay flat. I may try to steam it but it thick so not sure that will help.
2.0,"This “red” buffalo plaid dress is anything but red. It looks like a washed out rose color and faded black. It looks ten years old, not a fan. Missed the return window but wish I could give this back to the seller and ask why it looks so old."
2.0,The waist is different then my last pair.  So it cuts into my stomach.  I don't like them st all
2.0,Es muy grande la talla s parece l
2.0,The 16 inch doesn't fit. Not sure what to do with it now except look at it
2.0,"Very thin, and not very warm"
2.0,Received all crushed up into pieces did return & received a new one very soon but tarnished after awhile. You get what you pay for.
2.0,Cute but do not last long. We are on a second broken pair in one season.
2.0,"There are much better pants available. Buttery soft, yes. But so soft that it shows all my cellulite dimples that I'm working out to loose. Material is lightweight and stretchy but so thin that colored panties show through. The waistband is the worst part. Had to pull it almost up to my bra. It does stay in place but it the elastic twists up inside the fabric. Keep shopping. This ain't it."
2.0,these tops ran small. and shrank.
2.0,The bottom of pants balloon at ankle
2.0,"Original: I'm in love with this pack. Sooo many pockets, more than I know what to do with. (5 stars)<br /><br />Update: I've had the backpack for 3.2 months and it has seriously fallen apart. All of the zipper strings have fallen off, and the laptop sleeve's zipper has come off of the  zipper-line, both of the strap tightening gizmos have broken, making it impossible to change the length of the straps. &quot;Durable Design&quot; is a flat out lie, I've only brought it to school, &quot;Combat Pro&quot; Ha, can barely survive a car ride to a high school. What a joke!"
2.0,"After ordering a 1/2 size smaller, it was a little too big, even with a sock. A thick sock and I was fine. The shoe itself worked fantastically!!  Wore it almost every day from Oct '22 to early Jan'23. That is when starts to fall apart, literally. The stitching where the instep of the foot meets the front toes started to fray. Later on that afternoon, the shoe was useless, it had a zipper effect. I am only giving this 2 stars b/c the shoe itself was very comfortable. Walking 5-6 miles in a day did not hurt my feet at all. Lousy quality control."
2.0,I would never buy this product again.
2.0,"Pants fit fine. The top is WAY too small. If you get a large bottoms, the small will fit extra small. It's just the way it comes"
2.0,"I have never worn these shorts, they run large, VERY large.  Also, the padding is very obvious.  I am past my time to return, but these shorts will be sitting in my drawers, unworn!"
2.0,"The first day I try it on, the dress broke on the back. The chest it is tight and loose on the button. The fabric is itchy. I had not opportunity of wear it for the event I wanted it."
2.0,I normally wear a large and ordered a XXL and it fits like a medium. Definitely NOT a dress. Definitely a top.
2.0,Didnt
2.0,"Very nice. I purchased several. But this blue one, for some reason, had really really long arms."
2.0,"A wallet should last at least 2 years, after only 9 months, it is ripping at almost every seam."
2.0,It looks just like the picture. It fit well. I don't like the way the band attached to the watch though. That could be improved. The black color is wearing off and I've had it for a month or so and I'm not hard on my watch. I work in an office so I'm surprised the color has worn off so quickly.
2.0,Pattern on glasses not what’s shown.
2.0,Earrings are very nice. Purchased to wear to work sling w matching bracelet and necklace but can’t wear them. I’m on the phone a lot for work and the post jams in your ear and hurts on both cell and landline. Unfortunately I only looked at them when they arrived because the necklace was great.  I didn’t attempt to wear them until after 30 days so I’m stuck w them.
2.0,I didn't like the way this dress fits me but overall it's a very cute dress.
2.0,These shorts felt more like gym shorts than golf shorts.
2.0,The threads start getting loose very quickly and this is worth it being hand wash and air dried
2.0,"Whatever they use to solder the ends breaks down quickly from sweat. After a month of wear, they just fell apart."
2.0,It doesn't seem like its sterling silver as the band has turned an odd yellowish color after I wore it in the shower. Not worth it.
2.0,"Poorly made. Sized awkwardly.  Flower coming off on corner when it arrived, and even though I am just now getting the time to review..I still haven't worn it."
2.0,They hurt my ears but they might work on other people
2.0,"Run very small and leaves indentions all over his poor legs. However, they will not fall off."
2.0,"I loved this lanyard.  Very pretty.  I got lots of compliments on it too.  I was so sad when it broke on 9/18/19, and the last day to return this item was 9/17/19.  I would love to try it again, but I think 16.99 is a bit pricey for the risk."
2.0,There just made from pieces of material. That's not even sewn on the ends.
2.0,The socks came damaged and in poor quality. One had stains right out of the package and the other was just poor quality.
2.0,"Cute, but the sound it makes is terrifying!"
2.0,"The key holder itself works just fine for what I needed it for. However, I was sent an previously-owned unit that whoever had it before me had cut the little leather loop that connects to the snap clip. Even though I am not using that actual part it is not cool to send a custom a used (and defaced) unit when being sold as 'new'. Multiple stars off for being shifty."
2.0,"I loved the product the quality is good and jems are beautiful. However i had a horrible allergic reaction to these. I believe the gold coating disqualifies them from being considered stainless steel. The gold was my favorite part of the jewelry, so sad it broke me out"
2.0,I bought this case so I could store my regular glasses in it when I ride my motorcycle and store my riding glasses in it when I'm not riding.  My regular glasses fit but my riding glasses will not.  My riding glasses are just slightly larger with a heavier frame.  The case is too small.  It's a nice case if it did what I needed.
2.0,The shirts are nice pretty thin material but way too small. I bought a package of 16-18 xxl and they look like 12-14 very disappointed
2.0,"The stones were great, size was right but the cord used in the construction was crap. There are tons of cheap beaded bracelets out there utilizing this flimsy clear cord. It’s worth it to find a reputable source that utilizes a heavy duty cord. Unfortunately this bracelet lasted less than a year. I have others, same size and price range that are 5-7 yrs old and going strong. I’ve a few other bracelets from this company that are still going maintaining. Seem to have a heavier cord. I’d like to replace this but I don’t think I will reinvest with them. Need to find a consistent quality source."
2.0,I bought this watch for gift. I’m very disappointed with the gift box.
2.0,Was tight
2.0,Material feels cheap and stiff.
2.0,"Very poor material, my daughter used it 1 time and it completely faded and was worn out."
2.0,"Watch is very beautiful, but very badly designed. The date labels don't match direction of the dials at all, and that is annoying. Also, for some reason, the date button keeps getting pressed, and have to to reset it, which requires twirling the clock hands a million times to bring the day dial through a week to make sure the date is set to the correct day for the date, and now the date function is broken, stuck between two numbers and it will not budge. Returning this thing, now!<br /><br />I wish it was better designed. I told my cousin I feel like the old man from the Dos Aquis commercials when I wore it. Oh well…"
2.0,"I am always between sizes M & L and I ordered a L this time. It’s way too big. The fabric is cheap, shiny and thick. It’s a cute design, but I don’t think I can get past the fabric."
2.0,3 months in & two are broken. Don’t bother buying unless you’re using as decoration. They feel sturdy but they just don’t last.
2.0,Much smaller than the actual size.
2.0,It smelled like fish so bad when I unpacked it I almost puked.
2.0,Pro: durable fabric CONS: I washed this apron in cold water on a short wash cycle. The black bled everywhere. I was left with a splotchy apron and a few ruined shirts.
2.0,"I bought these for my six year old daughter who has trouble with her laces during gym class.  It took me a very long time to get the elastic laces into her shoes at the proper length. After one use the elastics were coming our of her shoes at the bottom and i had to knot them at the bottom on the outside of the shoe. Sadly, I wish i had just bought her regular laces!!!!"
2.0,"Cheap, Black part faded on half of them"
2.0,The elastic wasn't big enough for a lot of the kids
2.0,"I ordered this as a gift for my niece and it is adorable, but I never gave it to her because the tag says ""Professional Dry Clean"" and I don't want my sister-in-law to hate me."
2.0,Well I guess I got what I paid for.  Had these about a month and a half.  Wore them mainly for coaching baseball and to wear driving around.  All I ever have done was change out one lens for another the day I got them and have only taken them off and put them on my head and this morning the frame cracked in half so now I have this full set of lenses and a case that are useless.  I thought it was a great deal for all that comes with the set and they promote massive flexibility I am not hard on glasses at all and they didn't live up to the hype. Glad I didn't blow money on getting the prescription insert done just yet.
2.0,"Very cheap material - would not recommend it. Go for a higher end product, it's worth the money."
2.0,"Im 5,9 so the pants were like high waters on me in addition to that the string that runs through the pants starting running and turning to shreds as I was threading the pants. The material feels like work pants too cheapy looking not what I expected will be returning."
2.0,I used for Halloween. I was a biker chick! Nice
2.0,Does not fit over my glasses.
2.0,The material is ....odd.  Feels almost spongy.  I don't recommend it.  Price caught my eye.  Quality and material make price irrelevant.  I returned it.
2.0,Very poor quality and I had a lot of trouble with them when returning the product.
2.0,It's a very pretty sweater however it is not look good on round people.  I bought a XL and stripes on it make me look much rounder.
2.0,They where to small
2.0,I washed this for the first time and the one buckle fell off so I can't return now that too much time has passed. I would say this is a cheap shirt and you get what you pay for.
2.0,"Headline when I purchased mentioned stretch material. There was no give and it runs small so I had to return. Seemed nice quality, especially for the price but it was frustrating that the description was wrong and I couldn't keep this."
2.0,"The fabric is more like plastic.  I tried to iron it and it melted, not a burn mark from the iron as you’d normally see, but the fabric actually crinkled up right before my eyes.  And that part was hard,  like plastic.  I never got to wear it.  $ down the drain."
2.0,This is a very nice bra for people with a cup size no larger than C! I was very disappointed because it seemed quite comfortable and well made. The band fit perfectly. But the fabric for the cups only came halfway up my D size breasts!
2.0,Size too large. Son unable to wear.
2.0,Very disappointed in the fit.  I even order the next size up and it still doesn't fit.
2.0,"Cheap quality, poor finish on clip and extremely thin belt. And belt doesn’t look like the one in the image."
2.0,Not at all what I expected.  The shirt is flimsy and easily loses its shape.
2.0,"This feels like a scam. Not sure pvc is a helpful material to list as this feels like a rubber or latex. Either way, it does not meet expectations. Trying to return but Amazon is claiming it’s a gas or explosive die to the pvc and is not eligible to return. We shall see…"
2.0,A hat with a sticker on it. The letters were not on straight
2.0,"Too small, my sons girlfriend is an 8, I am a 16 it didn’t fit either of<br />Us correctly"
2.0,"They fit well, and stay in which is good. The problem is the flesh color is too light, and in about a week or two it fades to white. Kinda frustrating when you're trying to make your piercing incognito. They work functionally, but are not an ideal solution to what I needed."
2.0,The lense popped out the first time I put them on.
2.0,"Intense side boob alert.  I’m 5’4, 138lbs., & a 34 DDD (at Victoria Secret (no, they never carry my size)). Purchased a Medium. It fits PERFECT from the waist down, but there’s only 1/4 of the fabric necessary to cover even a portion of my chest.  I wanted to love this suit, but it’s just not meant for a full chest unless you’re going for A LOT of boob."
2.0,nice but two sizes too small
2.0,The white stripes came off after 2nd wash which I didn’t dry it either time :/
2.0,The top around the chest on the strapless side was cut too low... and a little too loose. Also the drape part comes off a little bat cape-ish instead of glam like the picture. Might look better on a different body I think.
2.0,"Too was super cute online. Ordered the size small, it fit great at the waist but the shoulders and sleeves were awkward and made me look wide. The pattern and color was cute but I returned it. Wasn’t flattering."
2.0,"These ran way too small, but I had to make it work because there wasn't time to return them. :-("
2.0,Looks nice enough and I've received some compliments but the chain has already started to show wear/discoloration. Disappointed-I've barely had it a month.
2.0,"To tight, to short, I ordered the size I wear in everything.. normally a bit big, this was to small! I’d say at least a size smaller then listed. Not to mention a pain to return it!  Order a size bigger. I’m bummed wanted this so bad! 😕"
2.0,These pants are true to size bordering to running big. I bought the &#34;black&#34; with pink flowers and it's not a true black. More like a weird dark gray. The material is somewhat soft but cheap. They are very long and sewn very poorly. There is a thread loose and the elastic is extremely poor.  The top gray part is just loose fabric with a thin elastic piece thrown in the top.  See photo.
2.0,It’s kind of boxy and not a great shape at the top. Not a fan of the fabric and how it sits
2.0,The arms fit too tight for the rest of the dress. The fabric was very cheap as well. I expected better for such a cute style!
2.0,Not a great buy the fit is off
2.0,Not as vibrant as pictured. Kinda big. Just ehhhhh....
2.0,"This is way too small, I was disappointed because the fabric was soft & loved the pattern.  Didn't want to bother with ordering different sizes to fit, so just returned & got my money back."
2.0,The quality is lot what I hoped for and the writing rubbed off in a few days. I still use it though and it just looks really worn.
2.0,Not what I was expecting - to small and poor quality
2.0,"This faded after having it about 2 weeks, it’s beautiful the color just fades"
2.0,I was expecting better quality and more soft bracelet.
2.0,"It's soft, but runs small. It's short, not long enough to stay in place."
2.0,Size is way off and material for all 3 shirts are different. I was very unhappy with my purchase
2.0,"Not sure how I feel about this. First saw it in the bag I thought this is going back, not a jacket at all but more like a soft sweater but not quality one. The material inside (lining) is net like. The collar seems a bit deformed. Thinking if I should return. If I decide to keep it would only be because of it having a crop fit."
2.0,"Purchased based on title description &#34;Sterling Silver&#34;. This is NOT silver; sterling or otherwise. For one thing, it is a requirement that sterling be stamped with &#34;.925&#34;. No such stamp exists on this piece or the chain. It is thin, lightweight, silver-TONE metal. I have an armoire filled with sterling. The price of this piece was a tip-off. This design in sterling would have cost considerably more. I paid twice too much for this, but I intend to keep it as the front of the medallion makes a good presentation (even if the back speaks of &#34;cheaply made&#34;), and I wanted a Flower of Life pendant.<br /><br />Posting this review so that anyone else who desires a purchase of this pendant with chain will KNOW that it is NOT &#34;sterling silver&#34;. Whatever happened to &#34;truth in advertising&#34;? Not seeing any of that in this item description!"
2.0,"Very cheap, thin material. Sizing is not true to American standards-Sweater has an odor to it. Threads are hanging-very poor quality. Disappointed."
2.0,"The hat would fit a child or small woman. It's very, very small thought well made with good quality fabric."
2.0,"Very poorly made. The seams that were ironed did not match up with the seams that were sewn, and the sewing was frequently veering off the seams. The straps were not finished, just the raw edge of the fabric with about two stitches across it. Seems like a good deal with a 4 star item for a low price but buyer beware, it's not worth it."
2.0,looks  cheap
2.0,Material is not very soft.  Not too bad for the price
2.0,"Very cute but the chains tangle up so bad that it makes it impossible to wear. It seems like only minutes after putting this necklace on, the chains get all tangled up, which creates a very disorderly appearance."
2.0,The dress is cute but mine had no belt and looked silly with no belt. Yes it's a thin dress but it's $27 what do we expect. It def needs a belt. I did feel like Minnie Mouse in it tho. A little long also.
2.0,Absolutely does not fit well. Minimal stretch in the fabric. I had to sew the top to fit properly and I'm only a B so it's not like I have huge boobs.<br />Wouldn't buy again.
2.0,"Received it quickly, but the sizing is off. I ordered the XXL and it fits like a large. Super bummed because it is a cute shirt."
2.0,It did not fit my son who wears a 18/20. It was almost small enough to fit my son who wears a 10/12.
2.0,"Bad finger cover, poor quality, broken thread at the joint! Not recommended!"
2.0,"My Granddaughter is returning this (before we even got it).  She didn't read the reviews and realized it might not be a good product for her.  We didn't even take it out of the package, so we can't answer the ""fit"" questions."
2.0,My Husband bought me these earrings & I LOVED them...Sadly I have had them only since Christmas and 5 crystals have already fell out of one earring. I am really bummed because they are beautiful and I got a lot of compliments on them but they did not hold up. Needless to say my Husband is not happy that I have had them less than 2 months and they are already ruined. :(
2.0,Not recommended for bustier women. 38DDD
2.0,"After wearing it for a couple of hours, the stitching started to come apart. Not good quality."
2.0,"The shoe is not made of leather, and I found the 12 m  fit too snuggly.  Sent it back and was once again very impressed with Amazon's return plicy"
2.0,The elastic falls apart quite easily.  Not made with durable materials.  Love the magnetic effects though
2.0,"The quality of the hat is cheap, wasn’t presentable, and ripped easily. Will have to throw it out. Rest of items were ok."
2.0,The coat was very small and came with rips in the lining.  It was beautiful and soft but not very sturdy.  The company was excellent in the return process but I won't order another one.
2.0,"I have never worn this item (although despite other reviews, it came in great condition with no threads hanging out or any type of damage), because it is ""puffy"". It is difficult to describe, but I can't imagine it looking flattering on many people."
2.0,"Maybe its the fact i weight lift, but the sleeves are so tight and the shirt just sits funny on me."
2.0,"It's cute tote with a zipper. But I think could find better for same price at Ross, TJ Max, Target, JC penny, etc. But it's convenient to shop from comfort of home."
2.0,Earrings  are so small
2.0,Very cute in person. Very sleek and feminine  looking. It seems like most of the Blaze bands are wide and masculine or just not very dressy. This changes that without having to get a chain link band. Stains easily though. I have a wine colored winter jacket that I guess rubbed off on it. It’s never done that on anything Else before. So now there is this pink stain going down the center of the band.<br />Also the band seems a little flimsy. So I have to be self aware whenever I’m strapping it on. It seems like if you’re doing it in a hurry and too rough you could rip or tear something pretty easily.<br /><br />Update: changing from 4 starts to 2. this band material is not durable. The band itself won’t break from the watch frame. But the material (the reason why you bought it) has faded. It is tearing off. Pink never came off. does not look cute anymore. Will be buying a new one from somewhere<br />else. Pictures included. Disappointed. It’s only been a few months
2.0,I bought 2 for my nieces and they fit really wired  the under part was cut slim but it was to large so her little busines was showing and the top part was large. I'm somewhat disappointed.
2.0,"This is a long sleeve t-shirt, not a tunic. It is much shorter than shown on the model, and I sized up in the hopes of it being loose. That was a dream, because this is snug. It does come to the waist, but does not cover any of the booty like what is shown on the model. I'm on the fence about keeping it, but wanted to warn others to not expect to get what you see in the picture. It wasn't expensive, but I would for once like to see these overseas sellers provide what is shown. 😞"
2.0,"We bought it November 2, 2012 and it broke apart in March. I must say we used it every day for work, but I thought it would last longer."
2.0,"Super cheap costume glasses, fit very small."
2.0,pretty but very flimsy and the pieces don' lay all that smoothly. but it is pretty.
2.0,"If you are tall and skinny this may be super cute. I am 5'7"" and average size with a c/d cup.  The top to this came and the cups and pads were under my armpits. I removed those and the top is actually kind of cute. The bottoms are expected, but the style look terrible on me and looked like a diaper.  I would not buy this again based on that."
2.0,Looks black as my heart after receiving it.
2.0,Plastic feeling not enough pockets inside the bag. Better suited for a kid who doesn’t need various compartments for personal items
2.0,"This top is sized incredibly small. I ordered a 3xl, 3 times my usual size and I couldn't get it on."
2.0,Everything about the shirt looks like the picture except the button on the neck area. Mine has no button.
2.0,"The neck fit too tight, but the shirt was OK"
2.0,Everything was great until washing it. Shrunk at least 2 sizes and isn't worn anymore.
2.0,"I bought the size that corresponded with my sons shoe size. When I installed them, it was difficult to make them stretch all the way to the top. When they finally did, it made the shoe super tight to get on. I had to undo one circle each time to get the shoes on. I wanted something that didn't untie but also something my son could put on by himself. This doesn't quite work. Perhaps order a size up. I feel like the ones that connect on each level and not as a whole may work better."
2.0,"Feels like a size and a half too small in the mid section, the hood is a good size, the screen printing looks good, but its not exactly what I was expecting. Also, the zipper broke within 5 minutes. Mark it 8 Dude."
2.0,"Nice concept, but the sizing is terribly small. I ordered a 9, and they’re too small to even wear on my size 7 finger. I think maybe I could wear them on my pinky, which is like a 5.5 or 6. I don’t see how these would fit any adult, but maybe great for older children??"
2.0,not as form fitting as it looks online
2.0,Item looks good feel nice just 3x means like size 5
2.0,Cute bag but it it not insulated. Just a bag.
2.0,"the material. picture looked like a good grade of denium, but was very light material"
2.0,"This was a poor-quality dress. Threads and runs everywhere, not true to size, sooo small. I returned it."
2.0,very weird cut and super thin
2.0,The turquoise stone was boring...all blue with one line across the middle...not much character. The silver setting was nicely done. Very disappointed.
2.0,I didn't like the fabric.
2.0,"Now, I ordered two blouses from AINCRSO and they both have the same style, but this one in particular is made out of a jersey type material. Very cheap looking in  reality and the colors are jet black, with very bribrant colors.<br />Going back, I don't like it."
2.0,"Blouse was not as described on the website. Not a flattering design, but beautiful style. Disappointing..."
2.0,"I like the watch. It has a really nice feel to it. However, after having for a week and a half the battery died. It no longer works."
2.0,I got the small. At 5’4” 119 lbs it was still a bit big. It goes out wide to hips and comes back to tight at feet. Mermaid style. You have to take small steps. I personally did not like the style or fit. I returned it.
2.0,"It is much Narrower (1"" wide) and Shorter than it is displayed in the misleading display picture. Fits like a Choker...see Display Picture attached.  Very Disappointed."
2.0,"Bought these for my diabetic husband who is having a really hard time with blisters on his feet. Not only are they not safety toe, he said they were very hard, uncomfortable, and absolutely no padding. His feet hurt more wearing these then when he wore cheap steel toe boots from Walmart."
2.0,"The color was more on the rust or burnt side, other than red. The shoulders were too tight. I’m giving it away as a gift."
2.0,"Incorrect color, it’s kind of bronze, or copper"
2.0,"Purchased for a costume party, it was very hard to straighten the wig. It was back frizzy within a couple of hours."
2.0,"But even with light use the clip broke, cheap junk. I was standing on a bridge when this occurred, but fortunately, some of the keys were stuck in my pocket so they did not fall into the drink."
2.0,They work good for a couple of weeks but after they just didn't work water goes in the gloves maybe just got a bad pair
2.0,"I ordered two Jessica Howard dresses and both seemed cheap. This one Was cut poorly and the fabric wasn’t impressive. Ordered a different style from another retailer and it was great. I am not sure Amazon is selling authentic Jessica Howard.  Granted it is a bargain brand, but has always been a great go to when you need several dresses per season and don’t wish to spend a fortune."
2.0,"Purse was great but can’t really say NFL approved , was made to throw it in the trash at Gillette stadium in Foxboro Mass where they insisted that it didn’t meet criteria"
2.0,not worth it and much cheaper at store
2.0,"I thought this dress looked so cute in the pictures, but upon trying it on I cannot tell if the pieces of the dress that tie together are poorly cut or if it’s the pattern. Unfortunately, this one has to go back."
2.0,"I bought a black and a white one in my normal size (M), they're so large I could wear them as a dress"
2.0,"The dress was really pretty but after wearing it for a hour, both of the armpits starting to get these string things (see in picture)."
2.0,"Don’t like, run small."
2.0,watch case is too small for my wrist! I purchased this watch and the Sturhling watch and kept the Sturhling and returned the Burei.
2.0,Just taking them out of the bag they obviously look much less like the picture than I'd have hoped.. they seem very shapeless and boxy. Not like the normal high waist shape.. The material is not thick denim as pictured. It's thin and stretchy.. not very pleased at all
2.0,Was not explained as a 2 piece set
2.0,Material is not comfortable at all. You get what you pay for
2.0,Ordered in size 6 as all my other rings but this ring is too small. Paid for next day air came 2 days later. Wsh it fit because it really is beautiful.
2.0,This shirt was a disappointment sizing wise
2.0,Returned crappy like a curtain
2.0,"Great bag, yet it didn't have an interior pocket that fit my iPhone 6S Plus. Other than that, it is a great tote."
2.0,"Actually there is nothing I like about this shirt. I'm not crazy about the fabric, I don't like the cut, it runs VERY large and it hangs horribly."
2.0,This is not as warm as it looks in the photo. I sent it back.
2.0,The closure of it
2.0,I ordered a XL and it was extremely big around the waist & the jacket was too big.. So you’ll have to order a size down! I want purchase from the vendor again!
2.0,"This is not great for use as a covid facemask for hot summer days. I bought this originally because I wanted to find a breathable face mask, post apocalypse/covid-19. This was not it. It is hot, hard to breathe in, and made me really sweaty. I don't recommend if you're looking for a summer covid-mask."
2.0,"While these are listed to fit a size nine, I wear an eight and they are too short in the foot. Thus, the curve of the heel is in the wrong place. The fabric is a bit coarse, but sufficiently thick and warm."
2.0,It was to big on me
2.0,"Used it for a few times and threw it away. Bad quality, falling off the skin"
2.0,Sooooo thin. Spend a few extra dollars and buy a better and thicker pain
2.0,Not really what I was looking for. I thought it was a &#34;wallet&#34; but is just two pieces of material with a band. My husband wasn't thrilled. Will be looking for something else!
2.0,It looks nothing like the photo and the material is weird. Way too big.
2.0,Not even 6 months and it's no longer usable
2.0,Not happy with fabric and how it drapes.  Had to iron shirt and it still looks wrinkled!  Not worth the effort to return.
2.0,Very cute but the wire the beads are on is stiff making it a bit tight while it's on. Maybe better for smaller wrists. Beads could be better looking but from a distance it's hard to notice the poor quality.
2.0,Its okay but I think I only feel this way because it didn't fit my ankle :...&#62;(
2.0,"Nice fabric. Great style for a cover wrap. Wanted to love it, but definitely NOT one size fits all. More like 'one size fits some'.  I wear sizes 8-10, and this wrap didn't cover much. Too short on fabric. Could have used an extra 1 to 2 feet to go around and cover like the model shown.  She is probably no more than a size 2, so buyers keep that in mind. Nice product but needs improvement, or just more sizes."
2.0,"The dress was flimsy and did not flare like I had hoped.  I thought that the length would have been longer, too"
2.0,"This dress seems to be made nicely, can probably be reversible as well, but it just didn't work for me. I found the bodice to be strange - if I had really huge boobs and they were under my armpits, it probably would have fit."
2.0,Most of the rings were much bigger than I expected. I think only one or maybe two fit me. They are really cute though. I suppose you could probably get those ring spaces to get them to fit.
2.0,They're ok... Not the same color shown.
2.0,Not as oversized as i expected. I wanted bigger lens
2.0,Like the socks only had two pair had holes in them before I even got to wear them
2.0,"Okay listen so it’s not the best okay, if you want a fake one don’t get the magnetic one. The magnet is really weak and not sturdy.it is also not so comfortable. I wanted to like it but just not it ya know ☹️"
2.0,"LOVE this shirt other than the fact that it is too small, including the sleeves. They are too tight around my arms & I don't even have fat arms."
2.0,"I wear A-LOT of jumpsuits, they are easy to wear can be dressed up or down and are staples in my wardrobe year round. This jumpsuit was extremely unflattering on me as I am heavy at the bottom with curves. I probably will not wear this out."
2.0,Cute for the price but very hard to change the links. Comes with cheap tools that break easily.
2.0,"Wore in colder dry temps and the tips of my fingers were freezing. Also, the tips of the fingers are long making it difficult to use fingers when wearing. Returned."
2.0,Looks great in the picture but it's really hard to read and reflects really bad. Nice watch but hard to see past the glass. Also the winder knob is so lose it changes the time and date
2.0,"Purchased a SpotAlen watch... see Amazon add<br />Clearly reads  ""SpotAlen"" on watch Face<br /><br />""Binzi Watch""  was sent.... see picture<br /><br />Unlike the photo the Face is difficult to see..<br />Black Face is really dark... cannot make out Hands.<br /><br />Unfortunately I am Returning...."
2.0,"This is a fine dress for lounging or if you are pregnant; otherwise, not flattering, I don't care what your shape/size is!"
2.0,Not what I was expecting. It's very stiff with what looks like a plastic costing of paint. Looks cheap but I should have known for the price!
2.0,Very cheaply made. Very thin
2.0,Love the designs but not waterproof
2.0,Not small and feels cheap.
2.0,"Paint is not covering every place it should, such as the silver for the vertical tubes and looks to be peeling off before first use. Visible glue just painted over. Looks very messy. all layers of the mask are not even and therefore some sticks out more than others. Disappointing product."
2.0,"I really like the look of this bag, and I bought leather so that it would last. After moderate use, it is now breaking down at the point where the handles attach to the body. The wear has revealed that the material is pressed leather (small pieces glued together) rather than genuine leather (a continuous piece). I'm disappointed, and now I need to buy a new bag. :("
2.0,"I used this for a shoulder cover up. Too small, I should have ordered the nxt size up, maybe 2 sizes."
2.0,Didn't last long it broke after a month of use
2.0,Color too faded... Not impressed. Looking for red not faded red.
2.0,The watch was not working. The battery was dead. I had to return it. It did look exactly as described.
2.0,I returned this item. The photo made it look to be pink and grey (what I was looking for) and it is peach/coral and rust/brown in actuality. I'm giving it two stars because it is a good quality and generous size but not the color shown in the photo.
2.0,"It was cute while I still super excited about a deathly hollows, until I really looked at it and noticed how low quality it was. For the price  I guess it was ok."
2.0,"It was great at the start, but only a month in it broke. I was disappointed because I loved this belly ring. Really wish it would have lasted longer."
2.0,I didn't like that is was pretty thin and doesn't have pockets
2.0,"The pin is not made very well.  The silver veins do not show up at all, and the broach is flat.  It is, however, a rich dark green.  I would not recommend this if you are a true Tolkien fan.  If you would just like to put this accessory in a display case, it MIGHT work."
2.0,"The photo of the model makes this look like a thick knit beanie, when it reality, it's actually super thin. You can see what I mean by comparing the cuff on my photo to the cuff on the listing. Super disappointed. Love the color though, so that's the only reason it's getting any stars. But, I will be returning this."
2.0,The coat is made out of nice material and all but the cut of the jacket leaves a lot to be desired. I’m 5’8 135lb and ordered the small. It was incredibly boxy looking and overall not flattering. The length wasn’t bad though.
2.0,I'm a woman and I have a smaller face. These are huge for reading glasses. There's no looking over them. And they're quite heavy.
2.0,"I liked this hoop but also didn't like it. They took forever to get here but didn't complain because of the price, they kept falling out of my nose while I slept so I'd wake up and low and behold no nose ring in. I liked it because I'm very sensitive to what piercings I use and this didn't irritate me"
2.0,The material was cheaply made
2.0,"bro the chain is terrible , the plack is the only nice thing"
2.0,A little disproportionate top to bottom. I’m a 2.... maybe a 4 and the bottom was just too snug. Bummer.
2.0,looks nice.  But the buckle broke prematurely.
2.0,"It's a very pretty anklet, but I wore it for 3 hours and then it broke. I couldn't fix it and it was really disappointing. It was pretty while it lasted."
2.0,"I loved the fit of the gloves, how they looked, and how they kept my hands nice and warm.  However, after only a month, the one strap has come off, leaving a hole, and the seams around the top of the index finger have come apart and have left another hole and the &#34;texting material&#34; hanging off of the finger.  I went from super happy to super disappointed."
2.0,Do not waste your money on this. Extremely lightweight - would it keep the heat off the head?? Very large and if you tighten it you end up with a big ugly lump hitting your head. No labels. Came folded and the folds will always be there.
2.0,"It's cute, decent quality."
2.0,"Cute shoe, my two year old can get them on and off. The only issue I have is it has a terrible smell, like the fabric just stinks and I’ve washed them almost ten times and the smell won’t go away. Needless to say the stay outside and will only be worn outdoors."
2.0,"The watch looks cool but did not work well for me, required to be reset daily even if worn 12 hours a day, supposedly these watches after wearing are supposed to run 48 hours without need to rewear them, but I did not find that to work for me. Also has a very difficult trifold clasp, that I had to cut off and buy a replacement band. All in a shiny hunk of junk."
2.0,mal acabado
2.0,"The shirt does fit a bit too small, as noted in the description. I ordered a size up and it fit about right. The material is soft and comfortable, however it's not very true to the pictures depicted. I ordered the shirt because I wanted really deep cut sleeves to show off a tattoo I have there, and any length in the vicinity of my elbow would have been great. My guess is the model for the shirt is very very short. I'm 5'6&#34; and the arm holes are only a tiny bit larger than normal shirts. I purchased a large. Previous reviewer noted that the back cut was more shallow than depicted and that is accurate for my experience too. I returned the item because it wasn't what I was wanting. It was still a nice enough shirt, so long as you're not wanting really deep arms. Perhaps the lister could notate the measurements for future prospective purchasers."
2.0,Rather cheap looking.
2.0,Wrong size sent. I returned it.
2.0,For the price... great shirt... just not true to size.. Gave it away.
2.0,May have been sized wrong.  Have bought this shoe before and fit find.  This pair was overly large.  if I order again will try a size smaller.
2.0,"Its cute, but feels like a child's toy. It doesn't feel as soft as my others. It feels exactly like a troll's doll hair."
2.0,Maybe is for very small people that don't need it?  Uncomfortable to wear
2.0,"Very low quality item. Cheap, flimsy and broke very quickly. I gave 2 stars since the customer service and response time from Wellme was impressive."
2.0,backpack was a good size.  but didn't even last a full school year.  already has a hole in it.
2.0,Looks cheap and did not fit well
2.0,"First impression they are eggshell white, NOT white (in fact the fabric connected to the zippers IS white; therefore. next to the legging material, it has a has a yellow tinge).<br /><br />I'm 5'8, 140 lbs with an athletic (I ride and work with horses) build. They were very tight around the ankles and loose around the waist.<br /><br />They don't breathe."
2.0,"This skirt is extremely thin and small. An xl fits like a small. It's very pretty, but I won't be wearing it."
2.0,Poor cloth quality
2.0,"Too small, weird trim but pretty material."
2.0,It’s very cute and it is comfortable. However it doesn’t actually lock into place and slides out of place causing the watch to fall off frequently.
2.0,Super cute except it got twisted within a few days
2.0,Cute sweater but it does not fit oversized … i am 5'3 and wear between small and medium … it hit me right at the waist hip area …didn't look terrible but definitely is not a one size fits item… item has been returned
2.0,Shoulders too big and stomach area is like 3 sizes smaller
2.0,This is a iron on sticker and it's very low quality this is not a song web type thing
2.0,"It looked better in the pic then it does in person. It also fits tighter. I ordered a size larger then what i wear. Overall, disappointed"
2.0,"I got these sunglasses, loved them, wore them for one day.  I stuck them in my purse with nothing in it but my wallet cellphone and a book, and one of the eye lenses popped out.  Not very well made at all."
2.0,"I liked the shape and length of the necklace, but the item was received completely tangled and the largest stone had fallen out. It did not even seem to fit into the setting for it, so I couldn't even try to glue it back in place. Therefore, I had to return it. The &#34;stones&#34; were definitely cheap (as expected), but probably ok for younger girls...if they're in their proper settings upon arrival."
2.0,"Poor quality , runs VERY small slits on side are to high so you have to have something on under it , color was fine not as bright as the picture ."
2.0,Too long. Design prevented me from tightening on most of them. The packaging was pretty and well put together.
2.0,I wear a size 8 in US Women's shoes. These socks don't even cover the heal of my foot with the pad made to cover it. Just another ripoff from China... Where they have small feet. Socks are soft tho. I'm sure when I wash them I'll be lucky to wear them.
2.0,Does not look nothing like picturd
2.0,Poorly made I was disappointed because it was a gift for my friend. Strings were coming out and th stitching wasn’t straight
2.0,These earrings are way too small.  Too hard for my fingers to maneuver.
2.0,Smaller fit that the other colors. And it's not jeans material is white cloth that is painted grey
2.0,Shoes were great at first but shoes did not last 2 weeks before sole came undone.
2.0,"Not a fan of these. They “work”/serve their purpose, but I would not/have not regularly used them for athletic wear “everyday” shorts.<br /><br />+ Well-made and sturdy/durable.<br />+ The sizing is quite accurate and I was able to select the size that fit me per the chart. (I’ve seen several shorts that the sizing chart is off how it fits.)<br /><br />+/- These are a “quick dry,” but mostly after you wash them. I never became so sweaty that these ever wicked up the sweat and then dried timely. They only seem to *relatively* dry quickly when hung-dried.<br />+/- Colour/colour option is a bit bland.<br />+/- They feel more like board shorts (only without the mesh inner lining.) If that is your cup of tea, then these are for you, but not for me.<br />+/- Pockets “work” to hold/carry, but they aren’t always user-friendly to slip your hand into to store your phone/keys/misc pocket item. (It’s been a minute since I last used this pair - NOT my first go-to pair - and I vaguely recall an item falling out/slipping out at times, but not consistently.)<br /><br />- These are almost too lightweight. I have experimented with several other shorts that are supposed to be “quick dry”/“quick dry”-like.<br /><br />…there really isn’t much to write about this. I wouldn’t reave about them and these would not be my first recommendation.<br />One could probably use them over leggings or compression pants (I’ve tried both,) but are not the best stand-alone shorts, even for the warmer weathers of spring and summer."
2.0,"Too long for me, but decent material, nice look, and easy to use."
2.0,Looks lovely but it doesn't keep time
2.0,Poor quality material cheap.<br />Runs small
2.0,"I’m 5’5, 138 pounds, and usually around a size 6. I ordered the medium and fit is pretty decent. However, I am not too impressed with the material’s quality. The construction is good enough, but the material is rather thin, very static-y, and clings to the body in an extremely unflattering way. I don’t have too much of a tummy, but it clung on the entirety of what I do have, and clung on to my crotch as well. In addition to this, the fabric just feels kind of weird and cheap to the touch as well. I’m pretty disappointed in this skirt and will probably see if I can return it as I doubt I’d ever choose to wear it."
2.0,Too small. And I have a small face.
2.0,"I was super excited at the price point of these and assumed I was just finding a flash deal or something, but when I got the dresses in (ordered 2; black & “red”) I realized why they were priced the way they were. The seams are curvy, it’s sewn totally off. But the weirdest part is that the first tier is super long. It should be about 1-2 inches shorter, so the dress isn’t a-line. It’s straight through the torso, then the bottom two tiers are a-line. Very odd fit. And fyi, the “red” color looks coral online, is called red, and in person is jack-o-lantern orange."
2.0,"I expected a narrow fit, was way too big and I ordered the slim."
2.0,"I bought this one because I had to go trough some radiatin on my heads and wanted to cover my face. I borrowed one from my friend before I buy this one. The shade was movable, but this one the shade is staying in one place. The headband is pushing on both side.<br />The red color was as vibrant as the picture<br />I didn't return it because I payed for shipping and should have payed for return shipping. Which made it pointless."
2.0,"I like the material but without the belt, the look is not complete."
2.0,"Are you sure this product passed the UV-A radiation blockage test? If so, give me the detailed information about the following:<br /><br />the name of the institution that conducted the test;<br />how well the visor block UA-A radition (e.g., 50+ UPF)<br />the copy of the certificate or proof that the product passed the test<br /><br />I ask this question because this product seems to be the cheap one being sold in Korea. And it seems that some Koreans are involved in selling this visor.<br /><br />FYI, in Korea stuff like this product sells at $1~5."
2.0,"Thoughts:<br />Wanted so badly to like this swimsuit/skirt. Machine wash cold like colors, line dry or tumble dry low. Completely covered my derriere, but I have long torso, so the top of swimsuit barely covered what it should've across my chest. This was supposed to be XL, really it was just medium sized. Not US human woman size, in my opinion. The material is thick, soft, and nice stitching, concealing tummy area. Just came in 2 to 3 sizes too small.<br /><br />Details:<br />85% polyester 15% spandex. Pull On closure. V neck swimsuits, tank top design, with wide shoulder straps, offer plenty coverage on shoulder, modest swimwear for women. Soft removable pads and wire free, bust hem with elastic band, provide the shape and support for the bust; swimming dress for ladies. Slimming one piece swimsuit with insert brief, perfect all in one bathing suits; front lining with comfortable fabric one piece swimdress. Skirted bathing suits, high waisted design, flowy skirt offers roomly on belly, conceal tummy perfectly; flattering one piece swimsuits. Scoop back bathing suits. Garment Care hand wash in cold water/or on delicates cold lay flat to dry."
2.0,Heating on top of foot only :(
2.0,Cute set!  Shirt is too short.  It falls right above hips...needs to be lengthened.
2.0,"The lenses don’t fit properly. There is a small space between the lens and the frame. Very disappointing. And even worse, I reached out to their support to see if I could get an exchange but have heard nothing back from them. Steer clear!!<br /><br />UPDATE: Changing to two stars since customer service did respond, albeit 8 days later."
2.0,The photo looked great but the quality of the fabric caused the dress hang like a sack.
2.0,"Disappointed with this one -- I had hoped for a sturdy bag like previous Dakine purchases. After minimal use, the stitching has come apart, and the strap is falling off. I probably won't be buying Dakine again."
2.0,Runs very small.  See through fabric.
2.0,They don't work so well.
2.0,The earrings are thin and the color is grayish. I thought the earrings was a pretty color .
2.0,"We thought they would help with night driving as some of the ads have said, but they don't.  Just feel like it was a waste of money and too much of a hassle to send them back.  Do not recommend."
2.0,"My biggest gripe with these readers is that they keep falling off my nose. I had a pair of the Thin Optics that worked well, but they are fragile and eventually broke. I was hoping these would be a more robust replacement, but it is a poor design."
2.0,"The sizing chart claimed that the XL would fit up to a size 18, which my daughter is, but once she had it on, there was no way possible to zip it up. It was literally about 2-3 sizes too small.<br /><br />Otherwise it was a cute dress for the price. We donated it to someone who could use it."
2.0,"Seemed like they'd work great, very comfortable, but after a week of chopping wood two fingers already have holes in them. Probably best for lighter duty work. They don't work a darn with my touchscreen."
2.0,"The Kenneth Cole mask is soft and looks nice.  However, the masks are are only in one size -- and they are too small to fit properly (on my face or my wife's).  Also, even though the 6-layer mask provides good protection, breathing is far too difficult than it should be.  If I could return them, I would.  Pity."
2.0,sleeves are more 3/4 length than slouchy like on the model.
2.0,Had them for 2 months before the polarized film started to seperate
2.0,Not like the picture at all. Very cheaply made and it’s see through
2.0,Item was too big for my arm.
2.0,The quality es ver y good but it es not the same un the picture.
2.0,"This came with a cut in 2 places!<br />I can sew, I would fix it rather than send it back, I just put a seams in it. Will wear it around the house!!!!"
2.0,The leg of the boxers were to small.
2.0,**DID ANYONE ELSE EXPERIENCE THIS! It won't zip all the way down to get off and on. I have to step into it. The 1 zipper goes up at the bottom and the 2nd goes down at the top but because they meet in the middle you cannot completely unzip jacket. Otherwise I love it... fits well..fashionable..beautiful fur. Looks like the picture.. but this zipper has me really disappointed
2.0,"Pros: Beautiful.  Perfect for dressy events.  Magnetic latch that stays closed.<br />Cons:  and this is the deal breaker...the opening to the bag is SO SMALL that there's no way I could put anything in and have any hope of finding it, much less being able to reach it.  :-("
2.0,These were so cute and a bit big but the bows fell off 2 pairs and they weren’t even worn.
2.0,"Well they're cute, no doubt about that. But they are super bent. Clearly that's not due to shipping, considering they came in a cardboard box, but cmon dude. They sit lopsided on my face. I have tried to bend them back myself but they just keep going back to their misshaped frame. I am le disappoint."
2.0,"Very cute design, but way way bigger than it looks in the picture. I am a size 4 and 5'5&#34; and it was enormous on me. The elastic was pointless because it didn't even touch my body. The front and back looked very odd because of the drooping fabric and elastic.<br /><br />The material is also VERY cheap which of course should be expected for the price, but just a warning.<br /><br />This might be cute on a much larger person, but if you are smaller than probably a size 10, I wouldn't bother with it. Needless to say, I'll be trying something else."
2.0,"Attached a small key, but it wouldn't float."
2.0,This broke almost immediately (maybe on my third or fourth wear). It's very cute once on but it's impossibly cheap. Buy at least three if you're gonna buy any.
2.0,"These earphones are stunning. Unfortunately, one of the earrings was loose, so it was bound to fall off. Thus, I returned it before I could loose it. :/"
2.0,"The vessel inside the heart is so tiny that I could barely get any ashes in there. Also, the paper funnel that comes with it is so narrow at the end that no ashes will go through it. I ended up snipping it off at the tip to compensate.  Also, this is not engraved as they would have you believe, but instead laserprinted on the surface. So don't wear it while you're sweating, or else the lettering will rub right off.  In addition, the lettering isn't centered all that well on the back from top to bottom. I'm keeping it because some of my loved one's dust is already in there, but overall I'm rather disappointed with it."
2.0,It did not look like the picture. It's cheap and old (faded) looking.
2.0,"Not sure if this is actually 8 inches - it's quite loose on my wrist. Wish the fit was better, would've been satisfied with quality at the price."
2.0,"Very cute design, but you can see every love handle and fat you have. I’d go a size larger. Maybe that would help hide all that?!"
2.0,They’re too tight for my toddler’s feet.
2.0,Bought for my 7 year old son. He loves them. He’s says they are very warm and comfy. Already ripping after about two weeks. He doesn’t wear them every day either.
2.0,Product is thin which is good for hot summers. I’m 5’3” and the dress is long. You would need to wear it with high wedges or heels so you don’t trip over the dress. Main reason dress was returned is because it looks like a big tent when you put it on.
2.0,"I purchased these gloves last year, at first, I loved them, looked cool and luxurious, but they didn't keep my hands warm at all, even in the temperature of 40-50 F. Also, the quality is crap. They didn't even last me more than one winter season, I had to threw them away whenever it became warm enough not to wear them anymore."
2.0,"I like everything about this bag except that because of where the strap connects, it flips over and spill everything a lot. I guess it’s my fault for not zipping it but sometimes I forget and if I do it will probably spill everything. I would not buy again and would return if I could."
2.0,"Way cuter on the model than in real life. It went down to my knees and the middle hem was at my hips, not in the middle of my torso like shown here. It looked really silly."
2.0,"The belt we received did not look like the belt we ordered. Also, the description said the belt was 1.25 inches wide which was why it was ordered for the particular pair of pants it was to go with.  It was wider than that and would not fit through the belt loops.  The color was also off and ran more to an odd mustard than the khaki color that was listed.  The belt was returned to Amazon, and another ordered for only slight more money that is great."
2.0,Not great as it was strecthy
2.0,"Item was not loose fitting, has a smaller collar and the color was VERY dark unlike the sellers picture shown. I would almost say a different jacket completely. however it is soft and I will wear it, but buyer beware. The item in the sellers picture is not what you are going to receive. Item runs small."
2.0,The end of the strap starts to unravel<br />Making it hard to use strap bands
2.0,the material is really stiff even afterr a good wash. the arms are pretty tight and the kneck line is not the most comfortble. its cute for a picture but not really fitted for a daily wear. (also the materrial has no stretch so it clings in all the wrong place)
2.0,"Unfortunately the color is not what was shown in the picture, I ordered green stripes and what I received was blue stripes."
2.0,"Poor quality, very thin. I have old socks that are thicker than these gloves. I foresee no protection outdoors as the knit is open. Maybe indoor wear for someone with chronically cold hands, but that’s about it. I bought these with the intent to keep them in my car and give them to the people begging at the stoplights, but I don’t think it would help them much."
2.0,The suit fits well the piece of the side of the legs is just too big...the stick out from the body!
2.0,It came with a dead battery. I needed it for work so I ate the 5 bucks for a new battery and replaced.
2.0,"The sleeves are blue and the product is not very well made. Some of the stitching is coming apart, the draw string from the hoodie is coming apart at the tips and this is all straight out of the bag. And It's not very appealing. My sister asked if I made the sweater myself. It does fit as expected though."
2.0,Flag looks great when new but only lasts a few months before becoming extremely faded and frayed. Now hangs in my garage on the wall.
2.0,"This was a no from me, dawg. Didn’t look flattering at all and I felt so strange in it. It stretches, but not in a way that’s comfortable or kind lol. Sadly had to return. :( Which is a shame, because I liked the color a lot."
2.0,I thought I was ordering a dress and what I got was a shirt...it’s still cute but not what I ordered 😒
2.0,It's serviceable I suppose but it just isn't right for a wedding ring. It needs to be more silver looking.
2.0,I have ordered green and received something remotely resembling pale green. Not even close to the color shown in the pictures.
2.0,I can't wear them long. There is a hinge (for decorative purposes) right on the inside bridge of the nose that make a painful indention in your skin when you wear them.
2.0,It’s just isn’t a flattering shirt - especially with the stripes going horizontally across your stomach area. It fit fine but it wasn’t what I expected.
2.0,I bought these goggles because of the good value. They are really beautiful and comfortable but all three leak. My daughter tried each pair and each one leaks. Sadly returning these....
2.0,"I loved it, for the first month.<br />After few times in the Laundry it shrunk :( and I didn’t even dry in the dryer, just hanging to dry.<br />Now it’s just looking strange.  Also the quality is not as good...<br /><br />Disappointed.<br /><br />Too bad, it looked great when I got it."
2.0,To small but is nice dress
2.0,"This top has 2 straps like a cami and then has the piece that goes across the chest.  The fabric is cheap and the fit is very odd.  I am 5’6”, 135 and have a very small chest.  The medium “fit”, but definitely size up if you have a bigger chest.  I am disappointed overall and am sending this back ASAP."
2.0,More like a maternity style
2.0,[[VIDEOID:db447356e17b783b2e02b7dda761d6f6]] It’s cute just not as good of quality as I would have preferred. It’s flat and dull. I got a 2x so I didn’t want it big or too puffy. But it’s really flat to be a puffer vest.
2.0,"Extremely heavy, but very pretty as well. Unfortunately, one of the earrings I was sent had a bad closure so I wouldn’t have been be able to wear them even if I could tolerate such a heavy earring."
2.0,The arm sleeves are far too small and there is no room for boobs. Also the fabric is sheer.
2.0,Beautiful top but it was NOT at all true to size.  The XXL was more like a L.  I was very sad to not get to wear this.
2.0,The bracelet is cute that's why I ordered it. There problem was the size. It barely fit my four year old niece when I originally bought it for myself.
2.0,Fit perfect everywhere except in the armpit area. I am going to try and exchange it for a bigger size
2.0,doesn't do what its supposed to.
2.0,Battery doesnt last long but is comfortable
2.0,"The footbed is fine, and the fit is ""almost"" fine. The part that really hurts is the part that goes between the toes. I've been wearing them for days and it still digs in.  It must be the angle of that part. I've never had flip flops that didn't stop hurting after a couple of days."
2.0,"Very cheap, see through material"
2.0,Just got the case. It's beautiful. But my phone won't stay in the case. I'm going to have to return it unfortunately.
2.0,"This was an adorable set. When I first put it on my baby (almost a year, in about 9m size) it was huge. I expected that, since she is pretty tiny. After one wash, though, it's way too small. The legs are now shorts and her diaper busts out of the snap part."
2.0,Very pretty but made small.
2.0,It got the job done for the day but the skirt began falling apart before the end of the night and it completely fell apart in the wash.
2.0,Shuts off by itself once in a while and slips down. Needs more straps if your going to run with it.
2.0,"It's kind of pretty,  but it doesn't glow in the dark.  I charged it in the light for plenty of time, but it doesn't glow at all."
2.0,Nickel free.....but just seems cheaply made. I wouldn't pay $35 for it again.
2.0,"POOR QUALITY AND SIZES AND SEWING HORRIBLE!!  CHEAP, But you get enough of them for the price.  Plan an Actually MAYBE USING 1/2  TOOK FOREVER AND EVER to Get it here from China!.  ALSO ,  DO NOT DEPEND on ANY of them BEING the SAME SIZE, I ONLY GOT 2 COLORS ALSO, Absolutely NOT ENOUGH Close to the Picture, JUST HOT PINK and BRIGHT BLUE, SOME Were  7 By 7's, some the Drawstrings WERE SEWN  INTO THE MIDDLE Of the Bag, ALL ARE CROOKED, CHEAP and OK for What I need, (Lavender Sachets), IF You need them for a WEDDING, OR anything, NO I WOULDN'T Recommended these!! MORE UPSET that I ONLY GOT 2 COLORS as a WANTED a VARIETY, AD IS MISLEADING, AND AMAZON should make them CHANGE THAT!!. I WILL Find a Different Supplier next next. THE DOLLAR TREE HAS Them 6 for a Dollar in the BABY SECTION ISLE, and THEY ARE ACTUALLY ALL THE SAME SIZE, I GET THEM THAT DAY, AND ALL SEWN CORRECTLY!!"
2.0,It's ripping already
2.0,"Didnt like the details on dress, poorly made"
2.0,I ordered a 5x but it will not fit.  I normally wear a 2or 3x at most.  Gave it to a relative to wear.
2.0,The arms  too tight
2.0,"I do not usually buy things in Plus size, but I really likedhow his looked in the picture. I was very disappointed when it fit snuggly on me and I am usually a regular large"
2.0,It's a beautiful earring but not for a tragus piercing.
2.0,"Ok quality, but it was clingy and not flattering at all."
2.0,"I would have thought the purpose of these gloves was to avoid getting fingerprints/skin-oil on glass/lenses/high-end equipment.  And I suppose they do prevent prints.  However, I tried using these to handle my DSLR camera, and so far from being lint-free, they positively *spewed* lint all over the camera and into all its crevices, simply not usable at all on anything you don't want to have to clean of lint afterwards.  They don't specifically advertise being lint-free but it would seem logical to expect that if you're wearing gloves to touch a delicate item, you don't want it to end up covered with a fine coating of lint."
2.0,"The toddler size fits my 3 year old, 31 lb girl. However after one wear (even before washing) it’s already pilling badly and looks old and worn. Not what I expected from dancewear that should stand up to some light use."
2.0,Smaller than expected. I had to return
2.0,"Well, it is pretty, but no instructions. Took,a while to figure out how to adjust the band, but it won't fasten. I'll probably get a leather band for it; until then, it stays in the box."
2.0,"Ordered 4xl, got something more like xl.  Very undersized. had to give them to a small friend."
2.0,Multifunctional bracelet and wrist hair removal tool.
2.0,The seams weren’t sewn correctly and split. Nice material. Not worth repairing though
2.0,The dress was pretty but not for short women. This dress would look best on your average-tall woman. I’m 5’1 and the dress fits more like a maxi dress on me. From the waist down it’s horrible and not so flattering on me. Didn’t work for me. I’ll be returning.
2.0,Much smaller than I wanted. The stones are nice though. Nice to give as a gift.
2.0,"Yeah the sunglasses I received are not really heart shaped at all, kind of disappointing."
2.0,These sunglasses did not fit tightly on my five-year-old face. They definitely slip off and he cannot keep them on. Not a good buy.
2.0,The earring constantly moves around and I’m having to fix it the whole time I’m wearing it! I think they are cute but having to constantly check to see if the earring has flipped is really a pain!!
2.0,The chain was nice but the pearl was very cheep!!!
2.0,Cheaply made for the price. Bought a size up since it was the only one that would arrive before halloween and it is tight fitting. I'm disappointed in this costume.
2.0,"I mean You can’t expect much from a costume wig, so if you have ever purchased a cheap wig you get what I’m saying. However I wasn’t impressed with this one because it was not shaped like the picture. Instead it was kind of wild and the hair seems much longer than the picture. So unless you want it to go SUPER FRO you gotta handle it gently or it would be a HOT MESS. If the hair was shorter then it would be much better."
2.0,"The pants had no pockets, and you can see through them."
2.0,"Ok so obviously I wasn't expecting much from a $20 watch made in China but as I was adjusting the day of the week it just stopped adjusting so I'm assuming it's broken, I can't change the day. I also don't like that with the English there is also Chinese lettering on the date scroll, why? I removed 3 links to make it fit which was fairly easy as I have a kit to do so. The weight is a little lighter than other stainless watches I have, feels fragile. As of now it's ticking and keeping the time so not a one star yet..."
2.0,"Low quality, runs very small.  I don't think I would wear this bra even if it fit."
2.0,Fits perfect when you stand like a statue and why are the models always very thin that prevents the truth about one size fit all and my waistline isn’t huge anymore but the slightest bend or a proceed to sit motion the wrap starts to disassemble while wearing it! Not worth wearing during workout or movement.
2.0,cute but top keeps going up on the back because the back have any type of closure.
2.0,Product is sewn different...too baggy in the front and always slips in the rear even with belt.
2.0,"This is by far the worst item I've received through Amazon. The crouch is tight, the belt has loose threads hanging from it and the entire garment reaked of cigarette smoke. I had to remove the bag and garmet from my room to get rid of the nasty smell! But what should I expect for an outfit under $30, right? (As I spray Febreeze all over myself and my house)"
2.0,Doesnt stay on ..flimsey..no lining.
2.0,"The concept is brilliant, however the execution not so much. The small is the size that fit me best, however while shampooing a clients head my entire finger turned purple and began to swell. I tried the medium but it was too big. Getting the ring cover onto the finger quickly (the small) was difficult as well. The size of my stone was too big for the allotted space given. I instead bought a fabric sleeve which works better and is much easier to take on and off. It doesn't turn my finger purple either. I would've preferred the silicone option as it decreases the amount of water that touches the ring but until I can find one that gives me better comfort I'll stick with the sleeve option."
2.0,"These coat to much. Material used to make them is not from top shelf. Well, overall it's fine but I'm sure there is a better quality available in close price range. I would not recommend this to anyone I know."
2.0,"Belt broke, some small part that holds the head of the belt in place broke off making it useless only 6 months after purchasing it with minimal wear."
2.0,Larger than anticipated.  Had to return.
2.0,"Pushes feet up to the top of your boot, making it feel much tighter."
2.0,"Poor fit, weird material, nice design. The kids were excited about this. The material is like polyester and thin and I wonder about the effectiveness of it. The mask is relatively flat and so does not make a good fit to the contours of a face. Bummer."
2.0,This company's bands fit well but fall apart quickly. The leather loops holding the end of the band pop off first.  Next came the clasp which just fell off. These products do not hold up more than 6 months.
2.0,Bracelet Showed up smaller than expected.
2.0,Way to heavy to have on your neck !
2.0,"It got delayed like four times, took like a month and a half to come and when it did come it was not what I was expecting. The material is not soft like it looks."
2.0,"Not what was expected.<br />For price, kinda not worth it :("
2.0,"Product came busted open and was spilled on the inside of package, horrible customer service and experience with this expensive shoe cleaner but it works"
2.0,"If you are size small but have larger than C cup size this may not fit you, just a heads up! Other than that it is what I was expecting."
2.0,Too large and very sheer. Cheap quality
2.0,It didn’t look much like the picture.. I’m 5’3 168Ibs I ordered a medium and it fit like the extra large..  it looks cheap and I want a refund only reason I gave it two stars because I can adjust the top and try to make it cute
2.0,The sunglasses are not worth that price.  The quality is really cheap that the glasses made of plastic only.
2.0,"The fit is good and why I gave it 2 stars. I like the length and how it sits, it could be flattering but the material is so cheap and the dots are so pronounced, instead of subtle, that it doesn't look cute."
2.0,"They feel great, but they are very thin, so you need to wear a quite a long dress or shirt with it"
2.0,These are crop pants
2.0,Sleeves are tighter than expected and the pockets poke out on the sides in a really bizarre way.
2.0,Loved this outfit but I had to sew the pants a bunch of times they kept ripping at the seams inside the legs
2.0,"I received my wallet today and I am so excited. I ordered this based on the good reviews especially the card slots.BUT They said card slots are easy to get ur card in and out of, but mine is hard. I have to force my card into it. Honestly, I cannot use the lower 2 card slots, like really. i bent my card coz im trying to fit my card into it. I honestly like this wallet because the number of card slots are perfect. I don't like extra/empty card slot. so 9 is perfect for me. The construction is prefect too. I like it's simplicity but functional and have lots of room. It's just the card slot. I dont know if i got a defective one. Im gonna return it.  35.99 is too much for me for the wallet that I can't really use........."
2.0,Definitely Asian sizes.Way too small.
2.0,"When I received this item it was gorgeous, very good stretchy quality, the body part fit perfect but on the breast part it was wayyyyy too small for the size I chose, I chose an XL because I am a C cup and the breast size was like a small B cup... I don't recommend this for anyone with large breast."
2.0,Zipper defective. Material thin
2.0,"I purchased the grey color sleeveless dress. The quality of the material is not good and it is see-through, but the style is pretty cute though and size is right."
2.0,"I should have read the reviews, usually masks with adjustable ear loops means they can be loosened up for a larger fit, but at the loosest setting these are still to small for my adult head and (admittedly) large ears."
2.0,Too many pieces and no instructions on how to put the outfit together. It was ill fitted and we had to use numerous saftey pins to hold some of the pieces in place.
2.0,I bought the biggest size they had and it fit as if it was 2 sizes smaller. Ended up looking like I was wearing a shirt and not a dress.
2.0,"I don't know who this shirt was made for, maybe an orangutan? The rest of the shirt fits fine, but the sleeves hang down about 6"" past my fingertips. I'm not exaggerating. And the sleeves are loose, so you can't just push them up. If you have abnormally long arms, you might be happy with top."
2.0,"Nice quality, but too small for my husband's hands."
2.0,"Wow, I tore through all the boxes a second time thinking I mush have missed a lot of items. Checked my order and I missed that this is really only for 3 items! They are cute and well made but not worth over $17. I am pretty disappointed in myself for not noticing."
2.0,the main bead is flaking off and turning white and it doesn't' stay tight
2.0,There was only 2 tank tops in package...supposed to be 3
2.0,"Very different fabric, i wanted to wear this to the gym but its def not that type of shirt! Not as comfy as a cotton t-shirt would of been!"
2.0,I expected a denim type material so boy was I surprised! They are silky slick shorts which I wear only around the house… not at all what I expected
2.0,He looks much nicer in the photo. The fit was tight
2.0,Very stretchy material. I was looking for an olive color sweater this is dark hunter green.
2.0,The fabric is dreadful.
2.0,"They are cute, but the stems are so long on the back. I had to use wire cutters to make them shorter to even wear.<br /><br />I wore the blue one time and the earring came off of the post."
2.0,Cute shoe but apparently the most popular feature of this princess shoe is that the bow with crown falls off while child walking. Used one time and shoe no longer useable for outfits they were tended for. Complete fail!
2.0,"These arrived on time which was great, but there was a flaw in mine. The eating was make backward, so you have to put it in behind your ear if you want to screw head I'm front."
2.0,I feel like what I received is the “reality” portion of expectation vs reality. Flimsy. Creased. Terrible form. Note how bad and misshapen it looks snapped too. Nothing like the photo. Arrives in a crumpled mess crammed inside a 5x7 baggie. Terrible. Who would want to receive this? This was for a gift too. Hard pass. Will be retuning immediately.
2.0,Love the design just not for my 8 year old. These masks fit as grown up masks and not for 5-12 year olds. Great fit for adults but not for kids
2.0,Both pairs fit differently. And definitely not anti fog
2.0,"I like the logo, but very loose."
2.0,These leggings are labeled as “black” but they are really a dark grey. These leggings are pretty see through but are a nice athletic material. I wish they were thicker.
2.0,"Cheap thin material, threads are already loose."
2.0,"Fabric is cheap and the green color is brighter than it looks in the picture. I am 5’8” and 140lbs and I can usually wear a small or medium, but this medium was very small on me."
2.0,Band broke after wearing it for one week
2.0,Much shorted than anticipated and I’m only 5’2”
2.0,Too small. I saw someone shorter than me that was my exact weight say it fit her perfectly but it was way too small on me. Couldn't even get it over my shoulders
2.0,"I really wanted to like this more than I did. I ordered the size I would traditionally order. It runs much smaller across the top than I anticipated. When putting it on I quickly realized it would not fit very well across the chest as I heard seams making a popping noise.<br /><br />I quickly stopped trying to put it on. Upon inspection it was obvious to me that the stitches were very close to the edges of the fabric. Too much pulling would pull most of the seams out of the fabric.<br /><br />The fabric was also much thinner than I would have liked.<br /><br />The fabric is very soft. The color is nice and matches exactly what I saw on my screen.<br /><br />If you are stuck on getting this shirt, I'd suggest you order up. And maybe a smaller busted person will find this works well for them."
2.0,"Definitely runs large (!), the dark purple is a nice shade, and the weight is substantial enough for early Fall. That said, this product was not listed as 95% polyester- and that’s what arrived today. I comb through the product descriptions looking to eliminate choices with polyester- no way I would have ordered this knowing that’s 95% of the content. I’m returning and giving two stars because I loathe when sellers do not provide accurate descriptions. If you like polyester, it has those other things listed above going for it."
2.0,"It's okay, very hard to get in ear"
2.0,"Beautiful dress, but not color-safe at all!<br /><br />I only got one wear out of the dress, unfortunately, because it’s a great dress otherwise. I was super careful washing it, even used several Shout Color Catcher sheets and soaked the skirt portion in cold water first, but it still bled into the white stripes on the top. I am so disappointed because the dress was perfect otherwise: great fit, fabric is a nice light jersey that hangs beautifully without being clingy or showing every lump or bump. This is why I am so disappointed, the dress was perfect other than the color transfer.<br /><br />Returned"
2.0,"This is NOT the same as is pictured.<br />The gold one I got was perfect, but the silver one looks like this."
2.0,Fit is snug. Feel is good and the glove is well made. Only problem is they do not keep your hand warm at all. Especially the fingers
2.0,"Sizing on this product is way off. It’s way too small. Aside from that, the zipper is awful regardless of zipping or unzipping. To top it off the shorts part of this romper is sheer, so that I could see my underwear through the gown.<br /><br />It’s a shame I can’t wear it, because it really is pretty, and the cut is flattering."
2.0,This shirt is not flat on the bottom. It is longer in the back making it tacky to wear without tucking it in.
2.0,I purchased 4 of these shirts in different colors. I tried them on when they came to make sure they fit in case I had to return them. They look great and they fit perfect. So I wash them as I should following the wash instructions and I go to wear the for work and they shrunk so bad I can't even wear them now. Very disappointed
2.0,"Very cheaply made not worth the price for the item I received stitching is already coming undone, I wouldn't recommend anyone purchasing this item."
2.0,Too small. Every store seems to have different sizing. I also thought the buttons were cheap looking.
2.0,It took me a minute to figure out how to adjust the strap but once I did it was so stupidly easy to adjust. The rhinestones are SHINY AND SPARKLY. I’m obsessed. It’s super comfortable.<br />UPDATE!!!!!!<br />I dropped it and the band broke. Looks gorgeous but doesn’t hold up long. :(
2.0,Not as flowy as pictured
2.0,Shoes are very cute but the velcro strap came unglued after 3 wears.  Not worth the return shipping cost.  Do NOT buy.
2.0,"These are much more like tights than leggings.  Paper thin, and very small."
2.0,The pockets made this look unflattering
2.0,"Too big for small chests. Not sure triangle top, has a weird  shape and the padding is incredibly stiff and cheap."
2.0,"I'm 5'4&#34;, 135lbs with 36C size. I ordered a XL based on the chart. The top area around the boobs fit, but the arms were long and it was super wide. The material was nice, but had to return it."
2.0,WAY smaller than we anticipated. We found ourselves sort of apologizing as we gave it for a Christmas gift.
2.0,Order bigger than you wear. Shorter than I expected
2.0,"I ordered three sizes smaller than I normally would (a small when I'd usually wear a large) and it's just entirely too big for any purpose. Also, one half of the garment just wasn't sewn at all. I couldn't believe it. I returned it and I won't be ordering it again. That being said, the fabric, although see-through is beautiful. I wish it fit better and had been made better."
2.0,"The fit and length is good, however, there is a rip that was there when it arrived. The buttons are cheap and leave gaps. I ordered another from a separate seller."
2.0,"You have to get a size larger than what you normally wear. It would be a great shirt, if it fit."
2.0,"I have ordered these socks in different colors, several times, and they've been awesome. Undortunately, this order is defective, there were holes in the ankle after 1 wash."
2.0,Neck hole too small... poor quality and design
2.0,Hearts wayy to small for my nipple.. I purchased these yesterday through a different seller and my chest is so sore from trying to put these in
2.0,This was very cheap and plastic looking.
2.0,Much smaller than I thought they would be
2.0,I’m 5’5” 126 lbs and ordered a medium due to reviews. This runs big!  Matronly looking as well.
2.0,"Since this item is supposedly 100% linen, I sized up and ordered a large to allow for shrinkage. Well I have washed this too 4 times: 1st in cold water, 2nd warm, then in hot water twice. I placed it in the dryer 4 times on high! Can you believe this item has not shrunk at all?!!! Unbelievably so, being that it is supposedly 100% linen! Aside from that, the weave is very light (almost see-through) and although the weave tighten a bit, it still looks nothing like the heavy looking linen in the photos. The embroidery is nice looking and did not bleed color after all that washing which I was happy about. My final review comment and most important is that this top is NOT 100% linen!!! Linen shrinks like crazy! This top did not shrink at all! Need I say, I will have to pull out the sewing machine to alter this top. Therefore it gave it 2 stars for the embroidery! If you are expecting the wonderful feel and drape of 100 % linen, you will be highly disappointed."
2.0,"Loved the look, but it was way smaller than an extra large!!!"
2.0,They scratch very easily
2.0,"Purchased for my 14yo son.  Didn't last a month. Don't buy.  Update, I banged it on the table and it started working again.  I'm still sending it back and just going to purchase something of higher quality."
2.0,Wastw pf money I am going to return the product.
2.0,"I loved the color, but the fit was way too big.  I have other swing dresses I love but this one just didn't work.  Return was very easy."
2.0,"It broke very early, design is good and soft fabric but it broke."
2.0,"Dark olive - almost black.  Look nice but huge compared to the other pants - different color, same size.<br />Black does not appear black.  More of a grey - tiny pinstripe.<br />Too slouchy, son didn't like style."
2.0,"Let me just say, that I still have not worn these leggings because they were so uncomfortable when I tried them on. Stiff with almost no elasticity. Took them off almost immediately and have never thought about wearing them again. A bust for your money. I never returned them either because they were that forgettable. Thought these were going to be like those TikTok leggings that everyone raved about. NOPE."
2.0,"Did not like the, too sparkly"
2.0,It’s ok. Kinda feels like a fuzzy robe
2.0,"This is clearly designed for a different watch with wider connection points, such that the wider band kinks up within the more narrow connectors and so looks crappy and feels weird. It's too bad, the material and design is very nice, but it doesn't fit correctly and is as a result insecure on the Sense. If you want you $300 watch to hit the ground - buy it!"
2.0,Elastic in waistband is wide and rolls :(
2.0,Its very Small and its very tight  not able to use only kids can wear this
2.0,I have another pair in the same size and they fit great.  The light blue pair was not as stretchy and also ripped in the crotch after he first wear.  I’m very disappointed.  :(
2.0,"These glasses gave me a headache and they are in a drawer.  However, they look really nice."
2.0,"Way to small, so the person that I bought it for can't wear it. Nice quality shirt.  Put in for a return, but time to return was short time span and due to printer complications I couldn't get it out by the return date, when I tried to resubmit for return, it was not an option, so I am out the $35 for a shirt that can't be worn."
2.0,"Received my package yesterday and finally got around to trying on today.  They looked to be of good quality and I was anxious to try them on.  Based on the  reviews and based on the comments on here, I went with my usual size.  Big mistake!  These run at least one size smaller than usual US sizes.  They will have to go back."
2.0,The size of a quarter...
2.0,I year later and it is falling apart. You get what you pay for I guess.
2.0,The pads inside does not stay in place.  the pads  move all around and were way above my breast and  I had to go in the bathroom at work 3 times to put them in place.  Not good
2.0,Not nearly as long as in photo.
2.0,Material is not well made and it runs EXTREMELY SMALL! I ordered two sizes up based on the reviews and it was still too small but im keeping it because its not worth the time or effort to return it for $9.00.  i normally wear a size Large in everything ...i ordered a 2X and it was still very tight in the mid section AND arm length.
2.0,"Super cute bathing suit and fit pretty well for the most part with the exception of the top. I’m very hour glass shaped and loved the fit at the bottom and the tummy control. Unfortunately, for the amount of boobs I have. I personally prefer wired bras/bathing suit tops but this one did not have that and was VERY revealing. Definitely could not bend over or make any sudden movements without fearing my boobs would completely fall out."
2.0,The quality of the fabric is cheap. I bought the white blouse and it is see through. I wont be buying it anymore.
2.0,"I bought this item multiple times and some batches were good and some weren't. In the batch I just ordered, I only got 14/100 that were usable. Most keychains were scratched and had marks on them. I contacted them before, and they sent me replacement ones, but they did not help me the second time. They never got back to my email after expressing what was wrong with the keychain. Overall, it is very hit or miss."
2.0,When I sit down they do not give like the ones I am use to. I have been wearing the ones with more polyester in them which stretched more. For me these just were not comfortable.
2.0,Really disappointed in the quality. Even for $20 this is unacceptable. Returning for sure. Picture is how it looked straight from the package. A knot in the chain and at first I thought it was “something wet” on the stone. It is the adhesive all over the stone. Highly disappointed!
2.0,NOT a push up. Itchy and uncomfortable. Do not but this.
2.0,Love them at first sight... so cute but as days went by they started turning green so bum out because I thought they was made from sterling silver
2.0,If you use the last clasp the material will scratch your skin.  It's extremely uncomfortable. I wear the same size bra in other brands and do not have the same problem.
2.0,It’s small in my face
2.0,"Not very stretchy, itchy from not hypoallergenic materials."
2.0,"The bust of the dress and the material was great, but the length was too short, when I tried to bend over  my underwear was exposed. I had to return it."
2.0,Actual size is much smaller than what clothing charts indicate. I bought this for my wife as a surprise using her actual measurments and provided clothing size chart. Was very disappointed.
2.0,The threads are crooked and the joints are visibly out.
2.0,Poor quality expensive for nothing
2.0,The quality is great but the color is totally off. The real color is more brown but not really nice brown 😔
2.0,"Length was good, purchased a small, I’m 5’2.  Waist good but the bust, too tight, I’m b,and I haven’t washed it yet , we’ll see if any shrinking well I guess it’s good will"
2.0,I wanted to like this but it was too see through
2.0,"I love the zipper concept, but the tie is pretty cheap looking.  I'm not sure I'll actually wear this one."
2.0,Holes on the end were to small to fit my sunglasses.
2.0,Material is somewhat silky and not cotton. The shirts are comfortably big however the shirt is awkwardly too large. Can’t even make it look cute off the shoulder. Top is very boxy.
2.0,Shoes are cute and comfy but run way too big.  I estimate he will get to wear them when he is 2-3 years old.
2.0,"[[VIDEOID:e572c9f41f42730768fa1f71af2e612f]] Order is incomplete, as you can see, there are NO piercing studs OR alcohol pads, and one pair of earrings is missing a backing"
2.0,"Although I usually really like Allegra K items, this one is the first one I've ever actually returned. The sleeves were short and didn't even look like 3/4 sleeves, they just made it look like my shirt didn't fit. Also, it was SUPER thin. If it wasn't white then I would just wear an undershirt, but even with a tank top underneath you could see my skin tone some and that would not be appropriate at work for me.<br />On the plus side, I liked the black buttons on the white shirt and it had a good length and fit otherwise."
2.0,"Very disappointed with this item; it is unwearable.  The color is neon and fabric has a weird feel to it.  Plus, it is way too small."
2.0,Not worth the money. Already discoloring. Lost the charm on the first day.
2.0,White socks still visible on boat shoes/ loafers. Defeated the whole point of the purchase.
2.0,"Dress is cute, quality seems good but it was soooooo big from the waist down... super wide and long! I am 5’2 and I ordered a small, it went past my knees and was so wide at the bottom it made me look huge... the pockets ended up laying right at the widest part of my thighs so that didn’t do me any favors either"
2.0,"I’m so torn. This swimsuit fits perfectly and it’s so cute!! However, it bled the first time I wore it and I have been afraid to wash it as I predict it will ruin other clothing items 😭 The towel I sat on by the pool had a bright orange booty print when I sat up!"
2.0,Large and did not fit well
2.0,Did not finish and not adjustable. Would not recommend.
2.0,Fabric was a lot stiffer than it looks in the product picture. I ended up giving it away.
2.0,Stitching coming loose after first wash
2.0,"So I wasn’t expecting much, since it’s like they bought some cheap hats and put a cheap fan in it and charge $50+. Customer support, not an option. You can diy this, not that hard. Also are they joking with the construction helmet fans, I can only imagine a brick hits you in the head with that helmet. You’d be a vegetable."
2.0,Soft material. But WAY too small. I am a 42-44 B. So I ordered XXXL. This would fit someone who is a 32 A
2.0,The clip is not steady and hard to put.
2.0,"Unfortunately, the fabric of the dress began to rip after a couple of wearings. The style was great but the quality was not up to par."
2.0,They were athletic material but they were very small! Probably should have sized up 2-3 times
2.0,"I was really looking forward to this shirt. While the fit was good, there were a couple of things that I didn’t like. First off, the graphic is not very clear. It looks like a homemade iron-on job. Also, after the first time I washed it, almost all of the thread came out of the bottom of the shirt leaving a very long string in the dryer. This surprised me because the shirt is a Gildan. Normally, they are good t-shirts so I don’t know what the deal was with this one."
2.0,I like the actual shoe the quality is actually pretty good. The only problem is the straps that you receive with them. They are way too long so I had to end up purchasing my own straps. Otherwise it’s pretty good.
2.0,"Color not as rich as pictured, more like a running out pink highlighter."
2.0,Did not improve night time visibility / Halo effect on lights
2.0,"I wish I could wear it, it's beautiful. Unfortunately, the necklace arrived broken already even though there was no damage to the package. Returning."
2.0,"Luz digital muy tenue, de día no se aprecia bien"
2.0,"Other than the zipper issue, I like the coat. It fits well, it's comfortable and keeps me warm."
2.0,I love it - but the strings have already broken. So...I could only give it a two.
2.0,the cz band and the chain are twisted and it makes it difficult to wear.
2.0,Hat was too small and there was not enough netting
2.0,"These turned gold. Stainless steel doesn’t generally do that. So not sure these r actually SS. Never had an issue with SS so not satisfied but considering the price, u get what U pay for!!"
2.0,Bad material.<br />I hand rinsed just the bottom flare and it shrunk by few inches.
2.0,If feels good and soft
2.0,"The shoes are very comfortable but the elastic broke in less than a month & now they fall off with every step I take.  I thought I found the answer to too big slippers but it was not to be.  Such a shame.  If you have wide feet & ankles these are for you.  If not, don't bother. My feet are long & slim.  I need a 10, not an XL10."
2.0,Seems very light.  Not sure it would survive a good hit with a baseball bat.  I like the look and design however all my other helmets are larges and this large is way bigger. also don't like the plastic strap buckle. Honestly after wearing this helmet I just wouldn't trust my life to it in a crash. Maybe good for AT-V or Go Carts
2.0,"I ordered two necklaces 8.5-9.5mm, 18 in and 22 in length, hoping to wear them together. The 18 in pearls were extremely lackluster but whiter in color, whereas the 22 in one had a better shine but appeared a little pinkish, so they can’t be worn together. In addition, the earrings were not the same size of pearls as the necklace: they’re noticeably smaller and flat instead of round. Lastly, one of the gift boxes was busted during transportation. The return had to be at a UPS store and we had to provide packaging. Refund still hasn’t happened and it’s been over a week. Proceed with caution."
2.0,"Its a nice product.  I thought id size down  to xl given its stretchy fabric.<br />Im 5' 1/2"" weigh 140, 39-30-39. And 34dd.<br />The size chart says i should order an xxl. So.far.off.  i should have ordered a small or medium.  This was made for someone 7ft tall. Very frustrating. I normally wear medium to large if the large is on the smaller side. There is an extra 10 inches in the crotch and the arms are way too deep. Im going to see if my daughter can wear it, but honestly, i tire of these attempts to buy from these size charts. Its become...insulting"
2.0,"Kind of disappointed.  I bought these (and another similar pair by another brand) as a stocking stuffers for my daughter.  They don't screw in - so the earrings will fall out.  They are really pretty, but I am afraid since they are loose, they will fall out and she will lose them. :(  Not sure I should still give them to her.  Both brands wont screw in and stay tight.  BUMMER."
2.0,The bifocal portion was fine but the overall construction of the sunglasses is sub par at best. There's a cheap coating on the frames that if left in the sun (go figure) peels like an orange. They also do not clean very well.
2.0,"Cute enough, but the nose piece broke off within minutes of opening them."
2.0,The outfit is cute but the top was extremely large.
2.0,The pocket placement is useless. They’re too far to the side to be used for anything. Returning mine.
2.0,"That's my only issue with this hat. It is very small, particularly for a man."
2.0,"Very thin material. In one day, a button fell off"
2.0,"After opening the shipping bag and removing the sweater from the poly bag, I was disappointed to find the front lower part of the sweater was shredded. The color, pattern, and softness of the sweater seems to be as expected, but unfortunately this item arrived in an unusable condition. Neither of the bags it arrived in showed any external signs of distress or damaged, so the sweater was either packaged in this condition or unraveled in after being packed."
2.0,I found the material to be clingy and the lace was very flimsy. I returned it.
2.0,more or less
2.0,More lightweight thatn exxpected
2.0,"The zipper area is just useless, I am not sure why it is even there. You HAVE to take off the whole outfit to change a diaper. I also understand why the picture shows over the shoulder, it really does that when you get the product. It hangs a little weird maybe the picture shown is a bigger size? I got 18-24 months in (my kids are in 18 months), don't get me wrong the outfit is ADORABLE but this is why it is hard to buy things online.<br /><br />UPDATE: After washing before letting my twins wear them I noticed the legs needed to be resewed. One picture attached, didnt even think about taking proof until i was done with a whole leg! I can deal with the zipper thing but no one wants to have to resew their outfits before wearing. Thats just bad quaility."
2.0,Super cute! But when i put it in i couldnt close it when i tried due to being too small and was too close to skin without hurting myself. Be better as a clicker
2.0,"Okay watch, not my style"
2.0,"This dress was very cute but not the material i thought it was and the top kept sliding down, with and without a bra. It was returned."
2.0,Did not fit as expected and the top was extremely too short. I ordered a Medium and am 5/2 120 lbs. The shirt was too short and fit way too tightly. Not to mention the cross in the back was not as pictured.
2.0,an awful color and not as long as they look in the photo
2.0,Ordered as nightgown as described. My wife thinks style is more of a robe. Too hot for nightgown. Too cold for robe.
2.0,Although this product fit as expected the stickiness runs out real quick you might as well just wear a bra because you’re gonna keep pulling this thing up all night long if you have big boobs
2.0,"Service was slow to send.  The glasses are small and fit an 8 year old.  My 11 year old was disappointed because he waited so long for something that he ended up giving to his younger brother.  The rear view feature does work, which was the positive about these glasses."
2.0,"I was so excited to purchase this bracelet; I'd had it on my wish list for quite some time.  But I was disappointed when I saw it in person.  The pictures of the planets look somewhat cartoonish, and the metal seems like it would turn my skin green. It is not a piece of jewelry I would wear in public at my age, not even in fun.  I should have expected something like this based on the price."
2.0,The product in the picture looks more tan whereas the one I recieved looks green and the skull face isn't as prominent as the one in the picture as well. I'll keep it though. It will work for its intended purpose to keep dust out of my mouth and nose.
2.0,My 9 year old grandson put this on once and the clasp that held it on the black braided necklace came undone. Very low quality for the price I paid.
2.0,Compression fair except strips inside sock cut into skin and left deep depressions in skin.<br />Suggestion leave even compression for entire sock.  It hurts.
2.0,it fits but is see through so i unfortunately wont be able to wear it
2.0,Threads on the screw parts of these never line up I've almost gotten these things stuck multiple times even with help.  Not worth the money.
2.0,It's a very unshapely piece of fabric
2.0,Did like the quality
2.0,cheap frame (bent on 2nd day just by taking them off) and the lenses themself make vision blurry making you not want to wear them.
2.0,"The photo is misleading. The color ended up being much lighter than the dark purple I was expecting, and the dress is not a razor back. It also wrinkles easily and isn’t really something I’d feel comfortable wearing to a special occasion."
2.0,My son is 3 and the smallest size was way too long for him.
2.0,Broke after very little use. Metal prongs are cheaply made.
2.0,"Worked good until dropped, one drop and it stopped working"
2.0,They didn't last long before they broke
2.0,"It does not have fullness in legs. It is too short in length for tall women.<br />I kept it for business meetings,etc.<br />Not comfortable with how it wears;)"
2.0,"Comes in weird blue hard plastic envelope. Chain was busted, right out of the package, and card was very bent."
2.0,"Does not look like the on-line photo which clearly shows a polished silver lion’s head with polished silver rings on each side every so often between some of the black lava beads! The bracelet I received has a dark coppery looking lion’s head with dark coppery rings between every two lava beads up to four lava beads on each side and the rest of the bracelet is plain black lava beads. Additionally, this stretchy bracelet is too tight around my 8 inch wrist and is not very stretchy!  I recently purchased two different men’s  Zenger stretch bracelets each of which is advertised to fit an 8 inch wrist and they both are perfect. This one is not!! Very disappointed."
2.0,The shirt fits fine. The color and pattern are like in the picture but the cut and fabric are nothing at all like the picture!! I was very disappointed. I paid good money for something that turned out to be very cheaply made.
2.0,My husband said too large and hot
2.0,Sizing is way off. Ordered for my one year old and these look like they will fit a 4-6 year old. They're cute and maybe we'll save them for when she's older but they will not fit any time soon nor do they fit her older sister (who wears a size 8-9 toddler shoe).
2.0,So it’s cute and seems like decent quality however it’s way to small .... I’m plus size sure but most of the time I have no issues with a 2x I think I ordered the 3x and it’s snug snug snug ...will most likely be sending back sadly
2.0,Its an ok a beanie but I was expecting what was pictured.  The beanie I recieved came with a teal pom instead of the faux animal one as shown.  The all teal version makes it look childish.
2.0,The sleeves are cut extremely tight for the style and cut into the arms. For the size that I ordered they should have been designed a little better.
2.0,kinda tight but its good because it wasnt see through. Length was good too.
2.0,These glasses were way to wide for me.  I'm returning them.
2.0,Looked cute online but runs very small.
2.0,Nice band for 10 months. Then it started to slip out of clasp.  I had to adjust it multiple times per day.  Finally added electrician's tape to make it thicker.
2.0,I just don't like see though fabric and this one is
2.0,"They look okay, but are made badly and fall apart fast. I can't recommend them."
2.0,"Had to give to my 14 yr old niece way too small for a adult the pants were like low riders half of your butt is out, also I can tell they won’t wash well definitely get lint balls"
2.0,These would be great if the stayed on the head well when used as a headband
2.0,"When I pulled it out of the package its material seemed very thick and sturdy. All the zippers worked without binding. However, the flap covering the front pocket would not stay closed because the magnetic clasp was not strong enough. Also, the water bottle pocket was very small and didn’t have much elasticity."
2.0,"Fit is good (could be a little looser around the middle), I like the top pattern. But whoa the shorts!! The fit is good. No weird bulging or too tight around the legs....but they are ARE SEE THROUGH. They are so see through you can see the crack of my tush through the material. You can almost read the tag instructions as well. Disappointed because I needed a whole set not just a top for summer."
2.0,I am very disappointed in the earrings. The earrings I ordered had a discolored stone and the earrings broke my ears out in rash
2.0,The print is nothing as advertised. It is pixelated and fussy amd the material is uncomfortable. I am disoppointed was eagerly anticipating this
2.0,Just cheap don't really like it
2.0,Kinda disappointed with this and I was previously so excited.<br />The photos on site are deceptive. The enamel shows as near clear or silver/gray colored. The whole piece looks to be one silver color but what I got was the same necklace but made ugly with dark black 'enamel' (which looks more like poured colored resin) on the leaves and randomly placed on the stems. Why even bother with that?<br />When I first saw this piece it made me think of something out of LOTR or more fantasy based I could wear with a costume or cosplay...but the dark 'enamel' just completely ruins the look. I guess I should have looked at the reviewer pics before ordering.<br />It would cost more to send back than it cost me to buy so it will probably become a white elephant gift in the future.<br /><br />It arrived ahead of time and didn't cost much...there's at least that.
2.0,Boning comes out and garment stretches out. Can't wear it 2 times! Returned it!
2.0,My daughter did not like the fit or material.
2.0,Didn’t like it over stretches and looses shape
2.0,"I bought this watch in January 2017 because I really liked its looks and have always wanted one from the Junkers line. The watch seems to be running precise so far.<br />Unfortunately its build quality does not live up to the pricing. The watch fogged up when I was outside during a rainfall (it is supposed to be waterproof up to 3 ATM, which should be good enough for these conditions). And this morning, the metal wristband broke all of a sudden causing the watch to fall. The connection to the body seems to be poorly made. I have contacted Amazon about this issue. My last watch lasted for over ten years and I have treated this one much more carefully.<br />At almost 350 Dollars I expect better."
2.0,Sleeves were extremely long and it didn’t come down in the front around the neck far enough. I kept having to pull at it but it kept going back.
2.0,They leak. Sounds good but don't expect much. They provide false security. They leak.
2.0,Only was able to use one of my belly rings because the other one doesn’t unscrew. The one I was really looking forward to.
2.0,"i was so pleased when this swimsuit arrived. i wanted a really simple one piece for my daughter, and it fit the bill nicely. however, after the first wear and trip to the pool it was already pilling and fuzzy on the bottom area. it looked like it had been worn for months. disappointing!"
2.0,The outfit looks nothing like the pictures. It's cheap feeling material and a metallic fuschia color. It doesn't look too bad once I put it on. But it was not at all what I was expecting.
2.0,I can't open the clasp - looks like a nice rope chain - just what I wanted except useless if I can't get it open - I will continue to work with this and hope I don't break it trying to open it .......
2.0,I gave it two stars because I like the size but the clasp and earrings bent out of shape the second time I wore them.
2.0,"The dress is pretty, but when I held it up I was honestly shocked and went to check if I had ordered a juniors dress. The small looks like it would fit on a 10 year old. Also the material although double layered is still slightly see-through. Not very impressed at all."
2.0,"Fabric was so thin that you could see straight through it, the stitching around the neck was puckered, making it look feminine, and it ran very small"
2.0,Bought these because I have poor circulation.  At first they worked alright.  Later I had to stop using them because they burnt the back of my hands.
2.0,"When I received it, it had a string hanging off it about 12"" long, the entire them unraveled.  Should have returned it."
2.0,Small my butt.lol too huge.my teen is tiny. Bout 97lbs 5 2....top huge n frompy with big padding bottoms lil big but fit...not as sexy as pic at all. Top looks like shirt. Not cut good .Exactly 4 weeks to deliver. we will use 4 the river or lakes n creeks... or extra in beach bag 4 company .price makes me not so upset .
2.0,The weight is only 2 grams. Money spent on lemons
2.0,Nice bracelet but came apart after 2 days of normal wear.
2.0,A lot larger than advertised.  Definitely not for a baby girl.
2.0,It was way to much for the product but it was very comfy
2.0,This watch's face is vintage and impressive; however the band is a wrap around double band and it was bought for a teen and was too cumbersome to wear.  Did not like.
2.0,The colors are bright and fun and the material is soft...but...Seams let loose after 2 wears along the bottom ruffle.  My daughter is not hard on her sleep clothes.  Very disappointed .
2.0,"My husband ordered this outfit for me as a surprise just bc gift and I wanted to be in love with it . I love it bc he bought it for me , but I know he’s mad bc it’s falsely advertised. It’s not the same out fit in the pic. The color patterns are Completely different . Picture shows a black, purple and light blue color ,and it arrived purple , light blue and dark blue which didn’t match my shoes like I originally bought it to do . There is no black on it at all . The material is spandex not cloth, and it’s not even the cute spandex it’s the big thick bulky spandex. Its also extra big in the waist area for both the bottoms and tops . The tie part you see on the pic doesn’t exist . And bc of the fabric you can’t even create your own tie comfortably, and if u do manage to it won’t look right bc the bottoms are big around the waist area so you’re gonna wana cover that up . Cute idea, bad execution and false advertising."
2.0,Son loved it but way to small
2.0,"This dress doesn’t look like the picture. It looks narrow in the waist on the picture but it is not like that in real life. It is HUGE around her frame! It is okay in length but really really wide! I always get size 2-3 on amazon which is size 100, and it usually fits her but not this time. My daughter turned 2 this month and big for her age, around 28 pounds."
2.0,Does not look like the picture and also too small.  I am returning it.
2.0,Not sure if I got a size too small for my son but the material ripped open. Shoes were completely ruined. He only had them on for 10 minutes max in the indoor swimming pool
2.0,"I really liked the way the gloves felt and fit when I first put them on.  I probably bought the wrong thing for what I needed, but I couldn't find what I wanted.  I use them for barn gloves and they certainly are not designed for any kind of real use.  I am sure if you were just using them for walking around and texting, they might be sufficient.  My main complaint is that everywhere there is stitching it is coming apart and I have owned them for only a month.  This is not due to wear from use, it is from taking them off and putting them on a lot.  I would think that would be a problem no matter how you use them.  I really need this style of flip mittens because I have to use a pocket knife a lot and don't like to take gloves off all the time to do that.  Gloves also are never as warm as mittens no matter what they are made of.  They are fairly warm, but the thumb hole, which presumably is for texting is very annoying because my thumb is always getting exposed and cold."
2.0,I didn’t like these pants because they weren’t for running or for high intensity workouts you would swear and you can see your sweat right through your pants
2.0,Clip is like a small money clip hard to put on and off .  Emblem does not rotate
2.0,"Like another Titanium necklace I purchased, this one shipped from overseas and it too a while. The necklace is fine and the price is right, just don't expect it to get there fast."
2.0,Two of the same shorts came with the (lightening bolt & Star) two different shirts.
2.0,"I thought these would be a lot cooler in person than they turned out to be. Something I could wear casually while gaming with friends, but they aren't that cool. The tint on the lenses is far more orange than what is shown in the picture. You don't see any color in whatever you are staring at due to this orange tint. They aren't as wide as advertised either."
2.0,"They r definitely cute,medium compression, TTS 4 the brand. Sadly they are c thru if u squat, the zipper is difficult & the fabric pilled & I know they won't last. If u have $ 2 spare, then I'd say they r a gd deal, just b/c they r unique looking."
2.0,broke 2 months after purchase.
2.0,The color was not like 14 ct more like 10ct and was too big
2.0,"I bought this item for crafting, but about 10% of the keys were broken when I checked the items. There was no sign of damage to the package, so I suspect poor quality.  I did request a replacement as they keys were attractive and the size I needed, but the item was out of stock at the time Amazon received the returned damaged keys.  Based on what I received, I would not recommend."
2.0,"I got a pack for myself but when I opened the box, one of the camels was choppy looking and some strings were loose. It just looked sloppily made. Such a bummer too because these are soft and seem like they could be warm. But for $13 I would rather wait for a better deal on socks I know will not fall apart."
2.0,"Loved this sweat shirt, just too dang short! So disappointed I couldn’t keep it!"
2.0,"Well, my first Casio F-91W lasted over 30 years. Tough as nails. This replacement lasted less than 1 year before developing a ""windshield crack"" that started at the edge of face and slowly extended across it. Plastic face also scuffs easily. Watch was never dropped or banged. Casio does have a 1 year warranty, but you have to send back postage paid. Who is going to do that for a $10 watch? Still works, but a bit hard to read."
2.0,Arms are too tight
2.0,I gave it to a friend who loves the suit. The sizes are not correct.
2.0,to small!!!!!
2.0,"They look nice online, but should come in some better packaging for the price.  They seem so cheap when they come in a crappy little plastic bag wrapped in some wacky lace or whatever that was."
2.0,The material these are made out of is flexible but the L And Screw shape pieces have a hard angle!  It makes it almost impossible to slide them in nicely without it feeling like you are scraping the inside of your piercing hole.  It is not fun whatsoever.
2.0,"It serves its purpose in covering head, but its cheaply made. This cap is flimsy and came with a weird smell. I doubt id order from this seller again. The quality was disappointing for what i paid for it."
2.0,"Wasn't that impressed. I actually only bought these for part of my halloween costume, so wasn't looking for anything long term. But they annoyed me all day long. Had to keep pulling them up as they kept sagging. I originally bought the large based on the size chart, but then i returned those and got a medium. Those i guess were still too big or too much stretch, or not enough compression."
2.0,Handles too stiff and hard.
2.0,"While my wife liked this Wasing 35L backpack enough to buy another one for her friend, I frankly can't stand wearing it. It is lightweight, but the complete lack of any frame/structure/stiffness means it sags considerably even when moderately filled and everything you put inside seems to try and sink to the very bottom of each pocket. Because of this, the backpack droops low on your back and tugs at your shoulders in an uncomfortable way. And no matter what the description of the item says, there is NO CHEST STRAP, which might have saved it. We bought this because we were looking for something with lots of pockets and two water bottle holders for when we're out with our two kids and while it ticks those boxes, I otherwise find it a pain (literally, it hurts my back). For only $17 I'm willing to say it was worth testing out but now I just want to get rid of it."
2.0,The shirt ripped when grandson put it on.
2.0,These are so cool to watch change when wet but the blue one broke after first time using it :( cheaply made
2.0,"Strap latch fell off purse after a few months, unfixable."
2.0,I’ve had it less than a year and it already broke.
2.0,Most definitely see&fel the difference between real & not
2.0,Way too small for size ordered
2.0,I bought this necklace thinking the chain would be as thin and light as it looks in this pic but that wasn't the case when I received the necklace itself. The chain is thick and the gold looks extremely and noticeably fake! Almost as if it were meant to be a &#34;dress up&#34; toy necklace for 5 year olds. I was so disappointed. I'm glad I paid next to nothing for it otherwise I would have had a fit.
2.0,It is baggy on me and I don't like the way it looks.
2.0,I don’t like the material it doesn’t look anything like the picture but it is nicely made.
2.0,They do not work well with glasses at all.
2.0,The earrings are pretty but they are flimsy and cheaply made.
2.0,Small fit buy a size larger.
2.0,I only received 2 necklaces instead of the 3. Which was disheartening when I opened the package. Other than that they were what I excepted 🤗
2.0,"I’m 5’7”, 135lbs and I bought the small. It fit expect for the length. I have longer torso, so the dress barely covered my butt. I would not have felt comfortable leaving the house in it."
2.0,It’s REALLY big. :(
2.0,This is cute and looks oh so nice. It’s really thin and cheap looking. The color is actually a true bright red and not the color displayed. Definitely cost more than what it’s worth.
2.0,Not very comfortable and they really mess up peripheral vision.  They still fog and the way the arm tips flex back out they interfere when masking.
2.0,It shrunk even on low heat.
2.0,Very thin and clingy cotton material. Appears to be thicker and I thought that it was grey. Its baby blue.
2.0,This bag was not comfortable on my shoulder and had much more 'bling' than was described.  I have returned it.  The shipping was on time and it seemed to be well made.  I may look for there types of handbags from this maker.
2.0,ordered XL and it did not fit around the shoulder.
2.0,Pants are ok material is not the best
2.0,I don't like the polyester. I prefer cotton!
2.0,The material is awful but the pattern is beautiful I sent it back I would be drowning in sweat.
2.0,They just don't compress in the way I need everybody's body is different they just don't work with mine but they would make a good knee socks
2.0,Wish it was larger. Great design.
2.0,"I bought this because it states in the description "" perfect for running trails & training in the cold."" but this is the thickness of pantyhose. It might keep you warm if it's 50º out, but this is NOT meant for cold weather. I thought it might be at least wind resistant since it was so thin, but It just wouldn't do the trick. I am still looking for something descent that is for running."
2.0,"Top Heavy Design, so the charm hangs upside down on a necklace.  I suppose it would work fine on a bracelet?<br />The 2 pieces are also slightly magnetic, but opposite poles so that they repel each other a bit - strange"
2.0,This band is comfortable but it doesn't stay connected to the fitbit. I may just return them if it falls off one more time. Very frustrating. I definitely would not recommend.
2.0,would be cute if it weren't completely sheer.
2.0,Item bent and stones dirty. Quality is lower than expected.
2.0,Fits well around the waist but is saggy on the bottom... the elastic on the string is nonexistent. Not great quality but I kept them.
2.0,"Boxier and shorter than expected. Pretty unflattering. I gave it 2 stars because it seemed to be well made, and I am taller than average (5'9) so I'm sure it would be longer on most women"
2.0,"Nice glass, frames are VERY lightweight. Looked good, but screw fell out of temple after 2 weeks of use and temple fell off. Really should last at least past the return date........"
2.0,"hi folks<br />your nose pins are plastic and unpliable. my wife tried to bend the pin to fit not realizing it was plastic not metal. the plastic snapped instantly.the setting she loved, but cannot wear either of the two pins."
2.0,If you are in the U.S. order a size larger.
2.0,It’s cute but it was snug
2.0,Very thin fabric. Not as I expected from picture. More like cheap cutting cape. Definitely wouldn't use for a chemical client with long hair.
2.0,"Strange fit.  Probably Asian sizing, but nice quality.  Probably should have returned it.  Shoulders may be difficult to deal with as they seem incorrectly designed, to me.  Seems an odd cut and shape at the shoulders."
2.0,"Kinda get what you pay for here.  This skull cap is NOT &#34;cashmere-like&#34; at all as the description said.  The style is very similar to the picture, not as slouchy though.  The pattern looks better in the picture too.  However, the shipping was a lot faster than they originally quoted me, so that was nice."
2.0,"The purse has a strong smell when you get it out of the bag, and it has to be aired out for a few days before using it. The sides are wrinkled up and can’t be smoothed out. You get what you paid for."
2.0,Ordered an XL for my mom but fits more like a medium
2.0,legs fit but waist comes way too far up!
2.0,"Sized small, weird clingy fabric. Using it as pajamas!"
2.0,Cute and functional but it smells horrible! I tried everything to freshen it up but the smell won't go away.
2.0,"It’s a cute everyday top. Keeps you warm but....i don’t know why they have 1 size. It’s clearly huge. And mind you I’m 148lbs with 34C, waist 30 and hips 40. It was pretty big. If you looking for a slushy big sweater, this is it then. Also, I hated the material. The fuzz was all over my leggings. Definitely wear it with jeans only."
2.0,Want to return!
2.0,Cheap quality.. material started ripping around the shoulder area after the first wash. And it’s very thin material
2.0,"Beautiful dress as on picture, light in weight and very comfortable but it doesn't give. If you're top heavy the XL will not work. Need XXXL which company does not offer."
2.0,Bought xlarge as I bought it before and it fits... now it seems as if it is 2x. Not pleased.
2.0,It hurts lol it’s uncomfortable! I couldn’t even keep it on for more than a few minutes
2.0,"I’m 5’6”, 172, and ordered a L. The fit is true, and the fabric is very soft and cozy. I plan to wear it at home, because I like to look nice there, too, but it could easily work for casual activities and errands, too."
2.0,very difficult for a four year old to open and close.
2.0,I’m super bummed out. I have worn a wodbottom ring for years. It’s been my go to for everything when I don’t want to wear my nice set. I recently lost mine and immediately reordered another one. I didn’t even search for another company because I loved mine so much and trusted the quality and durability. I had my previous ring for 6 years and it was still going strong. They have definitely switched manufactures since I purchased my last one because it is not the same. My old one was soft and rubbery and very comfortable. This one is ultra rigid and more plasticky and is very uncomfortable to wear. I’m very disappointed :(
2.0,I love them my daughter not so much they are cloth like material.
2.0,The fabric is uncomfortable.
2.0,"Ordered L, fits my xsmall daughter perfectly."
2.0,ordered it for my son and he was so dissapointed when it arrived.<br />it will fit a kid.<br />for sure not a young men.
2.0,ordered M  but looks small
2.0,Looks similar to picture but the black t shirt is almost see thru and the acid wash looking part is crusty. Not sure why that is but hoping it comes out in wash.
2.0,"They feel good, like they are high quality, but the keep trying to open, the spring holding the clips closed is rather weak."
2.0,Plastic...more gold in color than anything.
2.0,I loved the style but I guess they were too delicate for me  They kept bending and broke after a couple weeks.
2.0,The top i received ran about 2 sizes small. The design is &#34; painted on&#34; with a thick layer making the front of the shirt a little stiff. Also when I took it out of the packaging it was very very wrinkled. Not sure this would wash very well.
2.0,"Turned by ear hole black and constantly got stuck on my hair and clothes. It was pretty but I can’t use it anymore. If you’re willing to take it out all the time, it might work better."
2.0,"I have an 18 gauge piercing in my nose, and this did not fit at all. Tried all three kinds. Really cheap."
2.0,"TOO SMALL, EVEN THOUGH ITS MY SIZE- L"
2.0,Turn colors fast
2.0,Adorable but it broke the 1st time my daughter wore it. I would not recommend if you are doing anything active.
2.0,I wear a large ordered xl did not fit so I ordered 2xl still did not fit not sure why
2.0,"Ordered a bigger size and it was still too small, material is very thin."
2.0,"I don't like giving bad reviews. But for me, I really didn't like these earring. They were way too big, needed for my taste about 1/2 the diameter and way too heavy, they pulled my ear lopes down and I had them on about 2 minutes."
2.0,I dislike the handles continuing to break.
2.0,"As cute as these earrings are, its a shame that they fell apart before I could truly enjoy them. The clips were comfy, But the construction of them needs rethinking. The fabric loop that they are attached to the metal clip seemed like it was sharp and cut the threads. We were on a drive over the weekend and we stopped to stretch our legs and I noticed the earring was laying on my shoulder. I went to put it back on and saw it was cut and frazzled. Maybe if they had strung it on a metal Jump ring and attached to the metal clip, There was no way to reattach without a major remaking of the fabric loop."
2.0,I cannot believe how much it cost to get these shipped for my 85 year old dad!
2.0,It seemed like a great product. It fell apart after two uses.
2.0,Smaller than described would fit a preteen maybe younger
2.0,Came with a weird scratch and other scratches as well as a fingerprint. Disappointed because other wise it’s cute.
2.0,Fabric is low quality. Stitching is poor. Some lining and sowing came apart before 1st use
2.0,"For $11.88, these are pricey pieces of plastic. TBH, it's more like a dollar store craft pieces. It looked better in pictures and some pieces are missing wings - the broken piece is not even inside the box it came with. No quality control whatsoever. Returning."
2.0,takes me and my wife both to get them on
2.0,"The steel color change is all on the sides and back, so when the belly ring is in my stomach, it just looks shiny pink. You have to lift it or turn it sideways to even see another color."
2.0,Only lasted one trip. The longer strapped actually ripped off before arriving at my destination. This is not a travel bag. Maybe an overnight bag.
2.0,"Material is nice. Quite flowy. True navy color. The fit (size S) however is pure maternity wear. There's just too much material  and yet, when you bend you're legitimately concerned abut exposing your backside. Fit across the bust (34c) was fine but comes up a little high under the arms (not uncomfortably) but as a function of the strap length.  Iif there was a way to adjust the straps to make them a bit longer, I think that would have solved the neckline and fit under the arms. Lots of static cling with this dress is also not attractive."
2.0,"Wrinkles very easily; hard to get it to sit right... if you have a decent sized chest, you will see this laying under your shirt and it is likely to ride up . I think it would work fine for a smaller-chested person where the front fabric could not sit so high."
2.0,I'm a true XL shirt gal. the recommendation size was only large but I don't like tight clothes so I always get xlarge irregardless.  There's 0 chance this is an XL! My husband wears a large and it was even tight on him. It was super disappointing cause I love the color and design!
2.0,"Cheaply made, hole in shoulcer area sits weird. Wasn't as long as expected."
2.0,These were huge!<br />I think I saw someone compare to Lululemon these are nothing like Lululemon spandex shorts. Had to return and wasn't too interested in sizing down because those probably would be too large as well
2.0,"Runs large.  Once I saw in person, I decided it wasn't for me.  In the process of returning."
2.0,"Super cute ring, but NOT a size 8."
2.0,The color is not at all what the pic showed!!!
2.0,"These shirts run extremely small, I wear an xl on a regular basis and I couldn't even get these over my arms"
2.0,The material is super thin and has a strange sort of rough sponge feel - it’s very stiff. The print and stitching is super low quality. I doubt this material will survive a single wash. The cord to the hood is very short and completely frayed/unfinished on both ends.
2.0,"I didn't really like the fit, it was a bit awkward and the color was completely different than what is shown."
2.0,Marginal quality of fabric and 2 sizes too small.I am a size 14/16 and the XL fit like a meduim.
2.0,Jacket was not heavy or warm like it was advertised and size were small.
2.0,appears too short in the back of the shirt. Long in front but significantly shorter in back that made it necessary to return.
2.0,"My daughter had it out of the package for about 5 minutes before the &#34;leather&#34; pulled out of the clasp. She is 11, and very careful with her jewelry.  I was able to super glue it back into the clasp.  The next day, the pendant fell off.  She doesn't want me to return it, because she loves the horse pendant, so we are going to look for a better quality chain."
2.0,This ring is just ok for me. Looks cheap due to the metal color. I would not buy this again.
2.0,"Its very thin, see through and youd have to be pretty flat chested to wear it :/"
2.0,It broke ten minuyes after putting it on. Two of the four strands pulled out of the clasp. The clasp does not lock very well. It must be too small for an average size man. I like the look and may try to fix it. I have not decided yet.
2.0,I received two of these.  The first pair broke and they replaced it quickly :). The second pair also broke.  I would not recommend this product.
2.0,Seems like they are made of cardboard. Was expecting a little better than that. Very cheesy. But shipping was fast.
2.0,Earrings felt apart after being put on for the first time.  Ring stone fell out.  Necklace and bracelt ok.
2.0,The coat was way too small. It was shopped from China so I had no way to return it and had to give it to a friend.
2.0,"I guess the case itself is waterproof, but it did not keep the contents dry while at the beach. Nothing was damaged, but it was disappointing to find the few bills (folded in thirds to fit) and my ID soaking wet. The clasp closed without a problem so I don't think there was an issue with anything keeping it from closing as designed."
2.0,Super cute looking but horribly made. Already had strings coming off them straight out of the package. Only lasted like 2 weeks before falling apart.<br /><br />You get what you pay for.
2.0,Great fit but very itchy
2.0,The inner facing is done cheaply and will be a problem when washing. Bigger size than expected
2.0,The ball falls off very easy. Disappointed. I'm glad I only needed one barbell.
2.0,"Would fit a very slim10 year old, but very pretty color."
2.0,"Unfortunately these gloves have large, tacky labels on the upward facing sides of both gloves which do not appear in the photos on Amazon."
2.0,these appeared larger online than they are in life. for the cost I did not think they are worth it. i sent these back to seller.
2.0,"I love the bright, cheerful colors of these socks, but I was disappointed that they were not more cushioned.<br />I wear size 8 wide, but these socks feel a bit small and skimpy. They slip off my feet when I'm in bed, which is annoying."
2.0,"My son wears a 3XLT. Ordered 5X and its doest fit through the shoulders, the arms are too short and zipper won't meet in the front."
2.0,Fit was way smaller than stated. Returned.
2.0,I ordered 1x. This dress is more like a medium.
2.0,Doesn't stay in my nose which is a bummer because it's pretty.
2.0,Love this but it broke in two days need better chain
2.0,Way too short.  Barely covered my butt and I didn’t like that.
2.0,Broke after just a few days. Very cheaply made.
2.0,"the filter it's not really comfortable, sunlight pass the glasses. Lateral plastic frames are low quality."
2.0,The stars this earned was because of how early it came but it came broken soo yea
2.0,"I recently the product for my patio to avoid the sun and rain. It does great with deflecting the sun and stops a little bit of rain, but once the umbrella is saturated/if its raining medium or more, it will outright come through the fabric. If you stand under the umbrella in the rain you will feel little flicks of water (not full blown droplets due to the weave). All of the metal pieces framing the umbrella will get soaked and so will any furniture you have under it, as if it was out in the open. So, keep that in mind with your purchase. The metal frame is powder coated but I will be very surprised if this doesn't rust/wear out the mechanical parts more quickly as they get soaked. In the traditional sense of the word ""umbrella"" you would assume this is water PROOF or even resistant.. this is barely resistant. I'd say it ""deflects"" water, maybe 85-90% of it, but it still comes through. You feel water hitting you standing under it. I couldn't find anything about water resistance in the description, so I won't knock the product too hard. That said, I think most people would agree umbrellas are there to stop water- this one DOES NOT STOP WATER and I would really classify it as a sunshade."
2.0,ive ordered colortone sweat shirts before that were great. this one was very thin snd poor quality
2.0,size description is incorrect and it was much smaller than I anticipated
2.0,"Not sure if we just got a bad one - otherwise it looked great, worked well, until the pole just snapped - 2 weeks old. But I have to say I was impressed with the handling of the situation. Complete refund - I sent photos of where it snapped. They did not have my color in stock or I may have tried it again."
2.0,Cut much smaller than the listed tag.....
2.0,The dress fits ok but it is shorter than I expected.
2.0,they fog up quickly
2.0,"The band material is great. Pliable, strong, comfortable to wear. The buckle, however, is not so good. Not solid stainless steel though it appears like it. It’s actually a lightweight kind of pot metal made to look like like stainless steel. If you’ve ever had a buckle tongue break on a plastic digital watch strap you know what happens next - watch on the floor. Other straps for not much more have solid stainless steel buckles."
2.0,I ordered these to wear for a wedding.  They arrived missing stones (in each earring) and were extremely heavy.  The seller offered to send another pair but I would rather have my money back to purchase other earrings.  I was expecting better quality and am returning them.
2.0,Very disappointed. 15/20 of the ones I got were pink. I know it said &#34;random&#34; but I was hoping for a bit of a better selection.
2.0,Wore once and washed the product that the lace fell apart.
2.0,"This dress is completely see through, heads up. It also fits weird in the chest if you aren’t well endowed. I’m going to have to make some modifications to get fit right."
2.0,Color drab.  Fabric rough.
2.0,"The bag was really cute and loved the washable fabric. However, was just too big to be a tote. They should advertise it as a weekender bag. If it was just 3 inches smalerl in length. and 1 inch shorter in height. Would of been perfect. The bag was just too large for daily tote use."
2.0,Bigger at the waist than expected.
2.0,I like these leggings but I haven't had them for long and they are starting to pill in the crotch area. I wouldn't buy them again.
2.0,Very thin material. Otherwise it fits as expected.
2.0,"I was first most upset that I paid to have the dress expedited and I received almost a week late and almost arrive on the date of regular shipping. The dress, beside it being long, the bottom was so much fabric that it did not show my leg. It was as if it was a full skirt. The top was big and hard to get right with pulling the lace."
2.0,Cut small. Order larger size
2.0,Returned. Much too small.
2.0,Product doesn’t look like item in the picture. The style is for older females.
2.0,The picture is of a different sweater. I ordered khaki and it was a pale yellow color. Boxy fitting. soft but they should post pictures of the actual sweater
2.0,"It wasn’t at all what I expected. Kind of repulsive, wouldn’t recommend lol"
2.0,way too low waisted
2.0,Quality isn’t bad but it is very uncomfortable to wear.
2.0,"I like the concept of having a “sponge” attached to the gloves, however, after using them for the second time, I noticed that my fingers would get wet after I removed the gloves.<br />I would like to return the gloves or is there a way I could get a replacement? Thank you."
2.0,The metal has pits in it. Not worth the money or time waited to receive the item.
2.0,"It tarnishes in less than a month, cant expect much for $8"
2.0,This product says it's not supposed irritate your ears. By the second time I wore them my ears got all red and inflamed and hurt. I'm allergic to the coating that they put on the fake earrings and I thought they would be different because I was looking for a pair of stud earrings to wear.
2.0,"This product, turned colors, faded"
2.0,These are very light weight and cheap feeling. I put them in and immediately noticed the posts are way too long so we snipped them. Then I noticed my ears burning and were red. I went ahead and kept them in but about 24 hrs later I couldn’t take it anymore and took them out. Immediate relief and I’m not allergic to anything. waste of money
2.0,Do not fit comfortably and do not look so nice on.
2.0,"The pajamas are cute, but not well made. One pair came with a huge hole down the seam of the shirt"
2.0,These run very small.  Buy a size up.  Maybe two sizes up.
2.0,"There is no beige. It's replaced with pink, but the images are all misleading. Beige is not a color option. If you needed beige as I did, then purchase elsewhere."
2.0,"Love this top! RUNS VERY SMALL! I am a size 10 and my bust measures 42"". I ordered X-Large and it fits correctly. SansoiSan's size chart says that I should wear/purchase a size SMALL! Small would never have fit! I ORDERED UP 3 sizes for the correct fit...So, I suggest, ORDER UP ladies!!! I would have given 5 stars, but I wanted to let everyone know about the size chart reality...:)"
2.0,Use only on heavy necklaces otherwise necklace choke you
2.0,Love Kendra Scott but this bracelet is tiny and made for small boned people.  It looked like a kid's bracelet on my wrist and I'm average sized.
2.0,I bought these pants for work but was super disappointed to find that these pants are not only huge  but definitely not ankle length/ cropped as advertised. For the price I expected it to be exactly what is advertised and also made out of a higher quality material. Disappointing.
2.0,"I never wore it, it looks like the material will come out. Not good quality.."
2.0,Top area small for large boobs. Pool area worthy is it
2.0,This had the potential to be the best costume. High in price for the orang piece to keep coming undone and making the costume deflate. I had a crying child on Halloween.
2.0,"No me gustó, queda muy ceñido en la parte de abajo, además se sube bastante cuando camino"
2.0,The tissue is of very poor quality and indeed quite flammable! I do not recommend this product as it is quite dangerous and of poor quality
2.0,I didn't like how much material is digging into my stomach.
2.0,"The costume was not comfortable for my son although it was his size. The problem is it is very tight at the arms and at the legs making it so difficult to put it on, my son only wore it once and then didn’t want it to try again. I recommend to work on thr sleeves and the legs. I returned the product"
2.0,"The product arrived however the way it was packaged, the shield has wrinkles that I can not get out. I tried soaking it in hot water but that didn't work. Still trying to figure out how I can smooth it out. The wrinkles distort  what you see through the shield which makes it uncomfortable to wear."
2.0,Material was very thin. You can see through it.
2.0,"Ordered a size up and still too tight in the chest and arms.  Looked great, but did not fit.  I gave it away!!!!!"
2.0,I ordered XL and they were too tight to wear. I'm a pretty thin guy and the waist was off by about 2 inches.
2.0,way too small. I'm 5'2 105 lbs and ordered the small.
2.0,The dress was coming apart at the seam.  I had to order another one.  Hopefully I just got a bad one
2.0,Doesn't fit as shown.  It's a bit large and looks cheap.
2.0,"Hello, I purchased 2 caps and I love the caps however the black cap on the embroidered part is stained like a dark grey. It is light colored in the photo online. It isn't ask described. Can someone please contact me I would like another sent but not an option on site. Thank you"
2.0,Did not like the shiny fabric. Way more pink than in photo-Sent it back. If you like shiny pink you will love this!
2.0,If you have alotta hair or not an average size head for a little person then you won't like it....
2.0,"To loss on the ankles and calves, just right on the thighs and there is no elastic band on the waist. Too tight."
2.0,"I didn't research this as I do most things, so I didn't notice what the flannel material was. It's quite cheap, however it works for Florida winter weather. I do like it, mostly because I love flannel and a good elbow patch."
2.0,I love these pants. They fit loose not tight like leggings but not too loose. Since I’m in a wheelchair that comfort is critical.
2.0,Not even pairs. Delivered unorganized and all in the same bag. Dirty. Eh.
2.0,"I really like this band, I just wish the button fasteners didn't rust on my skin. I already can't use it."
2.0,"I’ve always loved this style tank, and I like these striped pattern options. But be aware of these stripe, the medium is perfect for me. However, the stripes DO NOT stretch like the primary fabric in the tank, therefore the medium felt like a extra small.<br /><br />The stripe had no flex at all. While the rest of the tank did. I also bought 6 others in solid colors ( no stripe) also medium and they fit perfect even after wash, but the stripe is what doesn’t work on the tank. I’m so glad I only bought one stripe to try first.<br /><br />I gave it a 2 star due to it being the nice style tank I like, but the stripe not flexing through it all off."
2.0,They Slide off your arm after using them twice.
2.0,I bought this to add to my 17 year old son's wallet. He kept losing it while playing basketball and football with his friends. The first chain broke near the clasp within 2 days of opening package. Exchange was easy and painless. Second chain broke as well and it’s too late to replace. DO NOT PURCHASE THIS CHAIN
2.0,"The pants are too small , they are nothing like the pictures that are displayed , the only picture that they kind of look like are the second picture of the girl standing in a black bikini top with her legs closed. They are more like tapered pants , instead of loose fitted beach bottoms. the material is also very clingy but I think maybe if they get steamed it could be ok , I might return them just because of the fit."
2.0,"Not for me. If you are looking for something to wear as part of a costume, have at it, but this is not something that looks appropriate for a professional office. Maybe my torso exceptionally long, but the way this buttoned in the front and how high up it came was laughable. The material was really the biggest issue though, it actually looks like costume material. Unfortunate."
2.0,"The shorts fit great. A little sheer, but I would’ve made it work. My issue was that the neckline looked nothing like what was advertised. I’m typically a small and got a medium hoping it would be a little more loose."
2.0,Love the style of the watch but it quit running a week after I received it. Not happy
2.0,May I should have purchased a size bigger.
2.0,Seems like decent quality but not sized correctly.  I know they’re meant to fit snug but it’s about 3 sizes smaller than normal.
2.0,Poor quality. Never wore it. Belt is cheaply made.
2.0,too small and too flimsy
2.0,Long in the trunk
2.0,"The material is not a jersey type-spandex material. It is really thin spandex only, see through, and not very flattering."
2.0,"Immediately noticed the 2 inch hole and run in the seam under the keyhole opening before I opened the bag. Otherwise, cheap 100% scratchy polyester, giving two stars instead of one because my grandma has a serger to hopefully mend it and I don't have the patience to deal with returning it. (Massive eye roll) Not worth $25"
2.0,"The color of this dress is great. The fabric not so much. It’s stiff, rough, and scratchy."
2.0,I don't like these shorts at all primarily due to the fact the waistband is too tight and narrow. It doesn't sit on the hips like yoga pants or even sweat pants. Unless you have a super flat stomach this will give you bulges and muffin top even with the right size. Not exactly a look one would hope for when going for a bike ride. The padding is somewhat wide and it does feel dipper-y when worn. Overall length seems ok but there are better fitting bike shorts out-there. I would not recommend this one.
2.0,"Lovely color and I wish I could have a better review, but I can't because I had a very difficult time even getting these stockings on and even more difficulty getting them off; in fact, I started to  panic because I could not get them off and considered having to cut them.  I finally managed to get them off but indeed, these are too restricting for me."
2.0,the earrings are tiny hearts. in the picture they look larger. I am a returning buyer because I was happy with my other purchases from this seller but I am disappointed in this product.
2.0,The shirts shrank after one wash. Not a good buy
2.0,"This product was a bit larger than I expected.  Luckily, it was pretty cheap."
2.0,Size is way below what fit should be. Will be returning.
2.0,Did not care for the material of this top at all! I was expecting a “silk” like material but instead is a cotton stretchy material...looks cheap.
2.0,Fabric is a rather slick material and not very sturdy.  Wrinkles easily
2.0,"Put my keys on it (one car one home, and a few pad lock keys) this thing broke in a few days. More mass produced crap from China. Dont waste your money here"
2.0,"I was looking for some pods in which to carry clothing such as jeans, shirts, sweaters etc. If I were a shrimp the items I received just might be appropriate for me but their size is really only good for small items - underwear, socks etc. Where am I supposed to put the larger stuff ?"
2.0,"I purchased this a while back, but had to quickly replace it as the battery compartment corroded and made the vest useless.  The reflective bands are highly reflective and the fit is good, but really bought it for the LED lights."
2.0,"This looked cute on the model but when I put it on it felt very grandma-ish. 2 stars because it came as expected, just didn't realize it wouldn't flatter me at all."
2.0,"Bought earrings to match a ring and tiara.  I wanted to match so I disregarded others’ warnings the earrings are heavy.  Through experience, I can now say I should have listened.  The combination is very nice, but the earrings are heavy.  I suffered through the night with them on because it was the look I was going for, and “beauty is pain”.  However, when I took them off for the night my earlobes were very sore because of the weight.  I love the earrings, but the weight of them caused me good deal of pain."
2.0,2 different sizes...huh ?
2.0,Felt like I was wearing a newspaper as a dress. So uncomfortable.  The color was nice.
2.0,This clips of one of teh earring was already broken when i got it and it wouldnt stay put
2.0,Ordered black.  Got dark brown.  Not worth the hassle to return.  Disappointed.
2.0,They were perfect until I washed them. They still fit but very short now
2.0,Mot fitting well.
2.0,Wish it brought the lanyard strap as showed online
2.0,Very cheap. I only wear the black pair. I would not recommend.
2.0,These shorts are made for bony or really thin people. If you're muscular do not buy.
2.0,This thing is enormous! And long!! It drags on the floor. I don't like it. It is a pretty color.
2.0,"I liked the fit, and the size was good, but the material was too thin and you could see through it when I was wearing it."
2.0,Wasn't what I thought it was & the item is very fragile.
2.0,Beautiful anklet but too hard to size it the clasp is hard to open
2.0,"When these first came I was so happy with quality. I was showing them of to friends and co-workers,, they really look good.... But a few days later the red started to peel off...  That really sucks because of the look of them people ask to see them. Now that's a no go. See picture attached."
2.0,Love that it’s hair resistant but material is crap ripped within a week
2.0,The fit was way to small .. it was a disappointment. The material was soft.
2.0,The band itself is fine - the problem is that it will NOT fit my Samsung Gear S2 Classic because of the shell construction on the ends.  Hard to explain but this band will be limited to only a few watches it will fit.  The watch stalks the the band attaches to on the watch will have to be long to allow the pins to reach.
2.0,"The embroiled tesla logo is uneven (the orange didn’t cover the T on the right side) so when I have it on, it looks funny. Actually ordered a replacement because I like the hat... hopefully it’ll come right.<br />Will update review after getting the new one"
2.0,"Not crazy about it. Just a simple, very casual summer beach dress."
2.0,The zipper is all messed up on this jumper
2.0,It is 2D not 3D. It is flat not real feathers. But from far away I guess they're okay and perfect size.
2.0,This was a gift and unfortuneatley it was broken.
2.0,Quality is not good. Sleeves are bulky and are not proportionally matching.  Overall it is not awful but I expected better according to the pictures.
2.0,"I have been wearing Crocs for a few years now and I wear them everyday, as I live where the climate it hot year around.  My old ones were worn out and I decided to purchase a more 'dressy' style of sandal.  I ordered these, tried them on to be sure they fit, which they did and brought them overseas with me a few weeks later.  I had wore them for only 2 days around my apartment and all of a sudden as I was walking, the stitching at the toe separator and the strap across my foot came undone.  Couldn't believe it.  Since I won't be returning to the U.S. for 2-1/2 months, I can't return them.  I'll have to pay a shoe repair place to re-stitch.  Not happy at all."
2.0,"They survived only one roundtrip. after that, they broke and fall apart."
2.0,"Too thin, lacks shape, odd fabric"
2.0,Lighter than expected kinda feels like a toy
2.0,little small.  Order it one size larger
2.0,Looks funny.. Clown like. But for the price I guess it's an okay top!
2.0,Cute but very very very small
2.0,"I bought this in a size large and it took about 2.5 weeks to show up. Its cute enough but the neck is literally so oddly cut that I couldn't figure which way was the front and which was the back. Also because of how it was cut, it hit my neck in an odd way and felt really uncomfortable and tight, so much so that I spent the rest of the day pulling at it trying to not feel choked. There are no tags for reference, and there is a weird seam that runs in the middle of one side of the dress. I figured that the seam went in the back, but after getting to work and being choked the whole way there, my co-workers and I decided that the seam must go up the front. The picture shows a dress that is pitch black, but when this showed up it looked more like a black that had been washed several times and faded to that weird bluish/black.The picture also shows a dress that appears to be textured, which is part of what I liked so much, but it is strictly the look of the picture and not the actual fabric of the dress that showed up. This dress has so much potential, but the weird seam that runs up the dress and the really uncomfortable neck opening, make me wish that I could send it back."
2.0,One was broken when I got them which is a shame because they are beautiful and comfortable.
2.0,"***not real corduroy*** cheep material, very sad.  It’s more of a rough cotton"
2.0,"these shirts my wife ordered, she was displeased. The sizing is about a size lower than it's true size. So size Large is more like a size medium. On top of that when washing they faded."
2.0,The symbol is blurry and not even really there.
2.0,"I bought a black and brown belt in January 2013.  They do the job, but the buckle is very cheap looking.  Also after about a month of wear the belts started to ""crack"" where you insert the buckle."
2.0,These were teeny tiny! I couldn't even get them past my legs.
2.0,Tried to order i size larger then I needed and it is still small need something that will fit a working man’s wrist
2.0,"Very big and keeps going down, won’t buy again"
2.0,"These belts are very small , even if they have stretch."
2.0,"It fits, but it does not fit right. It certainly is not flattering for plus curves."
2.0,This is my third quadrone pro I have gotten. returned the other 2. After about 2 weeks of flying one of the motors stops working or the camera wont work. The quad flys great and easy to handle but half the time the camera wont work or the motors wont work right.
2.0,"Style and colors are great but this thing sheds off pieces of material like nothing I’ve ever seen. My floor was covered in small black fabric pieces when I took it out of the bag and when I wore it, it was all over my clothing. I’m positive if I ever tried to wash it, it would just disintegrate in my machine."
2.0,"Looks funny, but really hard to see through. Also hard to breathe, and gets hot really quick."
2.0,"It was the length of a cardigan. However, I’ll wear it over a cami and shorts."
2.0,Shorter than it looks
2.0,"Beautiful shoes, however the sizing is off. The shoes are so narrow, it's as if they made the shoe longer for a larger size, but did not widen the shoe in proportion."
2.0,"Well I love the charms but I only got 135. So that's definitely a bit of false advertising 😢. I really love the charms. And I would have even bought another pack but this is unacceptable. It is,not to mention,exactly one quarter of the charms that are missing. I find that a bit odd. I feel a bit ripped off."
2.0,Bought a size bigger than I normally wear and it's still too small
2.0,"Since the dawn of the era of clothes made in China, sizes are no longer what they used to be, ranging from somewhat smaller to rididulously smaller. For those who live far from department stores, internet shopping becomes a quessing game subject to luck. Vanity Fair, take heed and continue to supply your quality undergarments in sizes made for Western women. Western women, a size 7 now is more like an 8 of days gone by."
2.0,The color was beautiful. It was a frumpy stretchy mess of a T-shirt and too thin. Didn't send back. Gave away.
2.0,(For tongue) Really liked it but colour came off after a couple of weeks so quite disappointing :-( and it's not the greatest of things as it's for inside the mouth! Went back to steel and that's all!
2.0,"I like this nose ring, except that the stud sticks out too far from my nose skin because the ring is too long..."
2.0,Looks beautiful but it seems like it is not leather but plastic inside
2.0,The strings in the back broke on me after one week of wearing it twice and washing once.
2.0,"I gave it 2 stars for the cute factor. But it is extremely TOO small to fit our faces. Then when you do manage to put it on,  your ears hurt and you can barely breathe."
2.0,It's exactly what it looks like however the necklace is sterling silver but the pendant is not. Wasn't happy at all about that but it's still adorable and she's gonna love it.
2.0,We should buy 2 sizes bigger because it doesn't fit my daughter.
2.0,Very uncomfortable and not a great design keeps digging into my nose and making large scratches
2.0,Bought this for a maternity shoot. Made me look like an elephant. Returned quickly. It is also very sheer.
2.0,Not worth 35 dollars. If you're looking for glasses that look like Wood skip these the paint makes it look like plastic
2.0,"Bought this hat for my 1 year old, since the description says it can fit a 1 year old, and it's HUGE. My 5 year old wears it now."
2.0,Cute but cheaply made. Looks like a Halloween costume.
2.0,They are pretty cheaply made and extremely huge ... I like big glasses but these cover half my face
2.0,Gold chains looked cheap.
2.0,"Material of the shirt is very rough and cheap, I ended up sending it back. I would not recommend."
2.0,These make your crotch sweat & the leg holes are too tight.
2.0,"Had to return. It runs small & the picture online made it look aqua, but it’s definitely a green dress. The fabric was scratchy, not flowy like in the picture."
2.0,This seems to run small. I wish I would have gotten a size up. Also the material seemed to have no stretch in it like other sweatshirts. It was not comfortable and took it off right after I put it on.
2.0,"Material feels amazing. The top fits beautifully but not without a sleep bra... y’all busty girls know.. These shorts though. What on earth? They are hot pants. If you have a booty and want it at least partially covered, these are not the jammies for you. They “fit” but.. more like undies."
2.0,Poor quality. Received with many loose threads and issues with the stitching on the pocket.
2.0,We haven't been able to use it. Too tight for my baby or me. Don't recomend for an infant
2.0,"When i recieved my glasses i was very pleased they looked great, they fit well and i could see great but i only had them for 2-3 days before one of the nose gaurds broke off! Im very saddened by the fact that they broke so quickly. I can't even return them because the nearest ups store is unable to scan the bar code do they want me to get a ride 20 miles away to return them or pay the return shipping myself which is a ridiculous 18$"
2.0,The snaps which hold the watch do not stay connected
2.0,Love the design of the earrings which I why I gave it 2 stars. The earrings are poorly constructed. The hooks on the earrings need to be tightened so you won’t lose them. The earrings do not come with the backs to help keep them in your ears.
2.0,Wasn't happy didn't fit as expected.
2.0,I have a small wrist.  Too big but loved it
2.0,I fell in love with this nose stud but I should’ve listened to the reviews. It is so tiny that it cannot be appreciated because it’s hard to see.<br />If it was at least 6mm - 7mm it would be perfect.<br />Note to seller: please make this bigger & I would definitely re order
2.0,The dress was too sheer.  Could see right through it.  Poor quality material in my opinion.
2.0,Eh. It wasn't as cute as expected. Returned.
2.0,"The red color looks NOTHING like the photo. the photo looks like a merlot red, what i got... is cherry cherry bright christmas red.  Not attractive."
2.0,"Received it today, the engraving is very tiny, cant see it unless turn it to side.  I got it because I lost my beloved Chihuahua and the words on this pendant are beautiful.  They describe exactly how I feel.  I know the seller said that the pendant is only 7/8 inches but the way they showed the engraving I somehow thought it would be more legible it is not and too bad.  The paw next to the pendant is very cute however.<br />The chain is 20 inches with the extender, so when you fold it to wear it is only 10 inches.  I will wear it for sure as I am heart broken.  The metal of this pendant is who knows what, it is some inexpensive metal you can tell so for $24.00 with shipping I guess I will keep it, not worth the trouble to return it.<br />I do not recommend it however, because it is nothing to look at.  Looks better on screen, and I fell for it after reading the inscription.<br />Edited 7/6/17, just to let you know that yesterday I took the pendant off the chain because it turned black on the back and the chain turned also.  I attached this pendant face up with the words facing on my dogs cremation urn.  The words are the only thing that is good on this pendant.  Waste of my money."
2.0,"Loved these for the first two weeks of owning them. By the third week, the left one was coming apart at the footbed. Very disappointed. See attached pics. Fortunately I'm still within the time I'm able to return these."
2.0,"Medium in size at best, if not slightly smaller than your average sunglasses. I was really disappointed with how small and flimsy these are, although for $12, what did I expect?"
2.0,It’s very see through and sheer. Makes it seem very cheap.
2.0,"The pockets, though great, do not lie flat and make the fabric stick out of the sides more than expected giving my hips a weird look to them. I'm also 5'3"" and it dress comes down to my ankles in the back which isn't the length it appears on the models or what I was expected. Pattern and fabric are otherwise nice."
2.0,"My girlfriend ordered them for Christmas, but she didn't receive them until mid January.  I liked them at first, but they are not high quality.  I wore them for about 2 weeks until they cracked when I bent over to tie my shoe and they fell off my face.  They cracked on the top rim and the lens would not longer fit.<br /><br />I had better luck with dollar store sunglasses.  Sorry."
2.0,"I received this hat today.  My wife laughs at me saying that I have more hats than she has shoes.  I absolutely love hats.  For my favorite hats, I will sometimes buy two, so I can wear one out, and know I have another.  This is to say that I was really looking forward to this one and was disappointed when I got it and put it on.<br /><br />Pros<br />- I looks great<br />- It has a Velcro enclosure<br />- the bill of the hat is very sturdy, with nice edging around the bill<br />- the camo design is nice<br />- The stitching on the front and the side Navy seals is nice<br /><br />Cons<br />- It is made in China<br />- Its tag says 100% acrylic<br />- The front two panels of the dome of the hat is study in front, with the main seal, but the back four panels are very light weight, flimsy even<br />- When I hold the bill of the hat, the material is such that the back of the hat slumps down<br />- It is not the sturdy material and stitching of the hats I had when in the Navy or any of the other hats I would purchase if I picked it up off a shelf<br />- While the hat has a Velcro closure, it is as flimsy, like the back of the hat<br />- With my other hats, the dome of the hat is taller, when I push the metal tab on top, there is about an inch of air above... With this hat, with the correct Velcro set, there is almost no room at the top of my hat.<br /><br />Final... That hat looks great, but, to me, seems to have cut corners to save some dollars.  I have another Navy camo hat I found out of the Washington/Dulles hat of al places, made in the US, very study material and Velcro closure.  Next time I went back through, I stopped by the same store and purchased another one.<br /><br />Honestly, If I was in a store, I would have been drawn to this hat.  I would have picked it up, seen the flimsy material and probably not even tried it on, that if I had, the shallowness of the hat would have had me put it back on the shelf and look for another one.  I would return it, but it is just not worth the effort.  I may become something I use in the garage or when mowing a lawn, something that can get messy and then get thrown away."
2.0,"The presentation was great. Very nice velvet storage bag with store name and logo on it. The earrings were sub standard for what I was expecting however. This was not a true white gold, perhaps because of the low carat. They appear more of a stainless steal. For this reason I returned them. Also the back of the earring is ridiculously small. I’m talking baby earring backs are larger. I am concerned about them perforating the earring hole and making it larger. The small size of the backs make it very difficult to manage as well. I ordered the 8mm size, so the backs were not relatable to the earring at all. I advise go to Sams club.  I truly can’t understand such great reviews from so many."
2.0,I ordered a bigger size then i normally wear and it was still extremely small
2.0,The size seems too big for a keychain and the print is inverted which is sad to see.
2.0,My son loved this backpack until the zipper track broke after only 2 months of use. Really disappointing.
2.0,Fits really odd. Too short but it hangs too low in the front.
2.0,"Very uncomfortable fit, also when working out. I thought I ripped them mid-squat. Not flattering, tummy control is very little. Do not recommend. Come to find out, they did slightly tear😒 after ONE lifting session."
2.0,Didn't like material and was not true to size
2.0,The top had ties that  were to slippery and I thought the top would fall off<br />The bottoms where to high cut especially in the crotch area and it showed pubic hair.<br />I sent it back
2.0,Backpack description says is for men or kids but it is very small even for my six-year-old!
2.0,Received the wrong big :(
2.0,ordered a extra large when i got it i could not pull the jacket over my head very disapointed
2.0,The Velcro is no longer sticking I’m thinking of removing the old Velcro and replacing with new but is it worth the hassle? Would not recommend these for active toddlers
2.0,"Its okay.....the metal isn't very shiny and the quality is marginal.....when you move the &#34;rope&#34; seperates and your shirt material/hair etc get caught....its not tightly wound at all. When its hanging it looks okay, I just expected it to be a little more shiney and more tightly wound. Its not a true &#34;rope&#34; or twisted/braided chain, its just a bunch of ovals put together so it has the appearance of a rope....also it is far thinner than I imagined....is this really 4mm? In hindsight, I wish i found something thicker with a little better quality - even if i had to pay more for it. It has the quality of something out of a gumball machine."
2.0,thought it would be stretchier
2.0,"I'm an 8.5 or 9 size shoe so, I admit I was pushing it on these - but, I mean - they're SOCKS! After wearing them once, the big toe area is already fraying / running. So, I probably wouldn't buy them again. Maybe you'll have better luck if your feet are smaller. The grippie on the heel is good and they stay in place, which is nice."
2.0,Once again sizes are not what you expect.  Returned it immediately.
2.0,Band changed colors
2.0,The material is super cheap. The one shoulder isnt even stitched to the body of the dress. The straps are extremely long and leave the top of the dress exposing my DD chest. If I choose to shorten them the dress would be to short and would be considered a top. Not happy with the quality of work.
2.0,"This shorts  way too small, I ordered large cuz I read some reviews and I am usually a medium. The shorts wont even go up my thighs."
2.0,"Literally just received this today and it broke the moment I tried to put it on,  the piece that locks the bracelet in fell off... You really get what you pay for.... I will say the bracelet is super cute."
2.0,After removing the item from the package and trying to put them on one of the ear pieces came apart. Immediately returned them to seller.
2.0,This ring is not sterling silver. The finish is coming off already. Would never buy again.
2.0,"So I bought an xl it was very cute and fit in most places, but wasn’t floor length like the picture. I’m pretty disappointed because I wanted to wear this dress for my maternity pictures and now have to find another dress."
2.0,The pants are very light weight and extremely long.  I am 5’5 and before I could wear them I had to take off about a foot of extra material because the are way too long for the average person.  Overall the quality of this product was not good.
2.0,"Seems like it would be a good product, if I could fit in them.  I would typically wear a 42 in wrangler, lee, or lucky brands.  The 4xl is maybe a 40.  True to fit does not describe this products size"
2.0,"Super cute, seems well made. Two sizes too small. Disappointing they don't have a bigger size of the red polka dot one available. Will be returning."
2.0,I like the style of it but it’s so poorly made using the cheapest fabric!  It’s scratchy on and after a week my zipper already ripped.  Don’t waste your money!!
2.0,The color was darker than the picture.  I do not care for the feel of the material this sweater is made of.  It also has a very strong chemical smell.
2.0,"I love Avis, I was looking for a heavy weight that is more slick that repels cat hair and fuzz and such. The description was incorrect. They are light weight, that are more cotton so they are picking up all kinds of lint and for a small they are running big.. not impressed with the weight of the leggings either"
2.0,"Very large, not what I expected"
2.0,Band is light weigh and nice looking but used it for exactly one day before it was put in a drawer.  The magnet closure is terrible I had to readjust the band at least 3 times every hour due to it becoming loose.
2.0,"They are wearable, but unfortunately they are shaped like gloves and not socks. There is no heel built in. So you end up short socked in the back, or worse the sock digs in between your toes and it hurts. I'm just not sure how they thought this pattern was for feet."
2.0,I don’t like why it’s being fired
2.0,What do U want to hear?  It's just skimpy and requires adjusting under all the sweaters I own (size 10 US).
2.0,The product is not as good as shown.
2.0,Was kinda see through
2.0,Quality was decent but was to tight on my head. Returned
2.0,"These earrings are tiny.  I thought they fan over my earlobe but they are too small.  They are pretty and good quality, but I was wanting a bigger earring.  I received these earrings at a discount or for free for my unbiased opinion."
2.0,"I bought these pants with the intent of wearing them over my clothes.  However, they will not fit over boots and I have to take them off before I can put on or remove the pants, very inconvenient.  The pants are difficult to walk in and ride too high up the leg when seated on a motorcycle. They do seem to be very tough and offer good protection, however I would not buy them again.."
2.0,"Don't waste your money. One time in the pool and the chlorine is already breaking down the fabric. I washed them, gentle cycle after swimming in them and the whole rear end fabric is breaking down. Whomever did the sewing of the mesh on the inside doesn't know how to sew, the outside would stretch one way and mesh on the inside wouldn't move with it."
2.0,I feel like little Chinese children stitch these shorts and they the fabric was from their bed sheets.
2.0,"I love the feel of the fabric, I know I won't feel hot when wearing it.  I am 200lbs 5'7 and it fit me kinda close but not in a bad way i'd prefer something a lil roomy.  The length is ok, I am not a fan of anything above the knee and it reaches me a lil above the knee.  An inch on both sides and i'd have a perfect fit (my liking)"
2.0,Love everything about it except the collar. After one wash it got deformed and wrinkled to give the “bacon neck” look. Not sure why they don’t use a double stitch to keep it flat.
2.0,Didnt fit properly had to use tape for a temp hold
2.0,Too small. Will exchange/return. Cute shoe though.
2.0,Did not think the quality was good. Plus too large for my body type.
2.0,Runs big! Texture of materia is creepy...
2.0,Polyester blend fabric very much unsexy...
2.0,It was ok...but the material made it look and feel very very cheap!! Sent it back.
2.0,The color is not white!! It has a blue tint to it. Also see through.
2.0,Not really big. Still very small shades.
2.0,"I expected leather, this is paper thin pleather. I ordered a XS and received a medium which actually got my 13 year old son. Its cheap and poor quality. Would be good for a costume or something like that."
2.0,The sting broke after a few weeks of wear😞
2.0,not as long as photo appeared. ONly went to mid calf
2.0,And then when washed per instructions it had to be given away! My daughter Couldn’t even breathe in it.
2.0,"It is thin and not that warm, but it does help. I like that that the neck isn't too big because it helps keep shoulders warm when sleeping."
2.0,"This suit is gorgeous,  extremely uncomfortable!"
2.0,"This hat is very cute, but it is wide and shallow. It is too big, but I'm not sure it will ever fit correctly because it is so shallow."
2.0,I wanted to like this necklace but the shape of the bar that goes around your neck is awkward and oval shaped instead of round. I have a very thin neck but because of the design the necklace wouldn't lay flat.
2.0,Going to return it bc the slits at the bottom are crooked and it’s loose under the armpit area. Love the fit of the dress however and it runs true to size. I’m 5’1” 145lbs
2.0,"It's cute, but doesn't really stay on your ear :("
2.0,Too large hard to keep up.
2.0,This dress is not as pretty as they are in the picture. The run large too.
2.0,"Bulky, curvature and color choice was wrong."
2.0,It was cute but really short and wrinkles easily. I gave it to my daughter. Pretty color though.
2.0,"Way too small, so disappointed considering I got a 3X"
2.0,"The dress is too short for me.  In the photo it looks quite long.  I'm 5'.6"" and it was too short for me.  Disappointed me."
2.0,Velcro closing mechanism doesn’t stay closed if my girl runs around.
2.0,Very short battery life...
2.0,"The sizing chart is off. I ordered a small as I have a small bust and average waist, but this was almost impossible to get on. I would suggest going up about a size or two for a comfortable fit."
2.0,I thought this material would be soft but it’s more stiff and not too stretchy. Design is nice but it would be better if it were made of a different material. Normally wear small to medium but small was too small.
2.0,"It's not for me. Sits high, rubs head. Just not for me. But...I am a picky hat snob. Lol."
2.0,Runs very small! Ughhhh
2.0,I should have known better to not order this since the dress is even unflattering on the model. But I thought maybe it would look better on a figure that had a larger chest. I was wrong.
2.0,These insoles are not made for mens feet.<br />They are very narrow and short
2.0,Fits a little too small and bad print image
2.0,WAY TOO BIG I have average to small wrists and even taking all the links out it was huge on me. Such a waste of money
2.0,too large had to return
2.0,"Avoid their white shorts, which are practically sheer.  When I looked at the 3 pairs in the first image, I thought they were light gray - don't be fooled."
2.0,"Much smaller than expected, fell apart when I tried to put them on."
2.0,The pictures were very well done!  The jacket quality upon receiving was awful!  It was returned!
2.0,I did not like this dress. I tried it on a few times but I could not leave the house with it. It's see-through and some of the stitches in the front are not aligned and make it awkward to wear.
2.0,"The frame is much smaller then expected. Also the shape isn't flattering to my face. I wore them a couple times, but not anymore. Glasses came in a nice case with a cleaning cloth. Maybe good for children or smaller faces. Otherwise, what I received was exactly as described."
2.0,This robe is excellent! It is soft and plush and cozy. The reason for the two star review is because a shoulder seam came undone the first time I wore it. Nothing tore; the material was just not sewn properly in the seam. I don’t see any way to contact the seller besides writing a review so I’ll see what happens: currently the beautiful garnet color is unavailable so I don’t know how to exchange for an undamaged one.
2.0,When first pulling them out of the bag they looked great. There was no bad smell and the material felt nice...<br /><br />Once i put them on i noticed that jo matter how much i tucked the left pocket in it just wouldn't stay so you could visibly see the lining and stitching which looked bad....<br /><br />The zipper would not stay up for anything and throught the day the jeans stretched and became really saggy....<br /><br />If you struggle to find thr right length for jeans these would work if you want a cheap pair... orher than that i would not purchase again.<br /><br />Also stitching is yellow on the pair i got and white in the picture.... not at all what i want!<br /><br />These are not denim
2.0,Way too small! Wasn't worth sending back though. This went into garbage!
2.0,Too tight around the waistline.
2.0,"Description says black, more like ash gray. Besides that color fading, it’s fairly comfortable even on longer rides."
2.0,Poor thing got broken same day... Magnet lock is engineering error!
2.0,bent...cheap...but you get what you pay for. I thought it was a very cute Idea and if they had been made with pride instead of cost then they might have lasted more than just at the plant where they were put into bubble wrap and shipped off to me in a tiny little envelope where the one came bent.
2.0,Muy pequeño el producto y no hay opciones de pedir mas grande.
2.0,The colors wears off in a matter of days. To bad because they are cute.
2.0,backpack broke off cat early on
2.0,Fair quality low impact sport bra
2.0,"Looks nice but its very poor quality, its ok for the price...they charged me twice."
2.0,Item is much smaller than expected
2.0,"Very small, I have larger arms but I'm no body builder and these cut off my circulation even when worn at my forearm. I'm 6'2 265 if that helps."
2.0,Material too flimsy. Flies all over the place during work outs.<br />Bought it for the color appearance. Was disappointed.
2.0,"The slipper does not breathe and it gets too hot, even just by sitting.  The sole of the slipper seems to be a hard plastic material instead of rubber.  But the slipper is soft and does look pretty.  My shoe size is 8 1/2 - 9 US mens.  I ordered the Medium size mens and should've ordered the large instead since the slipper runs small."
2.0,Cute but uncomfortable. My daughter has blisters after 20 mins.
2.0,pay a little more and buy something that durable...
2.0,The shirt itself has a pretty print but the material feels like a rain jacket. It doesn't lay right on the body and is very tight. Mine also came with a very noticeable stain on the front. Keep your few dollars on this Japanese mess.
2.0,"I was so excited to get this dress, it is SO cute, but it was so much shorter than I expected. I am only 5'4"" and it barely covered my butt. Not only was it too short it also has a zipper feature (something I totally must have misead when checking product details). I wanted this to be comfy, wear everyday dress, but the zipper made it uncomfortable to wear, it was tight on top, loose & too short on the bottom. It is probably best for short, slimmer people."
2.0,"These are nice & pretty but I must have misread information because I thought they were threaders.  So for that reason, I don’t like them & they’re too much trouble to get on for me to wear."
2.0,"Smaller than expected, and I even ordered a size larger than I usually wear.  The photo looks like it will have some ""flow"".  It does not.  I kept it because I did like the berry color and the price was right, but I tuck it in and wear as a nice tshirt."
2.0,The material was so soft but even ordering one size up it was way too tight
2.0,I really wanted to love these but as I wore them the paint chipped off on all of them they're super cool but only to look at I guess I wouldn't wear them
2.0,Chain broke after the first used. The pendant looked ok. All I can say is you pay what you get for.
2.0,This necklace and glasses are very cheaply made and the glasses only work if held at one odd angle. I’m very disappointed
2.0,"Way too small! Ordered a 14/16. Was too small for my other daughter sized 10/12, too. It's too bad- the suit is really cute. Am returning it."
2.0,big and cheap
2.0,"The watch band was attractive in the silver mesh I was looking for, but I found the 2-piece band impossible to tighten enough to get an O2 reading on my Apple 6 watch. I felt like I needed another hand to pull the pieces together tightly.  Since I only have 2 hands, I had to return it"
2.0,"Pants tore on the bottom of the leg the first time they were used. Material is poor quality, I would not buy them again."
2.0,"The skirt is cute and looks nice even though the fabric is low quality. The tank top, however, is a disaster. The bottom isn't actually hemmed and the straps are sewn so the fabric sticks out."
2.0,The product was a size smaller than American sizing (ordered 3x fit like 2x) and the quality of the graphics was subpar. You could see the outline of images that were not meant to be seen. The seller was extremely responsive and quick to resolve my issue.
2.0,"I think I should have realized when it was called &#34;BLING&#34; jewelry it would be cheap looking and gaudy.  I thought, o wow, this must be great because of the original price and big markdown.  They are supposed to be pierced earrings but I could not see how.  These fit right in with the Disney princess jewelry so gave to my 4 year old granddaughter.  I guess I am just too old to wear these."
2.0,Fits smallest
2.0,"I love the color! I got the green.  However thats really the only thing right with it. I really wanted it as an oversized shirt dress.  Nope.  Its long enough to be a mini dress and hits upper thighs, but definitely not big enough.  Im wearing it as a tshirt because its too tight around my butt and thighs.  I also expected more of a cotton style but its nylon or somthing and VERY thin.  For how I wanted to wear it, Id say the XL would have been great when I was 130 (Im 5'7"" so 130 is pretty thin for me).  I gave it 2 stars because its wearable as a regular shirt with the bottom being pulled up to my waist making the enite thing cute for a shirt to go walking in--hard to explain in writing--but definitely not what I was buying for.  I will not buy this again, but Im not gonna return it either."
2.0,I wouldn't consider this a high impact sport bra. Yoga maybe but definately not enough support for running etc. Comfortable otherwise.
2.0,The band itself is comfortable and breathes okay. The low rating is due to the metal piece rusting after just a days use. I basically just threw this away and put on my less comfortable stock watch band.
2.0,They’re great goggles but you can’t wear them properly due to the clasps being on and clasping backwards. Can’t use because the pieces dig into the head as a result. Non functional
2.0,Just too small for size 4 woman.
2.0,The earring seem way smaller than pictured so if you don't have a ruler near by get one. Plus it fades quick but it's cute while it last.
2.0,It doesn't looks like a pic.. yellow diamond doesn't look yellow.  It just look white-ish grey. It doesn't have that real rich look like pic does.. I'm thinking about returning it.
2.0,I only received 9/10 keychains.
2.0,Bottom was true to size however the top was smaller.
2.0,Cheaply made & very thin. These shorts show cellulite and are not flattering. Keeping to wear around the house but definitely not wearing these in public.
2.0,"Run small, even for compression pants. Was like trying to put on child’s tights. If your between sizes go up. For some reason my return window was too small so by the time I gifted and realized they were too small, I couldn’t rerun them."
2.0,"Don't bother ordering the slipper.  The slipper is not therapeutic at all!  Just order the insert and put it in the OVERSIZED shoes you already have.  Yes, they sell just the insert!  The insert works for around the house.  But, I can only walk, when I leave the house, for about 15 min and then they trigger the neuromas, even with these inserts.  But, they are better that most inserts and worth trying!  Even so, after about 15 min of walking I am back to flip flops for the rest of the day.  However, normally I can not walk for 15 min. in a closed toe shoe.  So, the inserts are partly effective, and may work really well for people who have less severe neuromas."
2.0,"The bag itself works well & appears sturdy, but the color was much lighter & has a grey color that makes the bag appear dirty. I want to return since I bought it for the vibrant color."
2.0,Way too bulky and heavy for my cartilage piercing. Great quality though
2.0,What you see is not what you get. It was really small and really cheap looking. I returned it because it wasn't what I wanted for a nice dinner out.
2.0,the picture is misleading.  Looks much bigger and chain looks much more stronger.  Overall it was ok
2.0,"Cute design, but broke and unraveled the second time I wore it."
2.0,It tarnished/discolored by the end of the first day.  I wasn't expecting it not to tarnish... but didn't think it would discolor that quickly!
2.0,"We got this yesterday.  My daughter loves how soft it is.<br /><br />We bought a larger size, but it is really really large around the middle.  It looks weird.  Also it already has a hole in it.  That's disappointing."
2.0,It sead men's gloves there more like female size gloves
2.0,The print on them ended up being very pixelized and blurry. Not very nice looking swim trunks.
2.0,Fits odd in the front. Not the best material
2.0,So small and cheap fabric! Save your money and buy something that will fit.
2.0,"I'm really disappointed. These are incredibly hard to open and close, and these definitely are not a standard 16g. It was too big to fit into my piercing; my nose screw which is a 16g actually fit inside the end of the hinge."
2.0,The chain set looks cheaper than I expected. Also the rings that link the parts together keep coming undone.
2.0,"I like the size and style, but wish the material was softer.  Even after washing, it’s rough and itchy.  Also the seams on the bottom ruffle came apart in a couple places after just one wearing."
2.0,Runs soooo small
2.0,I normally wear a small or medium and ordered the one size assuming it meant one size fits all or whatever and they are too small
2.0,Returned these. I was really looking for thin shorts that could be worn under other workout clothes and these are thicker than is comfortable to layer. They also ride up on the inside of the thighs super easy and are uncomfortable.
2.0,The dress was cheaply made and the back of the dress does not fit properly it is really loose. Dress has been returned.
2.0,The wings are very small and the elastic broke with in two days.
2.0,"I love the front of this suit. It's lined well and looks cute from the front. The back is not lined, the back fabric is thin and the suit looks awful from the back. I think if the whole suit were lined, I would have loved it and kept it."
2.0,"I expected sturdy, thick material.  It is actually very thin and never hangs the way it does in the picture."
2.0,"Nothing loose about it, way smaller than it should be!"
2.0,sent it back for a refund & did it w/ no problems
2.0,"I had such high hopes for this ear cuff! It's so cute but is very uncomfortable to wear and falls off easily. You can bend it a little to fit your ear better but to keep it on it almost has to be too tight. Some soft pads under the feet might help? I am still looking for an easy solution to the comfort problem. The other downside is because of the design, the frog sits on the back of your ear lobe so all you see is one arm/leg. Had it been designed with one longer arm/leg and one shorter arm/leg, the frog would sit more towards the face and be noticeable."
2.0,"I wanted to love this, I'm not sure how to rate this.... I read so many reviews and decided to take a chance, but unfortunately I had a lot of the same problems the others complained about. So, the suit itself is really nicely made and feels very sturdy. I ordered a large based on the reviews and I usually wear a 10/12. The problem was the chest part. While it pulled very hard on my shoulders the gap that was left by the 'side boob' was substantial. It was also pretty loose in the center where the keyhole part is. So it pulls tight on the shoulders and chest where it crosses and gives you no support everywhere else and makes you have pancake looking boobs. Also the seem where the chest part meets the shoulder straps hits right by your collar bone so it kinda looks like you're wearing your bathing suit wrong. I could see this working if you are very thin with a very large chest with breasts that are very high or perky, but for us every day women, it just doesn't cut it. Returned it and am trying a different style."
2.0,Very tight t-shirt and the quality isn't as good as I expected.
2.0,"too tight, pockets almost to my knees. love the print."
2.0,This dress didn’t come as the color that was portrayed and is cheaply made.
2.0,"This Truity Men's Sports Jacket Hooded Lightweight Windbreaker doesn't fit correctly. I ordered and received an X-Large, which is my size and yet it fit more like a Large would fit on me. Then on top of all that the zipper is what can only be described as a ""lefthanded zipper."" So it doesn't fit, has a backwards zipper and on top of all that, I don't really care for the feel or the look of it. After all this you might ask, ""why 2 stars and not just one?"" Well, I have seen worse, that's why."
2.0,"The zipper head & tab on the inner pocket came off in my hand when I closed it after opening to check size of pocket. Because of this, I returned the bag for a full refund."
2.0,Too big for everyday wear which is what i was looking for
2.0,This really doesn't catch hair that well.  It's too big for my preschooler and too small for a small adult. The fabric is fine.  The loops that make this thing curve up seem ineffective.  But it does catch some hair and can be clipped together with a hair clip instead of the velcro.
2.0,This was very small for my general size. I’m generally a L to XL and this fits more like a medium. And the sequins don’t flip.
2.0,Shipping was fast.  Got the shirt in one day. Colors were vibrant.  The only Hang up was I ordered a large and it was like a small.
2.0,"So I needed a Vegas dress and I found this dress, honestly it fits weird. I'm 170 pounds 5'7 I wear a size 12 dress and I got an XL bc of people saying the dress fits small. But it doesn't fit small it's just the length of the dress (shirt) that they are saying is small...<br />It doesn't come with the knot- without the knot it looks like a mans shirt with a cut out in the front.<br />There is this band on the top (I took a pic) it literally sticks out?? It just looks weird I wouldn't waste your money..."
2.0,This is a cute and sport jersey dress that is made to appear as if you have tied a seater around your waist.  The colors are a light heather and white. The concept is cute but I do not believe that the sizing is American cut.  It was quite a bit smaller in size that I was expecting.  The length was right above the knee and is perfect for tennis shoe-dress wearing.  The dress itself is thin and is more appropriate for early fall or late spring.
2.0,Unimpressed... the leg area by your ankles is absurdly tight.
2.0,"The description says for girls age 7-12 years old. When I got the socks, they were too small. I think the description should say toddler/girl shoe sizes 7-12 instead of years. My daughter is average height and has normal, skinny feet, and is almost 9 years old. These socks may have fit her little fee when she was 3-5. Size description too confusing or simply miss labeled."
2.0,"I wanted to like the leggings, but the material was not up to my expectations & the quality of the sewing was not great. I felt like I was wearing a black trash bag. I returned it. Also, the inseam is better suited for shorter people.."
2.0,"These are much larger than I originally thought they would be, which is fine, but If you're wearing a jacket or coat they get caught in the collar all the time.  They are also very heavy and I can't wear them for very long."
2.0,"This are not photochromatic as advertised. They aren’t bad shades but not what I paid for as I specifically wanted the transition lenses. It wasn’t worth the time, effort or cost to return them."
2.0,Looks cool but don't stay in mouth and is a waste of money. Should of gotten a refund.
2.0,"I get a lor of compliments on the glittery band. But, it didn't fit my galaxy watch. I had top trim the leather and use the pins from my old band."
2.0,Just did not look good on me.
2.0,Cheaply made.  Fell apart.  Would rather spend money on better bag.  Do not waste any money on this product.  Thanks
2.0,Waaaaay too small. It said it would fit a double d size and there is no way this does the job. The pads need to be bigger because there's more mass to cover.
2.0,Just not my style.
2.0,Cheap see through fabric
2.0,It's good for going out but the clip piece came loose the first day I got it. Not really worth investing in even though it's cheap.
2.0,Super soft looks great....for the 5 seconds I was able to wear it. The strap snapped right off of the top. Bleh.... I might be able to fix it but was really sad I couldn't wear it long enough to at least look at it in the mirror 😭
2.0,"They hurt my ears after about 1/2 hour on the plane, too tight."
2.0,"The look is great, easy to install and wear except it was very tight on my wrist.  I have an average wrist size and this was digging into my skin."
2.0,"An obvious rip-off of the Gym Shark version. But cool with me because these are WAYYY cheaper. Cute outfit overall, but it doesn't fit me perfectly. Lines on the butt should be right under the butt cheek but the lines are a little high on me. I think this is because I have bigger hips/butt, but others may not have this issue. Just beware if you've got a bigger bottom! Besides the lines, the outfit overall fits fine. I am 5'5, 145lb, and got a size Large.  I wore it all day and is pretty comfortable. Not my favorite. Fits very much like the ""seamless"" line from Fabletics which is skin-tight. Some people love it and say it fits like a second skin, but I am lukewarm on the fit because after a while I'm ready to take them off. It almost feels like I'm wearing a giant compression sock."
2.0,Fell apart after wearing a few times. The string broke week 1 and now the strap to tighten is also missing. Cute but not worth the money.
2.0,"it has a funny shape their . i think it is for a person who is one size straight up and down. it is soft, but it does not fit and the other two from this same manufacturer, fit very well, that i ordered at the same time."
2.0,Not as advertised - too small
2.0,Too small and flimsy sent it back
2.0,Looks great for about a year then it faded chipped and looked like what I bought it for. My recommendation titaniumrings.com great selection and you wont spend thousands and the quality lasts and lasts!!!
2.0,"They work, but not a great cut and not very comfortable comparatively to other trunks I own.  The waist is hard to keep cinched.  Would not buy again."
2.0,I am 145 lbs at 5'9 i ordered a Large and the top is somewhat small and the bottoms are too big.
2.0,My glasses arrived with clear lenses... logistical glitch?
2.0,The XL fit more like a med/large. My daughter couldn’t wear them.
2.0,Very short in front. Shorter than described. Too short in the front for me but the fit around was as described.
2.0,I only have one pocket on the dress??? Suppose to have two. Ordered 2 other dresses and they both have 2 pockets.
2.0,These skorts ran very small in size.  I wish they would have fit because they were very cute and looked well made.
2.0,"I ended up getting the customized apron. The picture and text were exactly what I wanted. It was under $10 so the material isn't that great, but it was more of a ""gag gift"" for my sister in Christmas. I ordered this in November and it got lost in the mail. When requesting my money back 5 days before Christmas, it magically was found on December 24th."
2.0,Hat has a big cheap white logo on the front...looks nothing like the picture
2.0,"Pretty cheap-ish. If you want something quality, look elsewhere."
2.0,"I opened the package and a white cardboard piece fell out of the dress when I unfolded it. There was partial dinosaur prints/dye stains from the dress on the cardboard. I figured it did it's job and put the dress away. When I pulled it out later in the evening, I inspected it closer and then realized that the dye had bled all over the white of the dress. It looked dirty from all the colors. It would have been a super cute dress if not for all of the stains"
2.0,The neck line on this is way bigger than what you expect. The shirt is not sewn together well and does not give you that athletic fit that you think you're going to get. Definitely wouldn't recommend this shirt. I currently use it to sleep in.
2.0,Screw fell out of hinge week 6
2.0,"Not true to size, and very light material...see thu"
2.0,Took a gamble. This item was inexpensive and it it shows. Annoyed I cannot easily return as was listed as a Prime item....I guess I have to go through the seller directly; which means paying the return cost. I'll read the fine print next time
2.0,Socks are not white. They are beige.
2.0,Does not stay down—forever sticking out several millimeters. Too bad bc it’s cute.
2.0,2 stars only because I was refunded all of my money after some hassle. But the Snow White does not look like the picture. The arms are like a tshirt. I'm throwing it away. Glad I got my money back.
2.0,"Cute style, but I thought I was getting rayon and this feels like a heavy polyester. Does not breathe well."
2.0,I don't recommend this it looks like the picture but it's very see through and and a rough itchy material I ordered a large and it was still to small and in 5'7 and 138 pounds
2.0,Can you please send a replacement mask ASAP..I will send back mask that is not working hope to have replacement for Halloween
2.0,"I got an XL because I am an XL, and it did not go up past the cheeks 😂 so warning for my curvy ladies, you may wanna go up to the biggest size but even then I don't think it'll make much of a difference."
2.0,It looks cheap and poorly made
2.0,"It does not look like the picture. The quality was very flimsy, the top was not stretched to hold the lace and the bottom was longer and loser than expected."
2.0,thought it was non- magnetic...
2.0,"It seemed like good quality when it first arrived, but within a few days my bears started falling out :( very disappointed."
2.0,"These felt wet and had a bad chemical odor. I  hung them out to detoxify. They fit well, but smell like chemicals.<br />SMELLY"
2.0,"They’re really cute but don’t stay on my shoes well, I have like one left. I wouldn’t recommend cause you’ll lose then within a week."
2.0,the size that they have is not the actual size as it is too small for me. I know as I wear that in a lot of other clothes
2.0,It's not as clear printed as other anime shirts I've gotten. Material is weird.
2.0,"This is not infant sized, it is toddler sized"
2.0,Took so long to get here I forgot I purchased it . Unfortunately it was pretty small and I ordered a large . Material was somewhat see through and item didn’t fit my needs
2.0,I like the color but it the stones are so tiny. I have many turquoise jewelry but these stones are so small it should have been made for infant or children jewelry. I'm disappointed and I think expensive for the size.
2.0,This watch band is nicely crafted. the quality seems nice but it doesn’t last. I had it on for 2 days and I don’t do anything  strenuous and it broke. Luckily I felt it snap off and didn’t lose my watch. Could you imagine. I definelty wont be using this again.
2.0,The stem is too short to fit into ear and put the back on
2.0,Shirt itches sooo bad.
2.0,I sized down and it was still extremely big. I will be returning it.
2.0,The charm is a bit smaller than I thought it would be. Looks inexpensive.
2.0,I don’t know who this band is supposed to fit. I’m 6’3 260 and I have to have it on the very last hole to keep my watch from sliding around. Is decent looking but it’s huge. Should have just paid the extra money for the official garmin leather band.
2.0,The colors faded within like 2 weeks but I loved it when I first got it
2.0,"It's thin, it's Much smaller than pictured, and incredibly cheep looking. I wasn't expecting much for the price but this isn't worth it."
2.0,I bought this hoping to wear it to my bridal shower. Unfortunately it was loose in all the wrong places and looked pretty sloppy. I was disappointed because it looked amazing in the picture
2.0,"I went by the guide and the reviews,and it's to big,the top has no support,there are cups but the sides need support as well .i will not wear it,I'll give it to a needy person"
2.0,"I have to wind this watch at least once every hour or two to ensure that it keeps time.  The motion of the watch really doesn't work at all.  You would have to be running a marathon to get this thing to self wind.  Looks really good, but if it doesn't keep time, it is just jewelry..."
2.0,"Basic long t-shirt design, so you'd think it would be hard to screw up... but alas, it runs small and the neck/sleeves are kinda boxy. Also, the front of the shirt was picked up in the sleeve stitching, so part of the front was sewn to the sleeve. I had to cut apart the stitching; and I intend to repair this and use it as a sleep shirt, otherwise I would be returning it."
2.0,The fit was great. Definitely did it job while working out. I have it only two stars because on only the second wear did the seams rip in two places and while I was working out I was stabbed in my sides with the hard plastic piece.
2.0,"It was short, and the material seemed scratchy so will be returning"
2.0,Big and cheap looking. Gave them away immediately.
2.0,It took a month and a half to get here and was way too small and short. The design was cute and the manufacturer was kind
2.0,NOT Compliant to NFPA 1971!! I like the fit but must have NFPA 1971 compliant gloves
2.0,Looks cheap. made of plastic and paper...
2.0,Looks cool as knit hat but the logo on the side make it really ugly!!!<br />It's not visible on your photos!!
2.0,Eh it barely covers my breasts and has the same clasp as a bikini top so I'm guessing this isn't really a bra but more like a sexy top for a 2 piece.
2.0,"Very large fit, I returned them."
2.0,"These are not very comfortable, heavy, hard to breathe..."
2.0,Runs small!  Order up 2 sizes!
2.0,"For the price they're a nice little set.  The ear rings are nicer than the necklace, which was a little on the toy side."
2.0,I was disappointed. I ordered a size that supposedly would fit me but it fitted me tight. Also it is a bit see through. Which i didn't want. And it is NOT flowy like it shows in the photo. The material is thin but its soft. And it rolls up. sigh. I'm 5'3 so i thought it would fit me long but it really didn't. I would of liked it longish.
2.0,"The ring itself arrived promptly and as described. It’s really very pretty. It was a gift for my mother.  But after a month of wearing it, the silver has started wearing off and a dull coppery reddish tone is showing. This ring was advertised as sterling silver. We’ve tried using silver polish but it’s only rubbing more of the silver off. Overall very disappointed that a ring advertised as sterling is in fact not."
2.0,"Might have to return it, can’t fully adjust it to my comfort since I used the last two holes on my original band, and this one is much shorter. We’ll see, might update after going out with it for a day but for right now, I’m not sold on this.<br /><br />UPDATE: I returned it. It is too snug and hurts my wrist after 1 hr of wearing it! Definitely do not recommend if you want the band to be comfortable."
2.0,Didn't line up good with the case as advertised but at least it's stainless steel
2.0,"Burgundy it is NOT. Fire Engine Red is what I got. Material is a notch above see through thin; 65% cotton, 35% polyester. I am a size 8/10 (5&#34;8, 140 lbs) and I ordered an XL. It was larger than I needed, but if I wash & dry expect it would fit more appropriately. I was able to wear both off the shoulders and not, likely b/c it was a bit big on me. I could see how it would be cute, but not interested in generic black and grey."
2.0,The fabric on these were too thin and revealing.
2.0,These arrived in a package of three. When I opened the package I noticed two of the three had a small hole in the back in the same spot (not in a seam) I decided to just wear them anyway cause they’re cheap and my legs were black from the color transferring onto my legs!<br />They are comfy but low quality. Wouldn’t recommend.
2.0,Need to returned it. Extremely small. Ordered my size but did not fit at all.
2.0,"It’s cheaply made ...<br />After a couple of uses , the spring that clips onto the unit , pops and breaks ...<br />Do yourself a favor ...<br />Invest on a more durable product......"
2.0,"Got this as a gift that is been longing for. Presentation wise, it's breath taking. It's just beautiful. But it tangles super super easy. Especially on itself. The string/twine is waxy and the small pearls and end pieces love to tangle together making it a huge pain to untangle. Had I know how incredibly easy it is to get twisted around itself and then needing fixing before it gets worse, if NEVER of asked for this even though it is more beautiful than pictures show."
2.0,Thought these were mens gloves...definitely not. Good fit thought but not for a man.
2.0,Made for someone with a very short torso and runs small.
2.0,I ordered a large. I usually wear a medium. Way way to small. Gave it to my granddaughter  looks cute on her. For the money great little buy.
2.0,is not as large as they say
2.0,"Not what expected, Looked tacky and not what expected.  I have order other knuckle rings and came out excellent.  This rings looked really fake."
2.0,"I am 5'6"" and these pants were very comfortable and cut nicely when I tried them on, but about 4"" too short."
2.0,I was excited to give this to my son but when I opened the battery compartment to change the battery and it was rusted and the coils were green!!!
2.0,Came with alot but they do brake easy . If you are looking for any bigger pieces for your nose they all do run on small. I did not like the selection very much when I saw them in person.
2.0,Cheap product.<br />After the first wash they started getting holes in them..
2.0,"Super fragile, not as bright as the add."
2.0,I ordered these dresses 3 times and each time something was wrong eith the fabric. Twice there were white spots where there was supposed to be color and once there was something like an ink stain near the collar. Lots of thread sticking out and just not good quality.
2.0,"This is the Puerto Rican flag, I think before posting something do your research first.  I think it makes you look bad when you don't know your merch."
2.0,"I wanted to like this bag so much, but I just couldn't.  First off, the color is nothing like the picture.  It is more of a cheap looking nude color, not at all the rich looking tan/brownish color in the pictures.  Next, I used it for about a month, and it was just very difficult to find anything in it.  It is a large bag, which I prefer, but it has a fabric divider in the middle of it, that just seems to collapse into the bag, somewhat always burying my stuff.  I would have to actively dig to find anything, and after a month, I just couldn't handle it anymore!  It's just not worth the fight everyday to find my wallet!"
2.0,"Loved it but, broke. Asked for replacement and was rejected. Very upset"
2.0,it is programmable for multiple garage doors but the range is around 20-30 feet.
2.0,Was not what I thought I was getting.  Too small and thin.
2.0,I loved the colors and design but it was too large.
2.0,"Ok so I am very disappointed.  when I received the dress, the dress had deodorant all on it. It's this things in the inside of the dress, that's loose. It can't be sewed down. You can't pull it up either. It's just extremely awkward. I put on the dress in the body it felt great body-wise in the breast area it is loose piece of fabric that's just there you can't really fold it in because it don't look right you can't pull it out because it don't go that way. I do know if I didn't have an event Saturday and it wasn't too late for me to return it and get another dress I would have returned it"
2.0,"Really pretty dress, but ... I would normally buy a 2x (size 20), but on seeing reviews decided to buy the 3 x.  Unfortunately it is way too small.<br />According to the size chart, a 3x should be:<br />Size<br />3X<br />US Size 22W - 24W<br />Bust 50 - 52<br />Waist 43 - 45<br /><br />In reality, this dress has the ACTUAL measurements of the size chart's Size 12:<br />Size 0X<br />US Size 12W<br />Bust 40<br />Waist 33<br /><br />I couldn't really try it on, but when i draped its shoulder to mine, the waist would have hit in the middle of my bust.<br />I'm giving 2 stars for the color/look and the free returns!"
2.0,Definitely not a one size fits all!  They were nice to refund 20% if I kept it.  Figured that was cheaper than the hassle of returning it to China!
2.0,"Very hot material, felt like I was wearing a curtain"
2.0,Was looking for walking shoes but these are soft on the bottom. Not happy with it.
2.0,The product did not arrive as advertised.
2.0,The glasses are cute but literally upon receiving the package the case was already falling apart. Just received this item 10 minutes ago and half of the reason for my order was how cute the case was and how it would come in handy and prevent scratches on the lenses. I’d say a replacement case should be sent because this is a birthday present for my daughter and it’s unacceptable how badly damaged it is.
2.0,"The cut is cute - I like the v neck. Unfortunately, the brown animal print looks more pink than brown. Also, the actual fabric is awful. It is super thick and shiny making the top look incredibly cheap. It will be going back."
2.0,"These shoes where so nice and the price was awesome to, at first everything was fine with these shoes my daughter loved them. Then after 4 days the sole of the shoes started to get rips inside where the foot rests. I had to pull it up and noticed that the base of the shoe Under the sole was made of tiny little holes which my daughter complained of it being uncomfortable so I had to put something to replace the original ripped sole of the shoe and super glue it. After this I thought to myself well they where very affordable so it’s alright. But then that wasn’t just it the Velcro from where the shoe ties or comes together stopped sticking together And that’s where it was a problem because it meant I had to replace the Velcro and I just bought these shoes in the end of July and all this happens between the first and second week of purchase. My Daughter was very upset. But what can you expect for $11 shoes."
2.0,Was not happy to see they were more of a spandex than a faux leather. I normally wear a size 12. Bought size large and they were too big in the legs. I definitely have to wear knee high boots to cover up the looseness in the lower legs. A medium probably would have been a better fit. They are thin and a tunic shirt is a necessity with these leggings.
2.0,"These slip off my feet, I cannot bend to pull on need my caregiver to help."
2.0,The quality is not like I expected. It looks thicker in the pictures.
2.0,falls apart. not reinforced very well
2.0,Broke after only having it on for a couple hours
2.0,This dress looks nice but not on . It’s tight around waist . I think it may be due to a seam at the widest part of waist.
2.0,"I love Arc'teryx products - I have a vest, jacket, and coat from them, and I recommend them to everyone who will listen. The quality is always far better than the consumer-grade stuff you get from the likes of North Face.<br /><br />However, at this price point, it really feels like they phoned it in on these gloves. The palms and wrist are shaped well and fit my hands like gloves always do, but the fingers are weirdly long, which makes the touchscreen fingertips less effective. I appreciate that they went for an embroidered logo on the back, but the quality of the stitching is poor, resulting in a low-resolution reproduction of the logo. I've had mine for about 3 weeks, and already the edge of the stitching has come loose.<br /><br />The worst thing is the band that goes around your wrist - it barely stretches at all, and if my hands were any bigger, there's no way I'd be able to get them into the gloves.<br /><br />I know what you're thinking: ""Dude, you're going to want that security when you're ice climbing. These aren't just for gripping a BMW wheel."" Fair enough, but these gloves don't have enough gripping surface for real sports like that. Look at the leather coverage: there's no finger grip at all except on your index fingertips. Also, these gloves aren't warm enough and lack the hard surface shell you'd want for most winter mountaineering in the first place.<br /><br />In the end, these gloves aren't worth the money because they don't really solve a problem: They aren't nearly practical enough for enthusiasts, and they aren't nice enough for commuters. This feels like the first - and hopefully last - time Arc'teryx just slapped a logo on something and called it a day."
2.0,Fits fine but the fabric is super thin. I cant wear it because it is so thin and see thru. I gave it to my daughter.
2.0,the gold is very thin and looks cheap.  To be expected I suppose.
2.0,"mmmmm....I just don't know what to think. Firstly I followed the size chart and it is still a bit too tight. Secondly, there is NO way this qualifies as a dress. Good luck to anyone who tries to wear it as such, you might end up cited for indecent exposure. Thirdly, the sleeves do have thumb holes, however the sleeves are way too short for the bunch-up effect around the wrists that you see in the product picture. The sleeves are so short in fact that I cannot use the thumb holes at all. Finally, there is just not enough fabric altogether for the garment to be loose on the body. As it is now, it is skin tight, period.<br />Also, be warned that the sleeves are assembled with the seams inside out. I had not noticed it in the picture but, upon closer inspection, it is definitely meant to be that way. And the fabric is thin -think tee-shirt thin.<br /><br />So all in all, I am just not happy with it but I will keep it bc it was cheap and I can wear it as an under layer or something. Still, feels like a waste of money when you compare the pic to the received product."
2.0,"These appeared to be the right size when opening,  but I washed them before she wore them, and the size large looked like a size small they shrunk so much."
2.0,Overpriced waste of money. My 4 year old couldn't even fit them on her fingers for Halloween. The quality is nice but what is the point if you can't actually wear them? Skip the gloves like we did.
2.0,"We were looking for a “regular” black sport tee. This one fits ok, but is excessively long."
2.0,"Nice cardigan, BUT too small. Had to return it."
2.0,The stitching on the zipper cause problem with skirt. I had to undue zipper to be able wear.<br />Was not made well
2.0,"I have the assumption that most people who could benefit from compression socks are older with other health issues.  I am 70, and try to keep active.  However, I have arthritis in my hands, which makes these socks very difficult to get on and off.  Once on they feel good.  These socks are not ""easy on easy off"" for everyone."
2.0,It's ok didn't like them
2.0,"The color and pattern is nice, but this is not a v-neck. Returning."
2.0,Looks cheap. Seems like it's more for kids playing dress up then something to wear outside.
2.0,I usually wear an XL so I bough the 2XL.  It its so tight I barely got it on.  Shoulders and arms fit fine but the torso is entirely too small.
2.0,"Husband can't even wear it; arm holes are small/high/tight. Icky, slippy fabric, but at least it's fleece lined. Design is def cool. I've been wearing it since he can't. It's working ok on me, maybe bc I'm much shorter. Size XL, which is what I usually buy for both of us. I like bigger hoodies."
2.0,"Seriously looked like a diaper.  I am 5'5&#34;, 135 pounds with a long torso and I ordered a medium."
2.0,"They made the top like a lady’s top, buttons on wrong side."
2.0,Extremely long and just not flattering.
2.0,Pretty but won't last long. The material is cheap and literally your walking on floor. Never wear when it rains
2.0,avoid... not nice... doesnt fit properly. the screw at back is loose ... not worth the money
2.0,They looked really nice but were a tiny bit to big to fit properly. Will need to return unfortunately.
2.0,"I ordered a large, I got a men's small (although it says ladies large on the tag - weird). For being a layering cami, I get you want to make things tight so they stay in place, but good lord give a woman some room to breath.<br />My recommendation: order two sizes up."
2.0,Cute but way too small. Had to buy another outfit for a friend's 80's bachelorette. Accessories were perfect.
2.0,"break way too easily,also hurt when on."
2.0,I washed it once with cold water and the material is already faded and pilling. It's a stiff uncomfortable fabric too.
2.0,"Not very flattering.  Sweater is boxy, doesn’t drape well.  The material is itchy, not soft, actually looks as uncomfortable as it feels."
2.0,break extremely easily and very small
2.0,Water soaked through after 45 minutes of light to no rain
2.0,I was not happy with the color I got as opposed in the picture on-line. I wouldn’t have thought you allowed something like this to ship out
2.0,"Good Cap, decal was terrible."
2.0,The closure in the back just ties. Could come unraveled and if so there would be lots of exposure
2.0,Like the shirt but poor quality
2.0,"I was mislead by Jasmin-USA, I would not have bought it had I known it was made in China. Disappointed"
2.0,"Corre pequeño si despides comprarlo aumenta la talla, mi nieta es 7/8 yo compre 10 y le quedo pegado...la tela es transparente"
2.0,"Cute, but color not like the picture shows 😕"
2.0,I received my hat and I like it very much but it does have a flaw.  I have reached out to the company about this. If not for that I would give a much higher rating.  I will adjust when I hear from them.
2.0,small is real small
2.0,I loved the way the shorts fit but the zipper kept falling down and now the zipper just broke! Waste of money....
2.0,This product does not offer any support.
2.0,"Pretty, but the sole is very heavy, bulky and stiff.  These are really cute, but the color is tan, not yellow.  I had to return them because they were far too large and bulky to wear.  I was looking forward to wearing these a lot.  I have been on a search for rain boots that are comfortable enough to get me through the day.  These sure are adorable, but there is no way to wear them for long.  I wear a 6 and these in size 6 were enormous and very bottom heavy."
2.0,They make you feel fat!
2.0,"I purchased  a medium based off of their sizing guide and it's wrong. I'm a 34C and the medium fits like a small. The material is very thin, but it actually looks good on. Just size up."
2.0,"Bought ,broke so I exchanged. The replacement butterfly anklet broke first wear. So not durable ,the other anklet hasn't  broke but I actually bought the set for the butterfly anklet."
2.0,Shirt was just okay. I was hoping I could dress out up or dress it down but the look and overall feel was way too casual.  Ran too big and too long a well.
2.0,Not what I was hoping for. Did not fit after a turn in the washer and dryer.
2.0,"This item does not have a cord with a tassel tie in the back, it's just string otherwise I would give it a better review"
2.0,"bottoms are too baggy, and the top is far too small."
2.0,Beautiful necklace but the earrings are missing. I don’t know how to get the earrings.
2.0,"Disappointed how quickly they got holes in the, especially for the price, in addition to the price being higher for the small size."
2.0,"Bottoms were so small. Top was good for me. I'm part of the IBTC. So it was a good fit. If your larger chested, definitely not meant for you."
2.0,"These bands fit my Versa 3 perfectly.  They are comfortable, fit tightly, and the magnet is strong. These are well designed bands.. However, the reason I made my purchase was that I really liked the gray band with the orange edges.  When I received them, the gray on one side of the band was darker than the other side.  Since you pull the band thru itself to secure it, you have a band,that on your wrist, shows 2 different colors of gray. It looks really bad.  When I went back to the listing you can notice the color difference in the photos but there's  no mention of it.  I'm not accusing anyone of being deceptive, but buyer beware. Look at the photos closely. Therefore, when you purchase these 3 bands only 2 of them are  asthethically usable.  I returned them."
2.0,Not as I expected. But it will work for casual not dressy
2.0,Everything was great but shortly after using it a couple of times the top busk was loose.  It broke off after a few wears (wearing it 2 in smaller than natural waist).  Very disappointing.  I would not recommend this corset for waist training.
2.0,way longer than the picture shows - looks like a night dress
2.0,These are 2XL but seem made for someone who is short.  The are too short waisted.
2.0,"This bead was a grayish purple, not the clear vibrant purple pictured. I returned it. It is hard to find a true purple bead."
2.0,"I normally wear a size large in tops and size 12 bottoms. Ordered an XL. Not off the shoulder or baggy like pictured. It is comfy and nice material but waited longer than other items ordered in the same order, doesn't fit or hide my mommy tummy. Also pretty short."
2.0,"The fabric was cute and the cap is well sewn, however, after just one wash it faded drastically and ended up with a white haze and worn finish. Two washes and it was even worse. Needless to say, it ended up in the donation pile."
2.0,May fit a 7.5 wrist but hard to get over the hand. May be ok for a bride at her wedding but certainly not for daily wear. I bought 2. Didn't like them. Sent them back the day after I got them.
2.0,"They didn't work for me, my nipples are too large."
2.0,I went to buy a different chain for $20 that was sterling silver but for a boy. Also I had thought the basketball was round but that's okay.
2.0,These things are THICK. They do not make good liners since they don't fit under any gloves. I tried the L/XL as well as the S/M liners and they could not fit under any of the gloves I tried (large motorcycle winter gloves and snowboard gloves). I normally wear a medium sized glove.
2.0,This is the size I normally wear but it didn't fit at all.  I gave it to my daughter to wear.
2.0,This robe was very difficult to clean.  It would get dirty and no matter what you did it would not get clean.
2.0,"The set is very ""plastic"" but I guess for the price, its understandable. Its perfect for a DIY keyring."
2.0,"Bought this elastic strap watch for my elderly mother. It was OK, a bit big on her. Not thrilled with the quality of the strap and now it has snapped and isn't repairable. But it was pretty cheap so you get what you pay for."
2.0,It was a tad big and it did not flatter my 42D Cup size at all. Super cute everywhere else.
2.0,It broke in one hour
2.0,"Hmmm, I bought a large and this dress fits snug as a fitted shirt. If I had purchased an XL, it would be too long."
2.0,You cannot wear your hair in these because the stones aren't on the outside of the hoop at the back. I think there should have been a picture showing the back of the earring or at least it should have stated it in the description. They are nice but not putting the stones on the back make them look cheap.
2.0,it’s not waterproof
2.0,"The seller will take care of you if you are not satisfied - that part is good.  But the product itself does not deserve 5 starts.  I got a beige one, but the color is quite unattractive unlike the picture.  It is a lot darker and has ripple patterns(if you magnify, you might be able to see).  The zippers are very wide and jagged.  You need to maneuver the zipper back and forth to open/close them.  This will be inconvenient if you need something inside quickly.  The size and the pockets seem to be adequate for a travel tote."
2.0,To big just order you regular size.
2.0,I was expecting this to be made of wire bent and it's like metal etched or something. I found it uncomfortable and unattractive.
2.0,I loved it ...then it started to rust and it turned my finger grey. It started to itch too. Wish it was made out of titanium steel or stainless steel.
2.0,"I love the color but the material was not loose and the cut wasn't off my shoulder, like the description states. I ordered a size up, but it was too short and clingy."
2.0,Sizing is off. Runs 1-2 sizes smaller.
2.0,"These are really cute, but the fit was for a much wider foot.  I had to return them."
2.0,The fabric is see through and leaves nothing to the imagination. Even though the out fit fits in the torso and legs how the sleeves are sewn on it makes it impossible to move your arms. or lift them.
2.0,Unfortunately the button fell off after about 15 minutes of use on a joycon. I would recommend finding the official Nintendo ones.
2.0,"I ordered 3 sifferent robes to see what would work, what wouldn't. I had hopes for this. But I was being  realistic since it was priced as a ""value"" robe, not high end robe.<br />However, the fabric was VERY thin and sewing quality was 1 star at most. I had to return & start over.<br />There are other products out there in the same price range that fit the bill."
2.0,"The sweatshirt fits very snug, which I don't mind. The fabric is very soft and quite thin. The only downside for me is the zipper. Having problems zipping up and down. I don't expect it to last long."
2.0,Very long crotch area. Kind of look like MC Hammer pants.
2.0,Good value. You can bend them to help them stay better. Otherwise the post is little long. I don't know if it's just me but they turn my nose hole black. I haven't had that happen with the ones I buy at Claire's. That is why I gave it 2 stars. Ordered out of convenience.
2.0,"I liked the style of the shirt, but the XL was way too small.  I wear XL in all shirts that I own and I could not even get the buttons closed.  Also - the actual shirt I received is similar to the shirt pictured on amazon, but by no means is it the same shirt."
2.0,Way too small my son wears a children's place or walmart size 10. So I bought the 12-14 just in case and they wouldn't go over his thighs. The price is way high for the size of these. Pjs this small should not be more than 20 dollars. These are priced for teen or adult size but my 8 year old can't fit them. Material feels thick and heavy. Pretty soft. These would be good for winter. Just be aware of sizing. They look to fit between a size 6-8.
2.0,Way too small.  Returned it but did not get replacement because they didn’t have an xl size.  Material felt nice
2.0,Looks very cute but size ran small. Had to return it.
2.0,"Wish this style had some elastic in the back. It stretches out of shape and will not stay up. Colors were nice, but the band is not stretchy enough to stay up. I like the 3-seam turban from Hats With Heart much better. That brand has a little strip that is elasticized in the back and the medium/large in that style and brand fits my small head and offers some fullness."
2.0,"This dress was so cute and fit just fine before I washed it. After washing (and drying on extra low for a couple of minutes only), the elastic at the waist shrunk. Now it’s not comfortable and looks very unflattering. I’ve already missed the return window. What a shame. Thankfully, it wasn’t expensive. If I could return it, I certainly would."
2.0,"Hat fit nicely, but buttons were cheap, tiny, and not secured well. Returned them."
2.0,Cute BUT don’t fit too small!!
2.0,"This did not look anything like pictured and I sent it back (beware of $3 return fee).  It fit more like a men's muscle shirt with very large arm holes that barely covered my breasts.  It also fit like a half shirt barely the bottom barely came down to the waistband of my jeans, but it was very wide.  With that being said, the quality of the fabric, stitching and print were nice and therefore I still gave it 2 stars.  I had wanted this for an upcoming vacation and was disappointed.  I ended up ordering the same statement on a t-shirt from a different seller and was much happier."
2.0,Looks cheap. Only wear at night.
2.0,"The print is cute and they are comortable.  However, they are pretty thin!  I have bought a few better quality yoga pants off Amazon that were the same price or cheaper."
2.0,"I tried to like these. I purchased to replace my old Croc flip flops. These are nothing like Crocs. They are very squishy and when you are a bigger person like I am, squishy doesn't cut it. BUT if you ate looking for a cheap OOFOS replacement, these might work for you. They feel the same as them."
2.0,These are absolutely adorable but unfortunately terrible quality. They all fell apart.
2.0,"The dress fabric is polyester. The fabric is not as advertised (95% Rayon, 5% Spandex). Disappointed. The black fabric line down the front of the dress really limits the stretch of the dress. The dress is kind of see through. I'm returning it because it was too small in the hips area. I ordered an XL and I'm 5'8"", 170lbs. Wish it wasn't so tight in the hips. The tag says Dry Clean or hand wash."
2.0,The dress fit big. Daughter is a size zero and the small was too big and the quality of the dress could of been better.. sent it back for a return
2.0,"Just fit all weird, the neck was way too wide And the waist too small. I ordered the correct size, when I was able to get it over my boobs.... just not a good fit"
2.0,"Poor quality. do not buy. The elastic was already depleted by the time I got it. So, it did not fit well, secure."
2.0,"This is a very soft shirt - I really do love the material. But the letters began cracking and peeling after just one wash. Several washes in and it looks pretty crummy. I still wear it because it is so soft and because the peeling gives it a bit of a vintage look (though that's not my preference). However, given the shoddy construction, I can't recommend buying it, unfortunately."
2.0,This dress does not look the same as on the model... very frumpy.
2.0,"I really like thesex however, the little ball that you need to screw in is very tiny and hard to keep a hold of, and it fell while I was trying to screw it in and we could not find it. It came in a pair of 2. The second one, my friend was not able to screw it in either. The ball is just way too tiny. I was not able to wear these. Very disappointed but they sure do look cute."
2.0,Sent back. Didn’t fit right. Too big and too small at same time.
2.0,"While the pictures show the sloth design clearly, the product I received features a blurry design due to the fabric being quite cheap. The strap is also made from cheap fabric and is far too short to be worn across the body, even at it's longest length. While the bag looked cute online, the product received is definitely not worth the money and I will be returning it. The only positive is that the shape and size of the bag are as described."
2.0,"Disappointed the shirt was too small. It took a longer time to get here than it was suppose to. Will not order again. Will have to give it to someone else. My son in law always wears an XL, this shirt is more like a medium. Otherwise I liked the looks of the shirt."
2.0,"I ordered 10 of these bracelets as holiday gifts for my nieces.  Of the 10 ordered 4 arrived already broken (the filigree heart was split open and disconnected).  They are prettily packaged and are reasonably attrative, but you have a 2 in 5 chance of receiving a defective item based on my experience.  I am seldom disappointed by my orders with Amazon, but this takes the cake."
2.0,Two short and small.
2.0,"I loved this bag when it came in! It is the perfect size and I loved the color. However, I used it once for the gym, only had a few items in the bag, and when I got home the strap just broke while I was walking. Either I got a dud or this bag is not properly made."
2.0,"My daughter is 4 and we tried every size of this suit, she loves Bluet and it would have broke her heart to not get this suit. Every size, even the 1T was too baggy in the bottoms. When I say baggy, it was just in the but area. As if the design was off in some way.  We finally decided to just keep the 3T so she could at least have the shirt from it. Still disappointing that none of them would work."
2.0,"One if the pairs I received was a size too large. The quality is great though. I'd order more, but I'm not sure I'd get something I could actually wear."
2.0,Liner fell out the FIRST day he wore these to school - had to go back and search through the lost and found for it. HASSLE!!!<br />I had to hot glue them into place so it wouldn't happen again.  Why can't the manufacturer do that?  Do they expect kids to take them off very carefully because that's not going to happen.<br />Good I got a deal on them or they would have gone back.
2.0,I should have ordered small. The medium is way larger than expected. Had to check the inside tag for a mistake.
2.0,This dress came to me wrinkled and with a HOLE IN IT!!! Would not recommend.
2.0,I ordered two sizes larger than usual. It's still a bit small.
2.0,Impressive at first but they battery life is increasingly short. Cheaply made with glue showing. My son still loves them though.
2.0,NOT AT ALL LIKE PICTURE!  the skirt is a bunch of rough tool with no shape.  it is not sheer like the picture.  the bottom is unfinished cut.  the slit is not where its supposed to be.  i do not recommend this dress!
2.0,"I bought these gloves for PC typing, to warm my hands and also keep my skin moisturized (by wearing hand lotion during the work day under gloves to keep my keyboard clean). The fit is as I expected based on the photo, i.e. a little snug around the base of the fingers but otherwise a decent fit for my average-sized women's hands.  I was hoping they'd be reasonably soft and comfortable, but the texture of the material is quite unpleasant, so I can't stand to wear them for more than a few minutes at a time. I presume what I received are the stretch nylon version rather than the cotton unisex, but even so, they feel especially cheap and artificial and I find it too distracting.  After two days I've given up on these."
2.0,The dress was too long!! Went past my knees...definitely not what it looks like from the picture.
2.0,"Way to big for a medium,"
2.0,"Soft, adorable, great fit, but see thru ever with a slip<br /><br />5' 2.5&#34;  136"
2.0,Got these for the wife as lounge pants. She says the lining in NOT cotton and that they feel really uncomfortable and scratchy. Would not recommend.<br /><br />**Disclosure: I received a sample product from the Amazon Vine program for an honest and unbiased review of the product.
2.0,"I bought this to wear with a more expensive black crop top in Vegas. I knew I was probably only going to wear it once, so that's why I opted for this inexpensive item. It fit well and was a decent material that matched my other black clothing. But after washing it one time, the elastic woven throughout the fabric (not just the waistband) frayed at all of the seams. Therefore, I definitely cannot wear it again. $17 to me was still worth it, just be aware it doesn't really have ""lasting"" quality."
2.0,"took a long time to receive and when I finally got it, does not adjust.<br />expensive and cheaply made items. just buy a cheap magnifier type reading glasses will work better."
2.0,Size down at least 1 size!
2.0,Didn't like it after I got it....
2.0,"These are interesting pants but for someone who is 5'2"" they do not work.  Make you look shorter.<br />Because of the thin material I don't believe hemming is an option.  If you're just wearing them around the house I guess they're ok.  Also, as someone else mentioned...they are not chiffon but cotton instead!"
2.0,Really cheap looking like plastic
2.0,"The bottoms are cute, but the top is awful it has no form to it and the quality of how they sewed it was not good!"
2.0,"The material was nice but thin. The color is really nice, but I ended up giving it away to someone else as a gift."
2.0,"It came apart and broke at the connector not even 2 weeks old, it was pretty but that’s the only good I can say"
2.0,"I usually wear a 38D, but ordered this strapless in a 38C because I find that I usually have too much room in the cups of strapless bras. While the bra is very nice quality, it was HUGE. The band fit fine, but I would probably need a 38B given how big the cups were. Unsurprisingly, the bra did not stay up. Pretty bummed, especially since it was such a good price. I will have to return it."
2.0,"Have purchased other Biadani sweaters previously and have been very satisfied so I thought this one would be a good purchase as well. It’s cute, I’ll give it that, but very thin and pilled after one 6-hour wearing.  Disappointing!"
2.0,the medal did not have the quality that it should have.  The medal was completely separated form the ribbon and was not in the best of shape
2.0,poor seamstess
2.0,"The shirt looks great in photos. The shirt looks great on a hanger. However, If you are used to quality fitted men’s clothing  then this shirt will disappoint you. The sleeves poke out an don’t hug your arms. The collar is to small for western men. The trunk of the shirt fits your abdomen like a garbage bag. The shirt is NOT flattering I won’t buy another."
2.0,Runs very small. Ordered the 5-6 for our daughters birthday. The top was definitely not to size.
2.0,"im a fat guy who looks for boots to wear. I bought em and kind of wish I didn't but at the same time they where good boots until the heel started giving way and being crush by my heel and the metal bar running along the bottom to the insole. That honey comb heel has too much give and once that does the bottom of the boot started splitting open, and that is just annoying especially for a fat guy cause of the way the ankle starts to sit in them. I think it the heel was one solid piece instead of that these wouldn't have lasted me longer."
2.0,Much thinner than anticipated.  Can not read stamp on clasp.
2.0,This case is terrible. Looks nothing like the picture
2.0,its nice but find the fabric very hot. I live in the tropics
2.0,Another necklace that I worry about with my Granddaughter.
2.0,Nice color but too small since it was washed
2.0,Not even close to the posted size. Better get 2 sizes bigger than you'd normally buy.
2.0,I love the style but with my first wear the sole started falling apart. I can still wear them but I was disappointed .
2.0,"Really small, but cute."
2.0,"I ended up returning these earrings.  They were WAY too big for my earlobes.  Plus, the stones that were in it were not the little ones pictured here, they were much bigger.  It looked like costume jewelry you'd give to a 10 year old, in my opinion.  Pictures look better than real life."
2.0,"Smaller than expected, even though I ordered it one size bigger."
2.0,"Fell apart in two months, soles came off the bottom. One of the lace hooks came off right away but the wearer liked the look and fit so didn't want to return."
2.0,"It does tear when you are pulling it up. Need some improvement. I thought it was me, and ordered 2 more times and in different color. The same thing. It tears very easily"
2.0,The ring is a lot thinner than it looks in the photo.
2.0,Way tighter than i expected. Was not flattering at all.
2.0,"Way to big, its impossible to see the whole design while wearing."
2.0,Didn't really like the material of this dress.
2.0,Very beautiful necklace but came in and was missing a diamond….. very disappointed as this was a gift….
2.0,"I selected Extra Large Adults, received a child's size"
2.0,Nice soft material but SO SMALL my 11 year old can barely use it. An average sized adult certainly couldn’t. Anyone over a size 2-3 probably couldn’t get it all the way around comfortably.
2.0,"Too tight, too narrow. Not stretchy."
2.0,"Hat is not very warm. Neck is so small, it’s best used as a hand warmer. Need a battery pack if you don’t want to have to unplug to move around at all."
2.0,It doesn't go on without squeezing the crap out of your leg and even then it doesn't stay up. The design is pretty and the concept is cool but the scorpion gets twisted easily
2.0,Waaaaaayyyyy too short!
2.0,Smelled funny and had a few spots on it. I returned it.
2.0,Ordered this because of all the positive reviews but the fabric is cheap and is made poorly. It bunches up in the back and there were loose strings in the front. Returning it immediately
2.0,"Was very excited about these... I plan on returning them however. 1, they are NOT polarized. 2, they are extremely flimsy frames. Why do they cost more than $7....?"
2.0,"Its too tight, low flexibility and the fabric is not soft. I will not wear unfourtnatelly."
2.0,Says extra large but there's no way it was that size.  Way smaller.  I'd say it's actually a small in US sizes.
2.0,Very fragile. I didn't see much difference in glare reduction. Seemed to only change the color.
2.0,"Cheap. Not inexpensive,  cheap. I know it's just 10 bucks, but come on. Plastic crystal? Not even good plastic."
2.0,Cheap material and runs huge
2.0,There is no zipper or buttons or any way to keep this coat closed. Very cute but it is not practical
2.0,"It fits great, but there are no buttons on the jacket to actually let me close it. There's the two small buttons on the side and that's it. Not even buttons for the pockets, otherwise I'd just call it a design choice. Disappointed!"
2.0,"Only 1 out of the 3 pairs I purchased were the correct size I paid for. I did not want to be bothered with the return and correction so I just didn't say anything. The bag has the correct size on its label but the bras are the wrong size! I didn't notice until after I put the first one on so it was worn. Then when i checked the second color i noticed it was also wrong! I didn't wear that one and its still in the bag.  I will attach a photo to show what I'm talking about.<br /><br />It was really upsetting, especially considering my first purchase was exactly what I ordered and expected the same when ordering the exact same thing in 2 new colors.<br />I bought a bra prior to this incident and it was so comfortable that I wanted to buy 2 more in different colors. When they send you the correct product it will fit amazing and is great quality. Too bad that didnt happen this time.<br />Hopefully this is not something that happens often with their sales."
2.0,"Nice color & fabric, but my first thought when I opened them was ""did I mistakenly order child's pants?"".  I ordered a size 16 (one size up to wear thermals underneath).  Honestly they looked like like they might fit a 12 year old girl.  Maybe it was a a sizing fluke, but back to Amazon they go"
2.0,"the poofy part does not make a tail shape as pictures. And it doesn't really look like scales on the skirt either. Would not buy again. Not sure I'll ever wear this, it's tight and hard to wear."
2.0,Very tight . The wings will poke you and it broke in less then 2 weeks.
2.0,"This color is not even close to being khaki.  It is, pure and simple, ORANGE."
2.0,Bought these same boots from a different vendor. After a long wait they arrived and loved them.  Have now had 3 months and maybe wear them twice a week. The inner sole has fallen apart. Turns out it is a thin piece of cardboard covered with cloth.
2.0,"The palazzo pants were very nicely made, but because I am tall, they were a little too short for my preference. If they were a little longer they would have been perfect."
2.0,"One of the links opened during shipping (I guess) and all the charms were loose in the box.  Contacted the seller.  Although apologetic, they couldn’t do anything since it ships from Amazon.  Really didn’t want to go through the hassle of returning it.  So I put it back together based on the item photo.  Didn’t take long, just tedious.  Metal for the main necklace is pliable.  Gave all the links a squeeze for good measure.  It is a gorgeous necklace once it was back together :)"
2.0,"The dress says it's COTTON and it's NOT AT ALL. It's some type of shiny material and it's very thin, so you can see thru it."
2.0,I bought these because me and my family all have different piercings. I put one in my Ashley (bottom lip) it broke in 3 days my daughter has a belly piercing her ball also broke in less then a week. Some of them didn’t have both ends and some were stripped. But you get what you pay for🤷🏽‍♀️ My sisters tongue ring is holding up so so far
2.0,The size chart is way off.  I normally wear an XL but got a 2X since the reviews said it runs small. I couldn’t even get the thing on!  My 12 yr old daughter wears a medium and it fit her perfectly around but unfortunately she hasn’t filled out in the cup size area yet so I’ll have to see if I can return it.  It’s also somewhat difficult to hook in the back as it has to go over your head because of the crisscross straps. Other that the massive size issue it appears to be well made. The stitching is decent quality and it’s padded under the breast kind of like a mild push up bra. The pads on the one I got are sewn in but some of the reviews say they are removable so I’m not sure what’s up there.
2.0,Too much money for the product. The idea is good but not worth what I paid for it.
2.0,Very cute but the side seam ripped after wearing once
2.0,Cute bag but broke after 3rd use
2.0,"They were cute, small earrings. I really liked them. But the post broke off of the back of one earring after one day’s wear. Not durable at all. I chucked them."
2.0,The picture showed the dress loosely fit. The actual dress is straight and form fitting.
2.0,Size Not fit for adult
2.0,Very cute but I wish these felt tighter on the head. They slip off so easily...
2.0,"Ordered a men’s 2x and that’s not what these were. They say that but in reality these are like a juniors large. I couldn’t even get my leg in one side lol only reason I gave it two stars is bc material was good. I gave these to my 12 year old daughter to wear bc they fit her instead, so that should show u what I mean about the sizing being way off"
2.0,"Quality was just so-so.  While the price was great, you get what you paid for...  I was very disappointed"
2.0,"These fit nice and I was excited because I can never find shorts that fit nice that aren't covered in holes. But within the first hour that I wore these, the button came off. I am very disappointed in the defect."
2.0,"Not worth the price, and runs very small!"
2.0,"I wanted to like this coat. It’s warm and fuzzy but too frumpy on me. I got a small, I’m 5’1” and 120lbs, it’s too baggy and bulky on the bottom. Will be returning, boo!"
2.0,Not bad but very small and not shines as a picture
2.0,"Returned this product, as it was too small,, to the shipper as instructed, its been over 11 days, and no refund or credit.  Shipper will not respond to any of my three emails.  Do not recommend purchases from this business at all."
2.0,The sweater is super cute but you'll need to order up two sizes for sure.
2.0,Was not happy with material or size runs small
2.0,I could buy better shoes at the Dollar Store. I do not recommend.
2.0,Thinner than I thought. Looks cheaper than how it’s portrayed in the picture
2.0,Fits small. Probably won't wear it out of the house but it's okay as a type of robe.
2.0,"I ordered a extra large and glad that I did, it's still too small for the fit I wanted.  Too tight around in sleeves and cannot button w/o feeling uncomfortable.  I'm a small person 5'6""  115 lbs  and ordered a extra large.  It's almost too small.  Don't buy this product"
2.0,"Husband didn’t even try in. Arrived so wrinkled and mis- shaped, it would need professional pressing to wear. The quality of jacket did not warrant additional expense."
2.0,"The style is very cute and the fit ok, but the quality of the underwear is poor."
2.0,Thinner than expected and just looked weird on me.  Somehow made my legs look fatter than they are.
2.0,Some of the earrings were nice but one arrived broken.
2.0,"The colours are nothing like the picture it was mostly orange and earth tones, not anywhere near the colours, this is the reason I purchased it, was severely disappointed"
2.0,came today - purchased XL it's more like a medium...it's not off the shoulder like the picture - more just wide necked and the lips are not red more of an orangy-pink. Should've known better...ugh.
2.0,Would be fine if it weren't on the small side.
2.0,"This is just a regular shirt, not a crop top."
2.0,They are okay but fall off too much.
2.0,Super cute but this is my first day to wear it and basically just have been traveling today but ended up with snags all over the front. Very disappointed as I won’t be wearing it again because if you cut them off the material is so thin I feel like it would shred.
2.0,"tiny.  these are tiny.  I wear them in my second pierced hole further up my ear, they would be excellent for a child but only barely fit around my lobe.  stones are very small also and almost not noticeable except I made the effort to see if stones were in them. Not a great find."
2.0,Way to big and lenses are bad
2.0,One size fits all.  They sent me XXL. It was huge on me
2.0,"The arms are super tight and body looks no where similar to photo. It's much more slim. A snap also broke off... It sounds like I ordered a size too small, but I promise I didn't!"
2.0,Ripped on the back part im so upset i wanted to go out now im going to have to pay someone to fix it
2.0,"Per Dr's orders, I wear compression socks. Nearly all the ones I  have/had are Fytto brand. I have a pair of Nuvein I liked (others didn't fit so well) and I tried some Solimo which I LOVED but then after wearing for a while they were just too tight right under the knees.<br />So now to LOLLOP. These are a fun design and you could wear these and people would think they are socks. They are much thicker than ALL my other compression socks. Unfortunately for me there's just next to no compression.<br />These (not worn--from the pack) measure 10 inches around. so I pulled out  a brand new pair of Fytto for comparison and they measure about 8 1/2 inches around the top.<br />I tried M/L which according to the manufacturer should be ok. I wear size 9 (or 9 1/2 depending on manufacturer shoe). My calf measures 14 inches around. JUst under the knee my leg measures about 13 inches if that helps.<br />There's stretch here in the LOLLOP socks, but I would have to have MUCH bigger legs for them to even begin to stretch.<br />There's just no compression here for me. Perhaps a s/m would have been better but according to the size chart, they would not have fit my foot size."
2.0,Not soft at all and colors not vibrant..sucks
2.0,Not impressed with the material nor the color. Not as pictured.
2.0,This ring is better for a nostril piercing not septum because you can't see the colors or design
2.0,"Dress is pretty on the model, but on a more curvy woman, the stomach area is just not flattering, felt and looked like I was 6 months pregnant."
2.0,Horrible fit.  Material is very thin and not as described.  Returning these.
2.0,The green threads of the tassel was falling off the earrings non stop. will not purchase again
2.0,"La foto muestra algo de mejor calidad, la realidad es que es delgado."
2.0,Not what I expected. You’d really have to be “the right person” to pull this off.
2.0,"I'm 5'11"" 175LB and a medium fits me like a blanket. Not sure when medium became 6'4"" 250 Lbs.<br /><br />Other than that I'm sure its fine."
2.0,"I bought this dress for the 4th of July and was not very satisfied. I purchased a large and felt this ran pretty tiny! Plus, if you are curvy at all, this will not work, there is no stretch and it runs kind of short  (I am only 5' 3&#34; and it barely touched my ankles)."
2.0,The front pocket zipper broke the day I used it.<br />I only put a small pack of hand wipes and it broke
2.0,"Does not fit my glasses, might be OK if it did. All these Solar Shield clip-on lenses appear only to fir smaller frames. Sizing guidance at the site are not useful in selecting lens."
2.0,ok.. shouldn't be listed as acceptable for lacrosse
2.0,I should have just packed a real rain jacket.  These were very flimsy.  I tried to tighten the hood and the string came out.  After 3 hours of wear the seam along the arm ripped.  Okay for the price.
2.0,Mucho se nuebo
2.0,"Giving a 2 star review because the size chart in the pictures can't be correct. I have a 40 inch chest so I ordered the small based on the size chart, even though I usually wear a L or XL. I got the dress and couldn't even button the first button."
2.0,"The leggings fit my legs, and while I didn't expect them to be high waisted, they didn't even come up over my hips."
2.0,"This was not the ideal costume. The shirt was too small, the dress part too big. The shirt has velcro instead of a zipper. I had to alter every part of this costume. NOT worth the money. It was made very cheaply."
2.0,They are too itchy .....
2.0,"Ordered xxl.....fits much more like a large in the United States. Wish it fit, I like the style."
2.0,"It fit ok, and the fabric was soft and comfortable. However, the placement of the pockets is not flattering AT ALL. It made me look huge through the hips, and it was a deal breaker."
2.0,not a fan of this chain
2.0,Not as cute and looks cheap
2.0,Cute selection BUT Three out of eight of the necklace pendants are not what you see on the screen. I’m very disappointed as I really wanted this particular style in the colors shown on the screen. The circles and Triangles and solo long leaf Are the opposite color of what you see.  instead of silver it should be gold and vice versa. Just Beware for anyone ordering !
2.0,"Too small for my car's cup holder, it is not absorbent as advertise."
2.0,"This dress is very casual (despite how dressy it looks in the photo).  The fabric is a stretchy t-shirt type material...not really acceptable for prom.  Also, runs small"
2.0,Fit right at the top and you can see through it. Cute dress but poor material.
2.0,Is not true to size. Runs small.
2.0,"Its tiny ! The shield doesn't even go to my chin , and if you wear glasses forget it it won't go down over them . But on the plus side it seems well made (for a child )"
2.0,"I liked the look of the bracelet,  for the 36 hours I had to wear it. The clasp was not secure and the bracelet came off the 2nd day I wore it."
2.0,I was very disappointed in this bodysuit. I had to end up giving it away.
2.0,Very pretty but does not easily lay flat. The bib portion of the necklace comes in two parts. One often folds under the other.
2.0,"Was so excited the skirt was long enough ( I am 6'0), but it was SO thin, there is no way you could actually wear it in public as a maxi skirt unless you had a slip or another layer underneath. Completely see through. Returned item."
2.0,The biggest charm I love you to the moon and back kept falling off. This last time wasn’t able to locate it to put it back on the braclet. No problems with the smaller charms .
2.0,Was nice just runs small.
2.0,"I gave these a star for being cute, but they're scratchy and thin and really uncomfortable. I would have returned them except for apparently there are no returns for these. Buyer beware."
2.0,Daughter was so excited for these but after a lot of falling down they are in the closet. She hasn’t touched them since.
2.0,The style and look were great. unfortunately the wood frame was broken when i got it and returned it. never ordered again.
2.0,"Gets very bally, looks very old after a few washes.  On the other hand very comfy."
2.0,"This surely wasn't what I would expect from Land's End.  Constructed of slippery, felt-like, thin fabric that feels like it's embossed in chemicals.  I could do better at the Dollar General."
2.0,Chain broke 2 nd day if wearing it
2.0,"As soon as my son tried a pair on the croch split. Fabric is stiff, might loosen up in wash but not going to wait and find out."
2.0,"Very cute earrings, but they did not match when I received them.  I returned them for a replacement.  The replacement pair did not even make it through one day of wearing them.  One of the tiered tassels fell off."
2.0,Im 5'3 & 125 pounds. I ordered a large. It was a tad too small. The top was made with a cheap clip. It kept coming undone.
2.0,"With an overall rating of 3.5 stars, I was hoping for more but I reminded myself that this necklace was $9 and looks it ."
2.0,Feels very cheap and does not fit as low on the neck as it shows in the second photo
2.0,It runs small and the material doesn't stretch at all..... Cute though!
2.0,Does not give any support and it is quite thick.  It moves around inside my brass.
2.0,"too bulky, can't do anything with them on, but they keep your hands warm"
2.0,"Im a large always and this item was a medium, medium! Fabric is nice and fresh,very nice for summer time!,  print is very nice so I am going to return it and try the XXL. I am not posting a picture for obvious reasons, it didn't fit."
2.0,Fit was okay except it came up way too high in the neck. It felt like it was chocking me. I also didn't realize the pom poms were neon colors until receiving it. Not for me.
2.0,"The band is too short, so I had to return it. I forgot to measure it before I wrapped it up, but the band on my husband's old Casio which broke the other day measures 10&#34; from end to end. This one was short of that enough so that it couldn't be fastened."
2.0,The fit was great and very cute BUT the item arrived with a tear.
2.0,too large the size small
2.0,"That is strange but the black one fits bigger, the grey obe fits good, alyough bith are midium size"
2.0,"Slightly smaller than all my other XL shirts, but still fits. I wouldn’t order a size up unless your current size is a little snug.<br /><br />One of the arms is slightly tighter than the other. I was unable to wear this for more than 2 mins. Please see the attached photo for reference.<br /><br />I’m assuming this is just a defect with the shirt I ordered. I am returning."
2.0,"It would be a much higher rating, except that the material on the sides of the bra is so rough that it litterally hurts the underside of my arms and my sides when I move. Very disapointed"
2.0,"Regular photos winter fit if you want to have use the cover to protect the photo. The photo thickness must be paper thin to fit easily into the keychain. Also you must remove the default image that is on the plastic piece that protects the photo, it's not super hard to remove but it doesn't come off easily either. It took some effort and I gave up getting the little dots completely off out of frustration."
2.0,Product looks good but the magnet was weak. Hard to keep on during the day.
2.0,"I ordered a small. I am 5'3&#34; and 130 lbs. 32&#34; bra size and size 4/6. This top is not long enough even on my short frame and too wide across the chest. It measures 20&#34; from armpit to atmpit. If i were to tailor it, I'd need probably 2&#34; on either side taken in . Cute top just not right at all for my body."
2.0,"Beyond miniature and the stone was almost non-existent, you need a magnifying glass to find it, 2 thumbs down"
2.0,"Slim enough, I guess, but wider than expected as well. Not sure I'll be keeping this, takes up more space than I'd like to. The upside to this is I didn't pay very much for the item, and won't feel much guilt if I don't actually use it."
2.0,Legs were different length by several inches.
2.0,Alot of the viles came broken from the stems of the glass flower. Overall beautiful but had broken pieces.
2.0,You can tell this was personally made. It was done alright
2.0,So these glasses sit very high on on my face. The angle they sit at leaves a big gap between your cheeks and the glasses.
2.0,"I am really shocked, this watch was opened before and one of the bracelets was scratched!"
2.0,Too dim to see the time unless the led button is pressed each time.
2.0,Broke 1st day I wore it to work....in a pharmacy tech so my jobs not hard on my clothes or jewelry.
2.0,Way too small. I have been getting the 3-4 for her on other leotards routinely and they never fit this small. As soon as you take it out of the package it stands out about how small it is. It could fit a large baby doll. No good!!
2.0,Hat was too big
2.0,"This is a fine wallet. It holds your cards and money... My biggest issue is that the design of the wallet causes strain on your cards, so when you sit down, the cards are all bending more than any wallet I've had in the past. I recently got this wallet and my cards are already showing where they'll crack. I'm trying to move the cards around so they have different points of pressure so they'll hopefully not break as quickly. I'm guessing there's a better designed wallet that is still RFID.<br /><br />* updated review: I had to discontinue use of this wallet because my cards were beginning to be unusable with the cracks from the pressure. It might be the stiffeners I read they used, but whatever the reason, it makes this wallet unusable for me. That sucks!!! I bought a front pocket wallet to protect my cards and it is WAY slimmer and overall better. Definitely a disappointment after only a few months of use and I had to buy a new wallet. Redesign please!"
2.0,I had it dry cleaned every time i wanted to clean it. but the zipper broke after wearing it 3 times.
2.0,"Not as vibrant,..wish it had more colour .was a bit disappointed ."
2.0,"I was excited to find this band. I love sugar skulls<br /><br />What I got looks nice. But, it came with a bunch of marks all over it.<br /><br />I wouldn't recommend buying from this seller. Quality control obviously doesn't exist. Quite disappointing!"
2.0,"It is too big than I expect.it is red not yellow like the picture.when I received, it was not ok missing one stone."
2.0,it was smaller than expected
2.0,I am a medium; I’ve always been a medium. So I ordered a medium. Well the sleeves end halfway up my forearms and there is no way it hits my thigh as pictured. It hits at my waist! Too bad because the knitting is nice.
2.0,"The ""joggers"" fit far more like leggings. I actually ended up cutting out the thick elastic waistband in them which helped give them a bit more of the cute snug jogger look.<br />The top makes me look like a stuffed sausage. I have an hourglass shape, wear size 6 jeans, and am pretty chesty. Honestly, it fits me more like a long sleeved sports bra. Thankfully a smaller friend was able to take it but still, super disappointed.<br />I'll give it one thing though- I love the fabric- Breathable and super comfy."
2.0,Super cute .. Good Fit.. BUTT!! It came with a huge whole .. returning it for a full refund
2.0,the car is a little chunky for my liking not best with small nose piercings.
2.0,"All six headbands were in a small package.  I doubted they would fit my huge head but I thought i would try..  They are little tight at first but after a bit they stretch and feel pretty good.  I just got these but so far I am really happy with the purchase.  ......<br />update:<br />Well,seem is coming out already, It doesn't last long , well I got 5 more I guess.."
2.0,Loved the style but the size is way off. I ordered a large and to me this was a small..or should I say extra small..not happy..
2.0,Difficult to place thru my ears
2.0,"Does not hold up well.  This is the 2nd one I bought (3rd strap if you count the one it came with). First one split, second one the pin broke.  This was all in less than 1 year."
2.0,These water shoes fit perfectly. But they have only been worn once and are already coming apart. Very disappointed the kids loved the sharks on them.
2.0,"You know those flimsy sunglasses you get at the gas station for $8? The ones that look pretty cool in the tiny mirror on the revolving display, and you know that they are definitely going to break in under a month but you buy them anyway because they only cost $8?<br /><br />These are those sunglasses but selling for $45. I dig the concept of using all recycled plastic, and that they're a startup...and hey, they are some great looking and fitting sunglasses. But they are every bit as flimsy as those $8 shades from the gas station. I hope they hold up, because I like them, but I'm not holding my breath. I just wish I would have held onto $37 and gone with the ones from the gas station."
2.0,Just didn’t fit my body right in waist nor chest . Better for tall and skinny or real petite
2.0,"Way too small!  I am the exact same size at the &#34;model&#34; they describe in the description of the jeans- Let me tell you,  the &#34;size&#34; they said that model is and the size of pants she is &#34;wearing&#34;...NO!  Not accurate! I am 5'9 and 135lbs.  I ordered the jeans in size small- because that is what the model that has the EXACT same measurements as me is wearing.  I get the jeans and I try them on...OMG...let me tell you...it did NOT look pretty!  I could barely pull them up my legs.  When I did finally get them up, I couldn't even button them because the button and the hole weren't even coming close together.  After much sucking and squeezing, I did finally button them, I was seriously scared that the button might pop off.  I mean, this company should just be honest about the sizes and measurements.  I looked like a grown adult trying on little toddlers clothes.  Lol.  For real.  It was a terrible experience.  Hilarious.  But terrible."
2.0,The product did not state when buying it could not be placed in a dryer. More information would be helpful.
2.0,"The overalls that I received are cute but not as pictured.  The pleats in the front are very flat, the legs aren't as wide and flowy either."
2.0,"These bows are cute, but have sharp, pointy ends on the clip that aren't covered to protect babies & small children from getting hurt! Not sure if I'll keep them for when my daughter is older or if I will return them and get my money back. They were also definitely over priced for the value."
2.0,"Will be returning. I'm 5'4'', 140 lbs and these barely go over my knee. I wanted thigh highs, more like the advertised picture. The material is not very stretchy or soft, making them very uncomfortable. The colors are also off."
2.0,I like the color and I thought if I got a large it would fit but I need an extra large.
2.0,its doesnt has F selection i can only set the speed :(
2.0,"Very nice looking, very stylish and great for a light sweater.  BUT...it is cheaply made.  When it arrived the bottom of the zipper was already detached from the sweater.  After only a short time, the sweater started to unravel.  It started on the bottom and then the left sleeve started to unravel.  In a short period of time, the thread pulled all the way back up the sleeve rendering the sweater useless.  Overall, a poor buy."
2.0,"I wore these during a hot half Ironman this past weekend. They did work, kept my arms cooler and sunburn free. However upon washing them (for the first time) the hems came completely unraveled."
2.0,"Looks lovely online but the silver part came with black streaks and a mottled appearance.  Tried to shine it with a jewelry cloth but instead of shine, now the ring is dull.  You get what you pay for.  I gave it 2 stars because it is cute and fits correctly and came in a nice little box."
2.0,Sad to say these are not 1 inch clip buckles smh very misleading and disappointing
2.0,"I gave this one 2 stars due to the fact that the neck style on this one didn’t fit correctly as the other Viscose turtlenecks I purchased. I noticed the inside tag color was black. I think this one was old stock? The other colors I’ve purchased was a white tag. I had to return this. The color was great, and still soft."
2.0,"I bought these for my boyfriend for Christmas, because it seemed to meet all the criteria I was looking for for a slipper for him (lining, hard sole, loafer/mocassin style, menory foam, etc). When they arrived today, I opened them up to inspect before wrapping them to put under the Christmas tree. I was very disappointed when I opened the package. They were pretty smushed from its confining packaging, but upon inspection the two shoes looked completely different. The overall shape and stitching varied between the shoes and the actual fit varied as well (one fit like a true 9 and the other more like a 10). I immediately started the return process, and attempted to give the product a second chance hoping mine was a dud, but the style and size were unavailable. I'm very disappointed."
2.0,"Wore once, very thin material. If your large busted, you will struggle with the buttons, so I had to sew my buttons shut so they didn't pop open! Washed once as directed and dress fell apart and shrunk majorly. Would not recommend."
2.0,"This sweatshirt is very small fitting, ordered a large. It is not sweatshirt fabric, it is actually see through.. very cheaply made."
2.0,They are uncomfortable
2.0,"Update: after washing it was not same and I washed it as untrusted so I was disappointed. Inalei found another in just like it on amazon for half of the price!!<br /><br />I love this! I haven’t washed it yet so I’ll update, but so far it is much warmer than I expected and it’s sooo soft. I hope it stays this way after washing. I’m 5’1 and 155lbs and a medium fit was perfect if you want a little loose fit"
2.0,"I have been wearing British Army style assault/patrol boots since 1997. This would be my 4th or 5th pair. Every pair before, regardless of manufacturer, has been of a solid, consistent quality that always felt comfortable to wear. Sadly, this pair by Highlander misses the mark.<br /><br />First let me say that Military 1st, who supplied my order, is a great company and is always my first choice when it comes to purchasing military surplus. The boots shipped from the UK and arrived on my doorstep in Alabama in under a week. No complaints there. Now on to the boots...<br /><br />I noticed a difference in weight as soon as I picked the box up. The boots I'm used to are quite heavy, and these were so light they had me wondering if the wrong item had shipped.<br /><br />On opening the box, I noticed straight away that the leather uppers and rubber sole are of lower quality than previous pairs I've owned. The leather seemed thinner and had a weird texture that I found difficult to polish. The rubber sole seemed plasticky like the soles of cheap tennis shoes you find at Walmart.<br /><br />I've worn the boots to work for 2 days now. They aren't terrible. Just okay. At first the boots seemed way too large, as if the top of the upper is way taller than they should be. The sides bow out when I walk because the leather is not stiff at all. The soles occasionally slip on the carpet. I don't think they'd cause me to slip over at a walk, but I wouldn't trust them at running speeds. For these reasons, and the fact that this pair gives my favorite boot a bad rep, I can only award 2 stars.<br /><br />These look like the boots I'm used to, but sadly they are just a cheap copy. I hope Military 1st will find a better manufacturer for these boots, as I'd still like to continue wearing this style. For now, I've ordered some Belleville boots, and I plan to give these naff impostor boots to a charity shop."
2.0,Not made very well. Fell apart with the first wash
2.0,The fit was a little ackward
2.0,Very cute but didn’t last for long. Started tearing.
2.0,These are great cheap goggles but only for kids who are not too active with them. We have gone thru 3 pair in 3 weeks because the plastic on the enclosure keeps breaking off.
2.0,"I like the texture, BUT the pants fit extremely weird. Tight at the lower and upper leg but way too loose in the belly area. Also give you a terrible camel toe. Returning. Ordered a small"
2.0,The graphic was peeled and looks smudged the fit was great for everything but the shoulder straps and leg straps I got a large and I’m 5’9 150lbs
2.0,The zippers on these things are tiny. The zipper gets hung up 1/2 way up the boot when I try to zip it. Spend a little more and buy something with a larger zipper.
2.0,"These are nice glasses but they are very fragile.  They fell off my head and landed on my garden's dirt (not concrete, just soft dirt) and the frame snapped."
2.0,Ok for lounging around. Wouldn’t wear in public.
2.0,"Didn't work for me. I bought the strap for my Oakley sunglasses. It slides on the glasses easily and I love the color and pattern but the strap doesn't lay flat, it sticks out the back of my head. I can't use it."
2.0,They are supposed to be anti fog with the little tabs that come up under glasses. They were just regular ones and they were more expensive than other regular ones I have purchased from other companies.
2.0,"I'm 5'5 150lbs and wear a medium top. I ordered a medium and the top of the sleeve was very small. Once I had it on, I couldn't move my arms. Otherwise a cute shirt, nice material but definitely runs small."
2.0,Fit more like a bikini than a brief
2.0,These bands were the same size as the original wide band that came on my Apple Watch. Sent back immediately. Incorrectly described!!!
2.0,"These came within 2 days, and based on some other reviews and to be safe I ordered a size up, instead of L I got an XL and they were huuuge. Also the material is a like the cheap thick mesh-y material...idk how else to describe it."
2.0,Comes to small -- if someone  orders-- I think you need to go one size up
2.0,"I wore the first day and one side snapped off so I had to tie the strap, wore the 2nd day and the other side snapped off, had to tie the strap again. The one saving grace is that with just one side snapped off the suction still worked, but when the other side snapped too, it leaked; returning product."
2.0,"The dress was true to size and appeared elegant on the picture, but the lining fabric was super cheap :("
2.0,its see trough
2.0,The size was too small and much shorter than expected. Colors true to photo.
2.0,Top heavy ladies... don't bother. The top button will absolutely not button unless you want the large whole between buttons that we are all too use to.
2.0,For the money it’s OK but it feels very cheaply made
2.0,Large around the waist and not as long as described. I'm 5&#34;10 and it didn't come close to the floor. Looks pretty cheap...
2.0,the fabric is not as great quality as expected.  I returned it.
2.0,they are ok - i bought 2 different pairs - my son 15yr old loves em - idk of i would choose to buy them again -
2.0,"Poor quality, terrible stitching"
2.0,I have never had a chipped tooth in my whole life!!! I was eating when the ball came loose and I bit down on the bar. $8 for a chipped tooth! Yay!! Ball can stay on for a day or so then fall off multiple times a day. I was really hoping for these to be better! Quality of the bar seems nice and the length is decent. Still can't get over a chipped tooth!!
2.0,"3 broke within the first few weeks. Majority are NON ADJUSTABLE and are way to big, even for my thumb. only about 4 are adjustable."
2.0,"it is gradient kind lenses, and has daytime tint (amber) on the top,  yellow tint in the middle and clear on bottom.<br /><br />Not really suitable for driving due to forcing you to bend your head down to use daytime (top) tint.<br /><br />Manufacturer should remove this product or describe difference tinting (reference middle of the len/middle of eye at relaxed, neck, bending neck positions.)"
2.0,I ordered these and was really excited but these sunglasses were huge -- both in width but also the frames and lenses themselves were so big that they really overwhelmed my face. I'm very sad to be returning these sunglasses
2.0,I normally wore a medium but I ordered a large and it fit like a small.
2.0,"Beautiful in principle.<br />One turner won't after 1 year , it grinds so is turned off.<br />Neither will keep Rolex, Breitling, nor Stuhrling watches wound, One can count on them stopping. The turners all turn, (x one , see above)<br />Still use them to store, show the watches."
2.0,The opening to fit over your nose pad is too large and they fall off easily.  Also they don’t look good because they are so big.
2.0,Too big for anyone under 5'8&#34;.
2.0,Not really worth the price
2.0,I like the colors. But the socks tend to come down the knees as you walk and material coming out after first wear.
2.0,Runs Big and  SHORT not happy with this and Poor construction so be so short on a lean built 5' 10 man raise your arms and your mid section is exposed
2.0,"The necklace is MUCH thinner than what is represented in the picture. Not being a jeweler, it's hard to determine the actual size of a chain by the written description.  The picture was obviously magnified as the chain is barely adequate for a child to wear.  I purchased this intending to use it for an adult's Christmas gift; I am instead waiting to decide if I can use it for a child's gift and if not, I plan to return this item. Very disappointing!"
2.0,The fact that they stated I can use the gloves while operating my phone is false. I tried several times to not have them work. I even tried different fingers. I also ran water onto the gloves themselves and the water actually absorbed into the glove. I didn’t give it time to see if it penetrated all the way through it it definitely went through the first layer.
2.0,"Definitely mid-sized. I normally always order large and everything fits fine. This top I couldn't even,get over my head."
2.0,"I like the shirt and the quality is good for the price, but it runs way too small. I ordered my normal size and after receiving it I wish I would have sized up 2 more sizes."
2.0,Odd/ ill-fitting dress the pic makes it look like its a wide split but when its only it looks weird. i ended up returning this dress. Its an odd fit on me -my measurements are 34DD-29waist - 39hips
2.0,Thank You .
2.0,I'm a 34 triple D so this made me look like a tent and boxy. I wish it was more in on the waist so I'm giving it 2 stars. It's cute but not for women with large breasts.
2.0,Nice watch but very hard to read do to the texture of the dial.
2.0,Some of the wands bend very easily and they are flat not round.
2.0,Broke in 2 weeks. Sad kids
2.0,"Runs extremely small! I normally wear a medium, but purchased a large because I wanted it a little “baggy”. It is so small I had to wear a shirt under it so it wasn’t showing skin and was so tight it wasn’t comfortable to wear. Material is thicker soft, but doesn’t have a lot of stretch. I did follow the sizing chart as well."
2.0,"OK... So I had them for about a week. I wanted to give them an honest try before I ended up needing to send them back.<br /><br />Pro's:<br />Has support<br />Has a back so your feet don't slide out (very helpful if you have stairs in your house or don't want to always have your toes try to hold your shoe on)<br /><br />Con's:<br />Too wide (my feet sloshed side to side in them by about 1/2&#34; or more and I almost rolled my ankle several times. Not safe)<br />Toes just fit as long as I did not wear a thick socks (tried a thinker sock to help with the wide width of them but then my toes pushed up too far)<br />The velcro on the boot is not seated in the right position to allow for a tighter fit around the ankles<br /><br />The biggest issue I had...that ultimately had me return these was the width being too wide. Rolling my ankles and injuring them is not worth keeping them. I could have lived with the other con's stated above, but they were not safe for me to wear."
2.0,It’s smaller then I expected.. it’s cute and no it does not have the original logo. It took FOREVER to arrived!!!
2.0,"I ordered an XL. Came as a 1X, it said women's plus, but the size stated XL. Very disappointed!"
2.0,My regular size was way too small. Otherwise looked like it would be a cute dress
2.0,Was cute for 4 days of gentle use on my purse. Then the flowers fell off one at a time the next 3 days until nothing was left. Super disappointed because it looked cute on my purple kate spade bag.
2.0,"way to to long and i am 5'8&#34;  and thin, sent back"
2.0,They are cute but so itchy and run really small
2.0,"This mask is beautiful, but it's a horrible size. It will squeeze the hell out of your face. I desperately tried to make this mask work, I cut the chin strap off and trimmed around the eyes. You really have to tinker with this mask if you really want it to work. Other than that, it's very pretty. You will be the center of attention with this mask."
2.0,Small up size
2.0,Don't fit my glasses.  Will be giving these away.  Maybe a good Christmas present.
2.0,"Rather than a volleyball-playing teen, I am a senior male. I've found that in the last year or so, ever since I lost some weight, my knees rub together uncomfortably when I sleep, which sometimes wakes me up. (Specifically, the medial epicondyles of my humeri and tibias bump against each other). So when I go to sleep now I put a blanket, towel or scarf between my knees, but this often falls off when I move in my sleep. The solution is knee warmers. Unfortunately these are one-size-fits-all, and even though my knees aren't that fat these are rather tight and uncomfortable."
2.0,These are not secure. One falls off my shoe but the other one stays put. I wear these to wedding rehearsals when I wear my black flats. I spend 90% of the time either picking up the buckle off the floor or looking down at my feet to make sure it's still there 🙃
2.0,It's really pretty hot its huge! The arms didnt light up at all. Bummer.
2.0,These were so tight and hurt so bad that I can not even wear these.  The are cute but just not right. A waste of money.
2.0,"Sorry to be a downer, but I didn't like these. I do love the material, but it's too flimsy and there's spillage. Also it's too tall. And there IS a seam in front, it's just not stitched, it's glued or welded, taped, whatever, but it divides the boys and makes for a weird fit. The seam connecting the front and the back is in the perfectly wrong spot also."
2.0,"The quality of the gloves is poor and it didn't take me long to see that I made a mistake getting them. They don't fit larger hands very well and I don't think the stitching will last with heavy usage.  I have about a medium hand and they don't fit very well. The two finger-holes on each glove barely fit so if you have larger hands, beware and forget trying to wear these over another glove like I was hoping to. The tiny little light bulbs or LEDs are unprotected besides the glass/plastic clear covering. It doesn't seem like it would take much to break one. The gloves are all black except for a white area where the battery is that says on/off in black lettering and an oval of white. To change the battery, you have to unscrew a screw. The velcro isn't sewn on very well. I think the idea of a glove that can illuminate where you're working is great, but the execution and quality on these is abysmal."
2.0,"This item is not like what being sold years ago.  Only one key is shipped instead of the normal 2 keys that are provided for door locks, padlocks, motor vehicles, etc.  A cheap plastic lock is used instead of the older metal-style locks; so, why need a key at this point.  It has 2 wheels built in to the bottom.  Wheels may work for some suitcases but will they hold up well for the heavier load that a footlocker would normally hold for going to college.  The item is made of a material that is not as strong as the older styles.  There should really be a good handle on each side of the footlocker for carrying purposes instead of just one on the non-wheel side.  I know after one year of use, I'll either have repairs to do or replace it with another one.  This is one of the things where older ideas beat out newer ideas."
2.0,"Al principio pensé que había recibido dos zapatos del mismo pie, así lucia! Un zapato ajustaba mas que otro y la costura de un zapato es diferente color a la del otro. Material no tan bueno, a solo dos horas de uso la correa se reventó y el zapato se peló."
2.0,"The fabric of this dress was way to rough and caused my skin to itch at its feel. The fit was loose on the body but tight on the shoulders. the only reason it gets two stars is because it does look nice. However, the discomfort it causes and the poor fitting make it not worth it."
2.0,"These do NOT look like the pic, which is a boho-look. These are a cheap-looking version of the pic they show you. For a minute I thought I’d ordered off Wish, these are that cheap-looking. I gave it two stars because at least they are wearable even though they look so awfully cheap."
2.0,i think that the material is very thick and not comfortable at all. The size is not true to fit according to other tanks I have bought.
2.0,"El color no es el mismo, es un azul más intenso, compre el XL y corre como si fuera S, a mi hija le sirvió."
2.0,Day 3 it broke
2.0,"These glasses are being sold as &#34;RXable prescription glasses&#34;.  The optician said they are not prescription glasses & he could not fit new lenses in them.  If you don't have to change lenses, they seem OK for the price."
2.0,Attractive and reasonable price but posts tall/thick and not comfortable
2.0,"Disappointed. I ordered these for my 8 year old son for Christmas. They shipped very fast, 3 or 4 days. I knew they were not the best quality but my son really wanted them & hey they did look cool. They came in a busted up box, but stuff happens. They are pretty much what appear in the description, Except the part where it describes deformed shoe lace rings with sharp metal can & will probably cut your child's foot. Have to send them back, unnecessary hassle.  LED shoes are still pretty cool!"
2.0,Did not come with T-BAR extension. I was looking forward to using this with my quick release helmet.
2.0,It looks great. I was very happy with the look and it feels durable. I guess it is cheaply made because the spring just popped out after 2 months of use.
2.0,"I am not sure why I thought this case would be hard sided. It is not. It is very flimsy, essentially a fabric envelope that barely holds two pairs of glasses and the end is open so if you go to the beach or throw it into a diaper bag any crumbs, sand or debris can easily get in the case and scratch your lenses."
2.0,I ordered sz_2 50 pack and the picture shows animals and objects that kids would like. Picture of what I received is with my review not at all what was pictured that I thought I was getting.
2.0,"There are several things that make up a digital watch, this tries to be everything and more but comes up short in my opinion. Let me explain...<br /><br />I was looking for a digital watch that was durable, not cheap, easy to read and functional with some features that a digital watch offers like a stop watch and an easy to ready interface. I got everything I asked for but in a mediocre package.<br /><br />For starters the analog arms serve no function except to block the digital displays every hour at some point, something is blocked... the time, the date, they just didn't need to be there. If I wanted a watch with arms, I'd wear my Tissot or Omega SM Deville.<br /><br />Next up, the light. I hope you like reading the analog dial at night when you light it up with its mono yellow led light built in underside at 6 pm that lights up nothing of value. I've seen $20 dollar watches with indeglo that do a better job lighting up the display from behind allowing you to read the information you want off the watch. With this model you shouldn't really play on using it at nighttime, flat out its awful. The light also stays on for less than 2 seconds and you can't hold it down to stay on.<br /><br />Maybe I'm being picky, but it's a watch for a specific purpose, nothing more.<br /><br />Cons: expensive for what it is, bad nighttime light, useless at night, analog arms block the digital readouts, no indeglow<br /><br />Pros: lots of color options, seems durable, comfortable strap, cleans up easy.<br /><br />I'll probably end up returning it, Casio is a good brand honestly, this watch is just badly designed."
2.0,Dress is very cute and fit me well but very poorly made.  Both straps broke within 10 minutes of wearing it.
2.0,I'm a small and 5'4 1/2&#34; and this dress was way too short. About 3 inches too short with flat feet! Advice: Don't buy this dress unless you are under 5'2&#34; :-(
2.0,The shirt is nice and felt cool to the topic. But it didn't fit my son.
2.0,"They are pretty, but much bigger than expected. They are way too heavy to wear comfortably."
2.0,Was not stamped and turned my finger green..I love it its nice but can't wear it..
2.0,"This dress would have been really cute except the fabric dots just don't look good.  It fit me good, but wasn't a fan of the dots."
2.0,leather and metal fell off after 2 days of use
2.0,These sandals are a waste of money. They look nice but they are very uncomfortable. I wore them once and never used them again.Just look for something better.
2.0,Quite large for toddler’s hands. They fit me! Also note the poor English on it. “I’m going to eat up all this pizzas”  I know it’s from China but come on! Returning!
2.0,I wanted to give these a good review because I like the pants but after one wash the seam of the butt had ripped - leaving a large hole. The other colors I purchased have not done this.
2.0,"These boots were very stiff, making them too uncomfortable to wear. I returned them. The looked better in the photo than in person too."
2.0,It’s not as described when it comes to being a wristlet . It doesn’t stretch for anything in the world  unless your hands/wrists are super tiny  it’s  just for show & not actually wearable. Other than that it’s cute but  if you’re one to actually use wristlets on your wrists then don’t bother
2.0,I did like the watch but the band is not thick like my other watch. It feels to flimsi
2.0,Usually when you first buy a bra it is a bit stiff until after it has had a few washings.  This bra is still itchy after 4 months and I can't comfortably wear it for more than a few hours.  It's very pretty but that doesn't make up for the lack of comfort.  I hoping it will eventually &#34;break in&#34; but I won't buy it again.
2.0,"I bought these boots for my 3 year old.  At first I would have rated them 5 stars, because they were both cute and inexpensive.  However, it's only February and they are already unwearable.  The boots have become so worn that they no longer stay properly on her feet. I didn't expect them to be perfect at this price point, but I did expect them to make it at least most of the way through one season!"
2.0,"This product was very economical and I was shocked when we got them and they looked so nice. But alas, they broke (both sandals) within four days of receiving. The top strap is only attached by glue so came apart rather easily while my child was playing outside. We tried to re-glue them but they would stay attached."
2.0,These socks are thin and don't provide much compression. They feel like I'm wearing my wife's knee high stockings. (Don't judge me lol) plus they are slippery in shoe. I'm 6'2 270lbs I wear a size 13 shoe and I ordered to size. I wouldn't buy these again and I don't expect them to last long
2.0,"They fit right around the waist, but they just don't fit around a thick set of thighs."
2.0,"This dress feels like that cheap sheet you find in your grandparent's guest room. It came and was VERY wrinkled and when I put it on it fit strangely around the legs. The makers of this product stitched it so you have to make 4-inch steps. I thought this dress was going to be flowy but it sat pretty flat on me. For reference; I'm 5'3"" and weigh 120 pounds. I've got a slightly rectangular shape and this dress did not help my case. If anything, in this dress I look about as good as a door in a nightgown."
2.0,"Pant fit was fine, but the material is very thin and wasn't soft. It would be uncomfortable to wear as well."
2.0,So I got this item because I was going to the snow and hear that this was a must have item. I purchased it and when I received them they looked a little dirty and the strap that's on the back was already ripped. And also the zipper in the pockets were broken. I thought that for an item this expensive it would be more durable. Thank got I tried them before I left. I am 5 feet and I weigh about 120. I purchased size M and 26&#34;-30&#34; in waistline. I am curvy so maybe that's why they fight tight. I will be returning them and getting a bigger size.
2.0,The quality if these gloves was far below what I expected. I would have sent them back if we hadn't needed them the night they came in for a stage performance. They were poorly stitched with strings everywhere with low quality fabric. Will not buy again.
2.0,"Arrived with a stain on the leather, did not sit well when wearing it on the neck."
2.0,nice product but the reviews made it sound like people with much larger chests could comfortably wear this. it didn't fit me comfortably and i wear a B cup.
2.0,Honestly I did not think this product performs as advertised.  Instead of bright white lights I saw orange lights.  Not much help.
2.0,The sizing is off on this suit. . I ordered the us16-18 which is like a 4x and it is way too big. Maybe order your normal size and don't use their size chart.
2.0,"I love these sweatpants because they are so comfortable and they have pockets.  However mine quickly developed a hole in the seam on the outside of my leg.  This is not from wear and tear as I had only worn them maybe two times.  The seam just did not get sewn together very well in the area.  Anyways, I did not buy these to wear out anywhere so I still wear them around the house."
2.0,These are very cute but not very warm . They don’t look like they are going to last either . They run super small as we’ll.
2.0,These cute  little shoes popped their  straps at first try on. I contacted the seller who gave me a 20 percent refund. The shoes were super inexpensive so what did I expect?
2.0,"Not a fan. The fit itself was ok, but the pads would stick out."
2.0,Cute but not true 2 size..way 2 small
2.0,"Super cheap looking. I wore it once and realized immediately that it was not made for curvy people. I'm only 5' 3&#34; 126 Lbs, so its not like a big or anything..Poorly made. But if you buy, go a size up."
2.0,"Poor quality, it feel apart in the wash"
2.0,I will be returning this dress
2.0,"The material looks and feels cheap and was just unflattering. The colors, however, are beautiful and vibrant. I really wished it worked for me. Definitely returning."
2.0,I ordered this fascinator along with another for my wedding. Ended up wearing the other because the veil on this was so tight and short it couldn't go past my nose without getting caught and I thought it would tear if I pulled on it further. I missed the window to return it so now I'm stuck with something I can't use. I tried to use it again last week for a funeral; same problem.
2.0,I returned this dress.  It ran a little small and I was uncomfortable in it.
2.0,"Fit like a garbage bag.  For reference, I'm 5' 1"" and about 110lbs.  If you are looking for something super flowy it would be fine, but it was way too big on a small person like me."
2.0,Frustrated by setup instructions
2.0,I was Hoping these would be looser elastic ends so it doesnt dig in if you are larger than a size 6 bottoms.
2.0,Short material is extremely itchy! Even after a few washes
2.0,These were super loose. Pretty disappointed
2.0,Cheap. Cricoid on the first day
2.0,"Seriously? The tag inside the shirt says professional dry clean only.  It's a tshirt. It is too short in length, too wide in shoulders, and looks nothing like the fit pictured.  It looks like a comfy oversized shirt.  It is not.  Save your money."
2.0,"The opening for your finger is extremely small, with no give to it.  Uncomfortable to use, did not have any positive benefit.  I hoped it would stretch out a bit after using it thinking it would be more comfortable to use.  It did not, and when I tried to stretch it slightly myself to make it more comfortable it broke.  I tried a couple of them to see if they were all the same and they were."
2.0,the fit was kinda wonky
2.0,Doesn’t look like picture. The fabric is very cheap and feels like it’s from China. It’s not very flattering on and because of the fabric is so cheap it doesn’t hang nicely. Ended up returning
2.0,This is my fourth pair of slippers in a couple years. These wore down the most.
2.0,The shape of this is mega weird.  I wouldn't if I were you
2.0,The top is larger than expected.
2.0,Didn’t like how short and skin tight it was
2.0,"This mask was advertised as ""for kids,"" but it is huge. It is large on my adult face. The adjustable straps are helpful and I think I'll be able to wear it, but it was meant for my 7 year old son. He was very disappointed."
2.0,I like this product as far as fit and comfort but the waistband of one of six pair was unraveling when I took them out of the package. I trimmed the lose threads and figured I would just keep them but they are almost completely unusable after a handful of wearings and washings.  Now a second pair has started to unravel. I sent feedback to Amazon earlier today and got no response. I cannot recommend them. They are not well stitched to hold up for a reasonable amount of time.
2.0,"Other reviews were right. It's a cute dress, but a little shorter than expected. Also, the arms are very constricting.  You cannot move your arms very high in this dress!!"
2.0,Hat started tearing at the seam after one wear!
2.0,"I love the concept of this towel, I purchased it for wearing in the sauna post workout. It, fits me a little snug in the shoulder straps but that's probably because of my build. The towel is not very absorbing and the price point is too high for the quality."
2.0,Had the next larger size and it stretched out over time. If this one does not stretch out it will be to small if it stretches out it will be great. Update the new hat has not stretched out so it is to small. So Aussie Chiller people what do you suggest?
2.0,Well I’m on my second set as the first one broke before I even put it on.
2.0,Sizes are way bigger than expected
2.0,"I really wanted to love this dress because of the scallop detail. Similar dresses at name brand retailers usually run $60+. However, the dress runs extremely small. I am 5'6&#34; 160lbs, and the XL was too short. Although the dress wasn't exactly tight, the material clings to you and shows every single imperfection. Sadly, I am sending it back."
2.0,Super cute but I'm a size 12 with a 36C bust....it DID NOT FIT. I must return. I'm bummed about it :( too small.
2.0,"This seemed like a great watch, but it must go back. The “LIGHT” button illuminates the screen for two seconds, but without it the digits are dim and difficult to read. The alarm on the countdown timer is barely audible. I had to hold it up to my ear to hear it. I assume this would be the same result if I set the alarm. This watch does not function as necessary."
2.0,A lot bigger and sticks out
2.0,Get the Casio Men's F105W-1A Illuminator Sport Watch instead.
2.0,These do not fit like my other size medium underwear - I prefer them a little loose.  I also don't care for the fabric.  I would return them if I could (only wore one pair but doubt they'd let me return the rest ha ha)
2.0,I loved the way it looked but it was SO SCRATCHY! It actually gave me similar to a rug burn on my neck just from the duration of trying it on! If you can figure out a way to make the fabric not scratch the bajeezus out of you then go for it.
2.0,they are cute but not exactly what i was expecting. a bit too big for me. bout the size of a golf ball.
2.0,"Ordered an XL & they sent me a Large expected football jersey size so big and baggy. Its extremely tight, sized just like a regular t shirt not a football jersey. Usually wear a 2X t shirt & a large jersey, but i wanted it big for night shirt so ordered XL. They dont offer a 2XL so IDK what to do with it. The shirt itself is nice so if you order get t shirt size. I might have been able to wear an XL had they sent me the size I ordered.<br /><br />Only reason I gave 2 stars is that it's a nice shirt, but be forewarned they might just send you whatever size they have laying around"
2.0,The letter print is not a red color it is more of a burgundy not vibrant colors at all very dull.
2.0,The dress is longer then it looks in the picture and material is not what I expected.
2.0,"After cleaning it look same, material is equivalent to the price, but one button came out after 1st wash"
2.0,Nice but they send me the wrong color
2.0,Beautiful from the front but cheap looking and hollow from behind
2.0,"Bought this dress for our family vacation to the beach for our family beach photos! I was super excited. It matches my daughter's dress perfect. It smelled a little so I looked for washing instructions and there was none! So I washed it gentle cycle, alone took it out now the fabric looks funny. I'm heart broken. I spent no ey on a dress, vacation is soon and now I'm in a rush to find a new dress! Super dissapointed."
2.0,"I like the look of these, but they were too big for my face."
2.0,These are pretty but don’t fasten like the ones I’ve bought before. The fasteners constantly comes undone.
2.0,"You can’t button or unbutton the shirt,  something is wrong with the holes! We have to return it!"
2.0,too small for my needs
2.0,"The suit is ok. It is NOT crocheted! It is cut out. Crochet is what I wanted, so I was disappointed. It came with a customs sticker from China and no included paperwork, so I did not return it, but I would have otherwise."
2.0,Super soft and comfy but runs really small
2.0,Feel and fit great but unfortunately still visible on the heel part of the shoes I bought them for.
2.0,The neck line and button runs smaller than expected yet there is plenty of room in the arms and rest of the shirt.
2.0,These shirts are advertised as XXL size but the fit is absurdly SMALL and TIGHT. No way these are 2x for the North American market place. I guess Asians have a skinnier standard! Nice shirt and looks well made but just WAY too small for the size advertised. Shame. This shirt was ridiculously tight.
2.0,I purchased a size 3 for my daughter who where's a size 2 in hopes we could get extra use of them. The shoes run about 2 sizes too big.
2.0,"The ones I got were open and smelled like bad breath and mold. A few of the rings were actually gunked with black goo. They took the return, no problems (hence two stars), but yuck!"
2.0,Runs a bit small around but material is wonderful
2.0,"Unfortunately,  this blouse is my biggest shopping disappointment this year.  It looks so beautiful in the picture, but in reality, only its long sheer sleeves are keeping their promise.  These sleeves are pieces of art and should be attached to a different blouse!!!  The actual blouse which comes with those gorgeous sheer sleeves is made of very cheap looking fabric and has a neckline that is way too low.  It is so low that I can't wear this blouse to work or anywhere.<br /><br />If I had the skill, I would remove the sleeves and put them on a better blouse, but as it is, I cannot recommend this blouse."
2.0,"It fit well around me but it offered no coverage. Spillage on the sides and top. Disappointed, if there was more material I’d have loved these."
2.0,I'm about 6'1&#34; and 200lbs. I wouldn't call myself fat but skinny I am not. I usually wear a size large shirt and so I ordered a large. The length is about right but this shirt is clearly intended for an obese person. It will not fit you like the model in the picture. To take that picture the photographer pinned back the excess fabric. I wouldn't order this shirt in any size unless you're at least a good 50 lbs over weight.
2.0,"The 2nd. morning I work up and the umbrella was turned around 180 degrees,  We straighted it up and though it was work.  I bought it to help give me some shade until my new tree grows up.  Due to the drought and extreem heat I lost one of my trees and, of course, it was the one that gave me shade for my patio and covered deck.  I decided to send the umprella back when I found out that the shipping  would cost me close to $90.00.  I bought the umbrella on sale and didn't have to pay a great deal for it so, $90.00  did not seem cost effective to send it back."
2.0,I have always had to purchase children's masks as my face is small.  These gapped open very much on the sides as they were smaller than others I have tried.  They do not cover mouth area enough.
2.0,cheap material- but it'll do
2.0,The shirt is crinkly where the image is and it fits weirdly lol
2.0,Long strap broke in a couple weeks.
2.0,Read the reviews and ordered a large but still too small.
2.0,The print is hazy and the material is awful. Definitely wouldn’t wast the money. Says it’s 98% cotton 8% poly. It’s more like 98% poly!
2.0,Fits freakishly small
2.0,"One size does not fit all, bought them for someone who was tiny and they were still too small"
2.0,"The fabric was VERY thin....i normally wear a med to large top ( im 5’9, 160 lbs)...i ordered the large in 2 colors...very small.  I think the style could be flattering  if it was the right size, but so cheaply made,  and not butt covering with leggings which is what I wanted. I doubt they would hold up to much wear or washing….I returned both colors."
2.0,The robe and hat were cute but they sent me a 2020 tassel instead of 2021.
2.0,"i thought i was getting more than one for what i paid, which is cool. however, the adjusting strap broke immediately."
2.0,The size ran extra small.
2.0,Really pretty colors but very cheap looking.
2.0,Value is low for the money asked.
2.0,Liked watch but diden&#34;t like band at all-it broke in no time.
2.0,"It’s an okay dress, material is not the best"
2.0,I have the full length leggings and they are amazing but the Capri leggings are cut much smaller.  They don't fit at all.
2.0,Just a long wife beater. Stretched horribly after about 30 minutes of sitting in it. Neckline too high and really cheap looking. Wearing it as a nightgown because I'm too lazy to return it.
2.0,"Not what I was expecting, would rather  wait on sales at Zara and H&M since pricing would be similar but quality will be heads and shoulders above this jacket.  Poor material and zipper is flimsy, looks way better in the picture."
2.0,Clip broke within 2 weeks of careful use. I was never rough with these. Used them only about 6 times before the clip fell apart.
2.0,"These are really cute, but they fit funny. The top is cropped (but not in s cute way) and the shorts we're too high."
2.0,"From the image I knew it was a higher slit, but the slit of this dress is so high it shows everything. I have a small chest and small waist with a larger butt and it fit perfectly on top but I was completely exposed on the bottom portion. The material is super thin borderline sheer where it is only single lined. With a little more fabric on the skirt portion I think this could be a great dress."
2.0,It's beautiful but came broken. Not worth the hassle to return. Just gonna accept the loss.
2.0,Worked. The glass shop won’t work on it they didn’t believe it’s titanium had to do it my self I guess for the price it’s ok
2.0,Cute patterns but not so good craftsmanship. There were a lot of loose threads. For the price though it’ll do. Makes for a nice covering over a filter mask. You get what you pay for.
2.0,"It fit at first, but even following the instructions, it shrank in the arms & overall length enough that I don't feel comfortable wearing it. It's too bad because it was cute."
2.0,"I bought a pair of similar pants some years ago and really liked the look and feel. So I bought more and with each purchase, the quality became worse. I had to send these back. *sigh*"
2.0,"The dress is what we expected for the quality & material but the length was the midi length. The description said long, ankle length! The mid leg length made the look less elegant for what we needed it for!"
2.0,"I wanted to love this dress, but it was way too much material and bulky and makes you look larger"
2.0,"The leather is cheap, stiff, and has a distinctly non-leather but very chemical scent to it that I can't seem to shake. Also the lining of the bag looks cheaply glue on for those few areas where there is a lining. The bag was promptly sent back to Amazon."
2.0,"I bought two of these in size small in 2020. I’ve decided to be more conscious of the purchases I make and I’m looking for more organic options. Unlike many of the other reviewers, I didn’t have any issues with fit. I really liked these when I first got them. They were a little thin, but I was mainly going to wear them while exercising or in the summer heat, so that was ok. My issue is that, after just a couple of summers of use, they are getting stretched out and threadbare in some places. Part of living more sustainably is also getting more use out of the items we purchase. I don’t feel like these lasted long enough to be worth buying."
2.0,Had to return didn't work.  But looked good.  Return process was good.
2.0,"I bought a size 9, and couldnt even get my foot inside...so i gave them to my 12 year old. After 4 months the sole on one if the boots has ripped from the side. Too bad....they are cute to look at."
2.0,The sewing job is 😐
2.0,Says 0-3 months. More like 6-9
2.0,"This belt was a bit of a disappointment.<br />I am leaving the world of wearing leather accessories and had high hopes for this belt.<br /><br />It is a very flimsy / soft elastic so even if you overtighten it there is little support.<br />The ""buckle"" is a thin, lightweight plastic contraption that is a set it forget it, but I don't see it holding up for how thin it is.<br /><br />I always felt my pants were sagging when I would bend at the waist.<br />It would not support any belt mounted accessories.<br /><br />It may work for some for a travel belt, but for daily wear, work wear it falls short."
2.0,"It’s cheap material and fits pretty small, so buy a bigger size."
2.0,The item was very uncomfortable and I did not even receive the correct color. The cut also did not resemble the photographs.
2.0,nice but to small just can see it no time to send back  if looking for size not this
2.0,The mask is way too big and does not fit properly.
2.0,I was so excited for this cute sweater. I am a size 16 and it was way to small. The arms end before my wrists and the length was way to small. If you are plus sized the XL most likely will not fit. It is warm though and very soft.
2.0,"I do not like this garment as much as I thought I would. The fabric is nice and thick, but it doesn’t fit me as well as I thought it would. Still, it’s an overall nice dress, but I wouldn’t buy it if I’d had the chance to try it on first."
2.0,Coating is peeling off the temples of the glasses. One side is white plastic showing where the coating has peeled off. The other side with the peeling is showing a clear plastic. I am unable to wear the glasses any more due to the peeling of two different colors of coating.
2.0,"The quality shown on other reviews, is not indicative of what I received.  Not a BAD strap, just nowhere near what other people are showing. Maybe I got a bunk one."
2.0,"It’s hard to tell in the picture, but the tabs on the end of the drawstring are gunmetal gray while the buttons at the top of the front pockets (which serve no purpose other than looks) are a brass color.  If those buttons are only there for looks, why do they clash with the tabs on the drawstrings?  The little fake leather patch that’s on the front pocket is just a hodgepodge of clothing terms.  It looks like it would advertise a brand, but it’s just a confusing mess.  It reads “Fashion style news leisure fashion series classic&collection”."
2.0,"The colors are great. I have worn 2 pairs so far. After one wearing, the first pair had a hole in the toe. The other pair had a hole in the heel after 1 hour."
2.0,No matter what you do they will slide off
2.0,"This open front poncho cape with hood (I ordered it in Blue) is nothing like the pictures depicted it. I am 5'10 and wear a size 24/26 (US) it fits like a size misses size Med/Lg. I realize it's a OSFA and given the majority of reviews I thought it would work out quite nicely. Honestly it looks more like a large scarf, the hood is to small to fit over my head. The fabric is very soft, but thin. This is going back for a credit back to my charge card tomorrow."
2.0,"I LOVE these, and ordered 2. Gave a 2 star rating because the hardware on my first order completely broke off within 2 months! Fabric and stitching is perfect, but now must purchase new hooks for the first order, which is now unwearable,  and back ups for my second order, as they are of the same flimsy hardware. Otherwise, would have EASILY given these a 5 star rating!"
2.0,The size on the paper fooled me. It's too small so I gave mine a way
2.0,"These ""shorts"" are long.  They are much longer than expected.  The inseam is 7&1/2 inches and from the top to the inseam is 14 inches, for a total of 21&1/2 inches.  If you like shorts that hang well below the knee, then these are for you.  Not for me."
2.0,Looks cheap for price
2.0,Needs smaller sizes
2.0,"The quality of the material is great but the size run pretty small. I wear a small and purchased a medium and it still too small, I would recommend to get 2 sizes up than what you actually wear."
2.0,I really wanted to live this dress. I tried it on and it looked frumpy and the material feels like cray paper - I’m going to return it.<br />ordered a size Med
2.0,"Yes they are adorable but very poor quality.  Only after few months of light use, they are already ripped.  Another pair my daughter wore, slightly older pair, were ripped in multiple places.  Very disappointed.  Will not buy again."
2.0,Pretty but not sturdy. The stones have already chipped and the metal is soft. Inexpensive and performs as such.
2.0,"Shorts okay, but sizing must be for youth sizes...not even close to a men's large"
2.0,"Nice looking case. However, would not charge while in the case."
2.0,Thin and cheap. Need more ironing in my regular doctors.
2.0,"The overall structure of the ring is great! It is dainty and very feminine. However, after only about a week of wearing it, some of the gold on the zodiac sign has began to rub off. I take it off when washing my hands but I wasn’t expecting it to rub off after only a week."
2.0,I've owned necklaces like this in the past and was very excited to receive this one. It was very cheaply made. I returned immediately.
2.0,I loved the looks and price of these ratings BUT the post are sooooo long that when I lay down they stab me in the back of the ear ... wish the post were shorter then I would like them more
2.0,"said 2XL,  was way too small"
2.0,The socks are missing half the lettering
2.0,I ordered a XXL after I  hand washed it and air dried it the tag inside was a SIZE 12 which IS NOT XXL!!!  So if you are a SIZE 12 THE XXL WILL NOT FIT. I am wearing it and it feels like a compression bra which is great if you are stopping nursing.
2.0,"Well, it looked very cute on me for 2 days. And then, stitches started to come apart from the top.  So, I was very disappointed, especially since I liked the design and how warm it was. I ended up returning it to Amazon."
2.0,"These shorts do not actually have a rolled cuff!  They are just straight-leg white jean shorts.  Also, the denim is thin enough that the pockets show through.  Returning these as they weren't what I wanted."
2.0,"Made very well,attractive soft comfortable,just runs a bit small."
2.0,im returning this for credit because is too big
2.0,They are pretty flimsy. Not much control...
2.0,One of the straps came off while I was trying it on. I was barely pulling it over my shoulder when the stitching came undone. Not impressed.
2.0,The sizing on this is WAY off. Ordered a 36D and it looks like it is about a 34 B. Insanely small.
2.0,It won't hold the tie in the back so it only sits loose
2.0,"I have been trying to find tops with dolman sleeves and shirred waists to replace the ones I bought years ago through Coldwater Creek and have worn constantly for work. These had the silhouette, but are not well made. The sleeves are too tight and the material is ridiculously thin - I would have to wear a camisole under it in order to be work appropriate. Returned."
2.0,honestly I did not like the fit of this dress it was to big in all the wrong places and makes you look larger then your actual size. The dress was also thicker then it looks so it is warm and to heavy to wear and the sleeves are full lengths. The gathering at the waist is far to cinched making it look awkward. I am not a large person 5'4 130lb with pretty much no curves so i gave it to my friend who is a bit curvier and it looked even worse honesty theres no win with this particular dress style such a awkward cut and shape very disappointed.
2.0,We ordered these jackets in bulk for our dance team and the zipper is stuck at the top on more than half of them. Wondering if there’s anything we can do?
2.0,These were supposed to have a vibrant reflective lens.  They are very see through and cheaply made.  Would not buy again.
2.0,Hate these!  Run large and no tummy control at all.
2.0,"The pendant part of this is 5 star, however I only gave it a 2 star rating due to the extreme cheapness of the chain. I would be ashamed to give it as a gift to my teenage grandson with the original chain, so had to spend $25 extra on a nicer chain for it."
2.0,"Very nice construction and style.  I should have paid closer attention, the inside does not have any pockets nor organizers."
2.0,The fact that it says white when I looked at it when I received the item the color isn't white but cream or bone white something like that ..<br />And it's not sown properly the moment I tried it the thread start ripping..Not what I expected..Poor quality
2.0,"The fabric is soft and t-shirt like but the seams are poorly sewn, the wrap doesn’t stay secure and it’s all together just falling apart. Threads are lose everywhere. You can tell I bought this on amazon"
2.0,Too long. I'd have to sew a new hem line or wear high heels. But I liked the fabric and flow of the skirt
2.0,"I liked the style, but the XL fit more like a small. I could not zip it (too much gap in zip to close it). I will reorder, but in a larger size."
2.0,Color was not what was pictured
2.0,The arch support did not locate on my arch properly; had to return.
2.0,"Comfortable for walking but after one use, I went back to my jeans as there was no back pocket for my phone or wallet."
2.0,I was very excited after reading the reviews for this jacket. I ordered a size down and it’s still a pinch too big but I’m not sure if I went another size down if it would be too small.<br /><br />It’s comfy and the material is nice but the color is definitely not accurate. I ordered the army green and the jacket received is brown. No resemblance to the color shown in the pictures. Not even close to green!
2.0,bad quality.. looks super cheap..
2.0,the material had strings all over and the armpit got  a hole in it after one use.
2.0,"I am 178 cm Height; 70 Kgs, choose SML size; too tight and uncomfortable to wear or put it on.  I wish I better choose a MED size."
2.0,"Cute dress.<br />Runs small.<br />Absolutely no stretch.<br />Thin, cheap material.<br />There's no way I'd fit into this dress.<br />36DDD and I didnt even try putting it on.<br />Sticking my arms into the dress I knew it wouldn't go in.<br />Returning."
2.0,"I really like the design. The problem is I think that it runs a bit small. ALso, the bottoms are SEE THROUGHOUT. I wouldn't wear this to the beach. I&#34;m going to make use of it by using in the sauna at my gym. SO, all in all I wouldn't recommend this for the beach/pool. ( what most people use bathing suits for."
2.0,"runs very small, extra large is like a medium."
2.0,The hasp the hold the pendent on broke second time I wore it
2.0,Beautiful dress but sizes are completely off. I wear a 18 in everything.  I ordered an 18 20 and couldn't even get this on!
2.0,Wrinkles VERY easy. Feels cheap
2.0,this hat is too small.  It does not fit well on my head.
2.0,"5 Stars for Amazon return policy, 1 Star at best for this product.<br />I carefully measured product before ordering. It has [some] compression but basically no posture support. It digs into the armpits and doesn't help or improve posture.<br /><br />I let the return period expire so that's on me. Again, high praise for Amazon's easy, no-hassle return policy. Garment itself has about $3.00 worth of product so about $92.00 of pure profit from each one sold. Better to get a posture support product from one of the other items Amazon carry's on it's website."
2.0,Tight waist bands
2.0,Very pretty but broke after about a month
2.0,I can't use one with knobs which I didn't notice--not watches fault.  My husband will use it.
2.0,Super cute...but the rhinestones started falling off just one week after having them.
2.0,Really cheap quality material. Also fits huge on little ones.
2.0,[[VIDEOID:91774fbad78afc64d7c08c6a434bcf40]] The frame was to big for my Fitbit kept popping off the buttons wouldn’t work because it was too loose and it was too tight on the wrist
2.0,the bracelet itself was nice but I wore it for more than a day and the clasp turned my wrist green. So it's a wear once in awhile bracelet.
2.0,Cling material. Did not like at all
2.0,Seems like the arm holes are large.
2.0,"There are imperfections in the stamping that show glaringly in the star of the shield. It is small for an adult male. The red and blue paint is ok, but the silver is sad. I guess for the price its fine but the picture they present is not represented on what you get."
2.0,"Cute shoe, but runs way big and I don’t think will be too comfortable.  For $6 more I shoulda stuck with the Nike."
2.0,"Okay cap quality, but universal size was a bit big for me and my head is average size.  If you have a large head or if you like it loose fitting than this will be okay, but for me it's too loose for my liking.  The ears does get snug fit to keep warm becuase the buckle for the ears does not adjust tightly enough.  No recommended and can not return without paying return shipping.  Waste of money!"
2.0,"These fit extra long and very baggy in the legs while quite snug at my waist.  The cloth is very thin, good for summer in that way.  The problem is these pants wrinkle like crazy and so I find myself limited to wearing these at times when I don't go out in public."
2.0,This product being $8 and all was not as good as I imagined it would be. The beads and the string we’re small and sticky/waxy. It felt like it would break at any second if it was tugged on too hard.
2.0,"poorly put together in a hurry, stones crooked and realy to fall of base. returned and got refund back. thank you."
2.0,"i love this shirt but it runs really small.  I usually wear an xl and this was skin tight in belly.  I love the length, fabric and pockets.  such a bummer it runs like a tight fitting tee and nothing like a loose tunic ."
2.0,"I really wanted to like these flip flops, I even bought two of them to wear around the house after work, to help with stimulation.  The problem is, the sole of the sandal is too heavy for the straps and they caused the straps to tear and break in the center.  Disappoint!"
2.0,"I would not call these &#34;girls&#34; gloves. I ordered them for two 5 year old girls and when they came they fit me. I have not been a girl for several years. As for the product, it is a nice glove but not for a younger girl. They would fit an older girl late teens or a larger child."
2.0,They are way to small not in American sizes or something couldn't even get them over my hips disappointed
2.0,"Cute pattern. That is the only reason I am giving this sleep two stars instead of one. At the time of me purchasing this which was during the past winter, my son was 3 year old, 50% percentile in height, and size medium (3-5 years) was way too small for him. Had to return and ordered the size large, still barely large enough. Anyway I decided to keep them ( I ordered 3 with different patterns) since my son love the cars on them. I am 100% sure it will be too small to wear for the next winter, when my son will turn 4. But come on people, the size large are supposed to fit 5-7 years old!!! Also, the quality is poor, the fleece is loose woven and sheds a lot during washing. And there are loose threads along the zipper. I also have wearable blankets from HALO and you can obviously see the quality difference. Will never buy anything from this brand again!"
2.0,They look and feel like Halloween costume boots and not something that you can really wear. WIl be returning them.
2.0,"There's a reason why these crash pants are ""hand wash only"" - because they're made cheaply. The material just doesn't stand up to any sort of trauma. It tore itself rubbing against my pants, and that's just through one outing. Also, the rip revealed the actual pad, which appears to be made from the same materials as the swimming kickboards. On top of that, when new, the crash pants SMELL. They smelled like chemicals emitting from the pads. It was honestly impossible to put in my closet without washing them thoroughly to try to get rid of the chemical smell.<br /><br />I bought these because they were made in the USA, but these junk are so bad, they made the made-in-China junk look good. At least the other ones are machine washable, doesn't give you cancer, and is less than half of what these pads demand. Threw mine away, huge disappointment."
2.0,TOO HEAVY for my ears!!!
2.0,Pants tore open mostly along seam when I moved my leg while moving around on the couch. They were not tight and they also tore in one spot that wasn't along the seam. For the amount paid for these they shouldn't have torn so easily. They did look good and felt comfortable for the few minutes I was wearing them.
2.0,This product is not as advertised. They post a very clean new looking cap. The cap actually has a distressed look of which I don’t care for
2.0,It is too tight for my head and I realized it does not look good on me. It looked good on my 5-year-old granddaughter!
2.0,"The first thing my 4 year old great grandson noticed was that the eyebrows were not red.Small mistake, true, but not to a Angry Bird loving 4 year old."
2.0,"These are smaller than you'd expect. But they do fit snug and you wont have the droopy nose problem. The quality seems pretty good. The flag is just a steam press plastic patch. Not stitched. Overall, I think they are over priced as I am sure it didn't cost very much to make these things."
2.0,Cheap made. Broke withing hours of my son wearing.. weak string.
2.0,The color was off and she’s very cheaply made
2.0,Not as much resistant as I thought
2.0,To long returning it but it was cute
2.0,"After wearing my grey socks today for only four hours my feet did not feel right, I then took my shoes off only to realized there is a hole in  both sides of the socks at the big toe."
2.0,"I have a dress similar to this that I LOVE, but it has a cowl neck and is too much fabric on a hot day. I bought this as after searching high & low for a dress with cotton. Description is false, tag states polyester + spandex. So bummed!<br /><br />A drawstring dress has one function… the ability to draw the string to adjust its length. This drawstring is sewn into the seam of the dress. I worry that if I take a seam ripper to it, it will make the rest of the seam come undone. Also the strings go down to my ankles, so unless I trim them I’ll be tripping over them.<br /><br />If it weren’t for the false advertising and lack of functionality, I would give it more stars. The fit is perfect and it has the right amount of stretch. It’s the color I want, it fits well, & it was cheap. Not sure if I’ll return it or attempt to free the strings"
2.0,"I got this watch because I wanted a classy-looking one for a low price. It looks absolutely amazing, but after about 2 months of wearing it, it has become very rough. The ""leather"" parts are completely falling apart, the two miniature straps keeping the big strap down have completely fallen off. It looks very worn out and bit are falling off it. It's cheaply made. Looks good, but you are definitely getting what you pay for."
2.0,Not the mostly flattering shorts
2.0,"When my son first got these shoes (that he saved up for with money he earned) he was SO excited. Where we live it rains A LOT so he doesn't get to wear them hardly ever. we have had them for a few months now and he has worn them a hand full of times. I have followed the charging instructions to a T, and i have always been the one to attach and detach the usb. all of a sudden, one shoe wont charge, and the other has random lights that flicker and or change to a different color ( if they both worked this wouldn't be a big deal) Anyways, i know they aren't expensive shoes but i was hoping they would have lasted longer than they did. Im just sad for the little boy who LOVED these shoes."
2.0,"Received the bag today, and it was definitely smaller than what I had hoped. I feels cheap and it definitely smells like fish on the inside. Returning and going to go with a different bag. I don't hate it, but it's just not for me."
2.0,"This shirt is extremely see through.  This means you have to wear a thank top under it, which is somewhat annoying.  If you don't care, it's a cute style though!"
2.0,No hardware! Seems to be a common theme from other reviews. Kinda hard to assemble without it.
2.0,Black dye?? I was cleaning these before putting them in and they started bleeding black dye. Very disappointed. I hope it's at least made from something organic and isn't toxic.
2.0,Wore the hat twice and the Pom Pom came off the top. Really disappointed as the hat itself is nice.
2.0,"These are not very pretty, and look cheap in person"
2.0,"These are lovely stones, if you can see them. OK, so  I figured that 1.14 ct would be small but these are really really really small. I have a very small head so I ought to get by wearing them, but they are so small I do feel a bit self conscious. Would I buy them again, no."
2.0,"Disappointed. I am busty and it pulls across my bust. I would have returned it if I didn't have to pay for shipping back to China. Too bad, the dress has potential to be adorable. I guess I'll have to remake it myself.<br />Duo mad I have to pay return shipping. Don't buy this!!!!!"
2.0,"The seams are already coming apart after only having it about a month. Also, the leather leaves marks on your cards, and tends to stick to them. It can be tough to get them out of the pockets. Bigger than I expected, although that is my fault. Quality leather, but I think I'm going back to my old wallet."
2.0,The sleeves are TIGHT !  The rest of the dress is nice.  Had to give it away to someone with TINY arms
2.0,"Too small. I thought this was a bigger watch and it looked like a women's watch or a kids watch. I'm a big boy, and I needed a big boy watch. I gave this watch to my 8 year old nephew."
2.0,Jewel fell off after I wore it two times...
2.0,These socks just keep getting thinner and thinner.  I expect these to wear out quickly. They are soft and feel good (when new) but when I pull them tight I can see right through the fabric.  They did come in a Fruit OTL package but I will not be buying these again.  This product's ratings are so obviously padded with tons of one-sentence 5-star reviews.  The reliability of Amazon has gone down so much since they have allowed this gaming of their review system.  Don't be a fool.
2.0,Nothing the lights went out and there is a decided shoes I another replacement for the second time. This was gift for my grandson. I need the same color as be for. BLUE!
2.0,Not horrid but a bit clingy and see-through. Need to wear a tank under it or bra is very obvious.
2.0,"Very cheap and flimsy, you get what you pay for. The detail lines are very faint, I don't expect this ring to last the summer but it is true to size."
2.0,"It's OK. Only thing I didn't like is the color.  The ""Black"" looks more like a dark grey."
2.0,"That would be me, lol. Cut off circulation...had to return. Well made though."
2.0,"This jacket fits at the bottom and the shoulders, but forget it if you happen to be blessed with extra tummy. I usually wear an XL or XXL top depending on the maker. But my waist is more like an 18 to 22 depending. If only the jacket profile was straight top to bottom."
2.0,It was nice for a while but the inside broke and eventually broke off the Fitbit.
2.0,The fabric was cheap and I the the material would be a little better. I'll prolly get one good wear out of them.
2.0,"I bought this for Christmas, to have my husband wear for my grandson. The pants are very short. The mask has 2 small holes for breathing and 2 small holes in the eyes. I did not feel comfortable to have anyone wear this because of this. I ended up putting it on a  mannequin that we have at work,  for Christmas decorations there.<br />Really disappointed we could not wear it.<br />The green fur comes off easily. Glad I had a discount code and did not pay full price."
2.0,The bag I bought seems like it was already used; it had gross grease(?) smudges on it.<br />Even if it wasn’t nasty I would have returned it since it felt really flimsy and the bottle pocket is way too small.
2.0,I would only blame the designer.<br />As soon as I would fill it with 3 credit cards and a passport. It would look as a fat big wallet. And it would break my passport.<br />Not recommended
2.0,"Not a fan of this bodysuit. There are no snaps at the bottom, so you have to take the while thing off if you need to go to the bathroom, or do one of those awkard side-pull maneuvers.  The material is thick and good quality, but there is a partial lining in the torso that stops at a weird spot on the bust, giving a bunchy, wrinkled look underneath. The shoulder area also has the lining which made it look and feel bulky like shoulderpads. Also the back is not 100% thong, and not quite a full panty so you get crazy panty lines unless you want to give yourself a wedgie and wear it more like a thong. Just awkward overall and returning."
2.0,They are nice socks but I got three of the same kind there were supposed to be two different pairs.
2.0,"The shorts were oversized, yet they pulled at my legs.  I tried to give it a go though, but the gathered elastic section was extremely itchy.  I just could not wear them for very long, especially if I was sitting!  Material is light weight and what I was looking for, but just not a comfortable pair of shorts."
2.0,Very feminine. Not for men.
2.0,They are more for layering. They are thin and the bottom irritatingly roll up when I sit down.
2.0,"Unfortunately, there's a quality issue with this robe. The fabric is not too warm so it's great to wear around the house. However I noticed a hole in the pocket immediately after washing it on cold before wearing it. And last night, the zipper started to come apart from the bottom up. I am pretty sure it's mad in China. So I will still wear it in the house but I don't expect it to last for long due to the poor quality."
2.0,Sizing is off this Large was for a child.
2.0,"It is a beautiful set. But the ring was too small for my finger. It looks great in the picture, but not in reality. It's also hard to put on. It is cute and I'll work with it."
2.0,Ordered the X/XL size and these are way too tight. Had to take them off 1/4 of the way through an overnight shift.
2.0,Not as impressed with the flexibles as the infinity scrubs. Big difference!
2.0,The material was cheap and too tight.  Didn't like how it fit especially the top.  Returned. If you are very thin it will be fine.  I felt like it's not for any medium sized people.
2.0,"The fabric is nice, and looks like the picture, but, it was wayyyy too short on me, and I'm only 5'3&#34;...this would be like a t-shirt on someone taller."
2.0,I wanted to love this shirt as it looks great in the pictures however the fabric seemed thin as very cheap plus the sleeves were cut in an unusual way. Disappointed and returning.
2.0,"I bought these for my boyfriend before he went to the 49ers @ Raiders game and he liked the idea, but when we put them on his face, they are actually cheap, stiff stickers. He used all six throughout the game to replace them from falling off.<br /><br />I got some Eagles ones when we went to the Eagles @ Dallas game this season and mine were great even in my &#34;I'm going to get too drunk to look normal for pictures&#34; makeup. Get temporary tattoos rather than the strips."
2.0,"The glasses have magnification, so it's hard to see and focus in objects."
2.0,"In theory, these shoes are amazing. I loved that they came charged so my son could wear them right out of the package. The colors are bright, and my son's face lit up the moment he opened the box. However, other than a great idea and awesome customer service from the company, the shoes have been a huge disappointment. For starters, one of the shoes will not hold a charge. We've even tried multiple chargers. The button to change the color of the lights is in a bad location which rubs a sore spot on the top of my son's foot unless the velcro is loose. The top of the shoe, above his toes, is already cracking from use, and he hasn't been wearing them even 3 weeks. Finally, the rubber around the lights is already coming unglued from the rest of the shoe.<br /><br />As mentioned, the customer service representative was awesome, which is why I gave the shoes 2 stars. Overall, however, this was a very disappointing purchase."
2.0,"And none of the pictures does it show that there are these tiny little plastic rings that actually hold the straps , they are just tiny cheap plastic rings that would never survive real use or a washer /dryer"
2.0,I purchased them because they were suppose to fit over glasses. However they push the frame of my glasses against my face to the point of being very uncomfortable. It's not the fault of my glasses because my son has a pair that fit over my glasses very comfortably.  I gave them away and will be purchasing the same brand my son has.
2.0,These sunglasses are kind of Havey and they came in crooked
2.0,"Product is great, however, the length of the side arms (if that's how you call it) are too short. It does not cover your ears like it supposed to."
2.0,"As you can see in the picture, the bottom portion of the bra is super awkward. My top was pretty thick and the bottom stuck out and it was just uncomfortable and weird."
2.0,"There's not enough material in the back to tuck into the elastic band. Most do-rags have a tuckable tail. The tail in the picture is the part that needs to be tied not an actual tail tuck. It just flops around on top of your head. C'mon Indian you can do better, especially for the price paid."
2.0,the ring turned after the first wear
2.0,[[VIDEOID:568f75e527e4396248974c9b8e9bac73]] The jewel side of the heart is so flat and completely uneven compared to the right side. The picture shown when buying looks perfect. That's why I bought it. I haven't even tried it on yet because this made me sad.
2.0,"I had high hopes for these socks as they were well priced and reviews said they did not itch.  True.  Unfortunately they are not well made.  The weave is loose and the material thin.  I feel like they will wear out quickly.  They stretch very easily and  tend to sag around my ankles.  Also, the cable pattern is on the soles of the socks.  I don't know about most people, but I can feel the pattern and find it annoying.  It is very hard to find wool socks to wear with street shoes and not made for heavy snow boots.  I guess I will continue the search.  Sigh."
2.0,Cute but runs too small. Supplier was quick to give a refund. :D
2.0,IT IS NOT THE RIGHT COLOR I HAD ORDER IT IS BLACK
2.0,I redid the whole neckline.  The dress was too tight in the bustline too.
2.0,"This coat is very, very cute and feels thick and warm, but the zipper broke the first time my child wore it. She isn't the kind of kid who's particularly wild, either. She was just walking outside and the zipper pulled apart. I've been able to install a new zipper, but the kind of negates the money I saved buying this over a more expensive option. You get what you pay for, I suppose. The kitty hood is very sweet and got a lot of compliments."
2.0,Pretty but fimsy
2.0,For numerous reasons I can't recommend this brand.
2.0,The sweatsuit is not the best quality but it's OK
2.0,To short.  I an 5'9 person and this item is short length mid waist. The sweater is made well but It needs to be longer for tall people.
2.0,"Not a huge fan but I gave them to my smaller chested girlfriend and she loved them! I am a bit larger in the chest than the waist and the armpits dug in to me, not a stretchy fabric at all so there was a big gap over my stomach (not fitted.) Definitely for smaller women."
2.0,"They’re beautiful but definitely not true to size. The flares are much too large to get them in, even if I use steam and moisturizer. I had to verify that I purchased the 1/2 inch size because that’s what I wear in every other pair I own. I’m bummed because they’re gorgeous but I won’t ever be able to wear them."
2.0,I think this product is very pretty but I'm upset that I cannot fit it.. Does this product run small? If so I need a bigger size.. Please help
2.0,"I winded up not using it for an event because it didn’t fit the way I expected.  I’m very curvy and in between sizes due to weight loss. I ordered a larger size hoping alterations would be minimal,  but no such luck.  The fabric was also definitely not what I was looking for.  It seemed more glossy and transparent than the alternate dress that I selected to wear from the seller.  Thankfully, I purchase two dresses, in case.  I love the design of this dress, but overall it didn’t love me."
2.0,The shirt was to small. I had to go up like two size.
2.0,Pretty color on one side only so you have to spend time arranging it or you see the unprinted white side of the fabric.  Disappointed.
2.0,I don’t know why I try with these types of clothes. Felt like a doll. It was very restricting
2.0,"Really tight, and the sleeves are really really long! Nice quality and seems to be good value for the price. Slightly smaller than expected."
2.0,"The dress looks like the picture, the material isn't the best looking up close but farther away it isn't too bad, but it runs incredible too big."
2.0,"The shirt was a very unattractive shape. It doesn't fit curves at all, and I found it did not look good tucked in.  However, the quality of the fabric and the sewing etc. were high quality. T"
2.0,It is really hard getting my sons foot in. The opening needs more stretch. I would suggest anyone buy the next size up.
2.0,"Pants came with a giant hole in the pocket, and after 2 washes the eyelets have come out. You get what you pay for, I guess."
2.0,Cute shirt just didn’t good around arms and shoulders
2.0,"I am 5'2"" 100lbs I bought a size small and the outfit is too big."
2.0,Most pieces are poorly made and extremely fragile.
2.0,"Thinner than expected, a little snug in a not flattering way. And I didn't notice the breast pocket in the image, which sits in a weird way for a women's dress.."
2.0,The armholes were weirdly small.  Had to return it.
2.0,"I wanted to get my husband some silicone rings to wear for work, and went with these because they’re a good price and he loves the color red. After only a couple of weeks of wearing one of the rings, it started to stretch out and it falls off of his finger. He switched to another ring in the pack, and it did the same after about a week. He just pulled out a brand new ring in the pack, and it fits perfectly for now."
2.0,These were too small; gave them to my daughter but she hasn't let me know if they fit or not.
2.0,"got xl, arrived pretty much as a small. cute design but i would return if it wasnt such a hassle"
2.0,No tiene las ranuras para tarjetas que dice.
2.0,"We've had the problem mentioned in another comment that the buckle comes off strap easily. Unfortunately, the solution offered by seller is to buy a replacement strap. We will, but I hope this buckle stays in place better."
2.0,"Comfy, sexy, but not the best quality.<br />I bought 4 in different colors. One of them I wash and got ruined (pocka dots) .<br />And I didn’t even wore it. And others are ok. The black and dark colors are ok to buy if you are looking for something cheap, easy to put on and just couple of times. They kind of have a scent to them even after washing. I would wear them for pajamas that’s how soft they are."
2.0,"I loved the color and the length was great!  I am 5'2"", 150 pounds.  I ordered a large after reading other reviews.  I could not button the buttons down the front.  Too tight in the chest.  I asked to return the item.  This goes through a seller not Amazon, therefore I was offered a 20 percent refund and keep the dress.  It doesn't fit, so why would I want to keep it?  And 20 percent?  It was advertised as free returns.  The only reason I took a chance on this dress.  It is super cute but super disappointing."
2.0,"I saw this shoes had a great deal, and the shoes looked cool, so I bought two pairs for my two sons. When I received the shoes, I feel it looked great, but the quality just so so.My sons have worn it for a few days, and I found it is not that good. My son’s big toes will be exposed when he wears it. This shoe does not protect the children’s toes. I am very disappointed."
2.0,Frame broke first time I used it.
2.0,"Listen, this is 88% polyester and the fabric of the navy pant is a shinny disco look. Nope, not for me.<br />These pants are one of me few returns."
2.0,The shirt hems started coming unraveled after 1 or 2 washes. It was a gift for my husband so it was disappointing that it did this so quickly.
2.0,Cute but too big!!!
2.0,Fit small for the XL I ordered.
2.0,Good for a costume. Not good for anything else
2.0,"Arms were so tight and small, that a child would have trouble wearing this.  Very disappointing....."
2.0,The post are too short gave them to my niece
2.0,Zipper broke after less than 2 months of very gentle use
2.0,I want to love this because the print is super cute. But the bow came apart as I pulled it out of the bag. She hasn't even had a chance to wear it. I bought a size 3-4T because my daughter outgrew the 3T and this is pretty big on her. She is very average in both height and weight for her age (3.5).
2.0,After 3 times in the pool the inside came out now every time she takes it up it comes out rinkles up inside .
2.0,Runs smaller then actual size
2.0,"Looks like a great deal, but quality is poor. Lasted 2 months before seams started busting.  Save your money."
2.0,I ordered 3 pairs and they all got holes within 2 washes.
2.0,"They keep falling off my ears and I’m losing them, or they are just too tight. I didn’t enjoy these at all."
2.0,Not at all what I expected or layered as shown. Disappointed....
2.0,The plaid print does not match and it made the dress look cheap.
2.0,Earrings are big than expected.  Very pretty.  Well probably re gift
2.0,Pretty but Made too small
2.0,"was torn on one side where it was never sewn together, had to do it myself. The bust size was to small"
2.0,Its cute but its a little tight
2.0,The glasses were very flimsy with questionable spring hinges. But what caused me to return them was poor quality control: the right lens had a pronounced spherical abberation (fish-eye effect) that made them impossible to use.
2.0,"Cheaply made.  Elastic around shoulders is very thin & completely worthless. It just causes the (cheap) material to pucker. No way to wear off-shoulder.  The ""lace"" around the bodice is nothing more than thicker, long shoelace type. It wouldn't be so bade except it's not attached in any easy to the sheet (dress), not even loops or eyelets to keep the ""lace"" in place. As for the dress, it's like a sheet of shiny material sewn together.  Absolutely no way to make this workable without doing a lot of home sewing.  Not satisfied with this costume.  Nothing like the picture or description given."
2.0,"While there is extra fabric at the chest, it is only at that spot.  The rest of the shirt is see through.  Would have been 100x better if the fabric was doubled up on the entire shirt.  I won't be able to wear it and missed the return deadline if there was one."
2.0,"It is so pretty, however, it's smaller than expected. Some of the strings get tangled often and it's just a hassle to keep fixing it."
2.0,"The top fit like a small, and it was really cheap."
2.0,Item didnt fit exactly like the pic. Runs big. I am 5'1 and 115lbs. The small was loose. More like a medium. No other problems with item.
2.0,Ordered white and got some ugly tye-dye colors. Only came with 36 pieces. No silicone tunnels which was my whole reason for buying the set
2.0,Faded real bad after a cool water wash.  Dont buy dark colors.  Only good to wear at home.
2.0,It looked ok but the hardware came off after a month and it was way too wide and deep  I was constantly having empty it to find what I was looking for
2.0,"Cute, but there’s no chain included on mine so... 🤷🏻‍♀️"
2.0,Second hand broke within three months.
2.0,"The back was open, so your bra shows! Be aware"
2.0,Ordered 6 and Extremely disappointed that the color was nothing like the one displayed. Needless to say I processed a return within minutes of receiving and opening the box. I didn't expect an identical match but this was more of a meadow/olive green than mint. I don't think 'mint green' is the right description for the actual color of the ties. I gave it an additional star because they were skinny and would have been nice for a suit as intended for the wedding.
2.0,These glasses are big. They were too big for my face. I also couldn't wear them because they were really heavy and hurt and left marks on the bridge of my nose.  I couldn't wear them for long periods of time. If you want a larger frame glasses these are for you.<br />As far as the the strength and the seamlessness that was fine.
2.0,"I had to return these, they were squeezing my left third toe and uncomfortable immediately. Sad because they are so cute!"
2.0,They fall off easily and not durable quality. Unless you have a little one who leaves his slippers on these won't work for you.
2.0,"I was so excited to get this, it's really cute BUT it just wouldn't stop slipping down my face.  It's too big by the temples so adjusting the tips just didn't work.  Bummed!"
2.0,the choker is fine just the pearl is not how the picture shows it and it’s not round
2.0,Leather starts to fall apart after contact with water—too easy if you ever like to wash your hands
2.0,"This dress looks beautiful, but the second time I wore it the zipper broke while I was out at a restaurant. The zipper is long so my whole back was out."
2.0,"The pattern on the dress looks more like a curtain you would see in your grandmothers home. A bead on the ties at the top fell off immediately when opening the package. I am short so I looked like a little flower girl headed to the chapel. You may have better luck if you’re taller, but overall it was not at all close to what I had hoped"
2.0,"I hated them. Ran a size smaller then expected, and the sole stands about 2 inches high making it easy to trip and fall."
2.0,"These are very cute sunglasses, but the pair I received do not have flip up lenses, and I am very disappointed."
2.0,Too short for a cycling shirt
2.0,Even small size is a way too big
2.0,"These are nicely sized, gold overlay w/cz stones that are set in crisscross slant pattern that is super attractive but since so small you can't really tell how great they look.  Problem is that the lever hinge that attaches to post has too much play.  It should snap to the post sturdily but doesn't.  On my pair at least, the earrings can be pulled off easily..they just come unhooked at slightest tug.  Won't take much to lose one or both"
2.0,"I've had these pants on my wishlist for months,  I've been looking at and purchasing competitors. for over a year now. I always find these 'types' of pants too be way too long-  every single brand I've tried!  So, I thought I would try something I could actually shorten the leg and do it in a cute way.  One of the well-known name brand lines actually discontinues a pant like this, so I decided to try this company. From the reviews, I was under the impression I needed to get a large simply because they run small.  Well, the large arrived within my 2 day prime window and I tried them on-  just a wee big.  So, I am going to send the large back and try a medium.  I'll definitely follow up on this post-  as the pants look to be good quality-  let me just wear them a day or two and see how the pull sides work and if they wash/dry well.<br /><br />**Update**  Cute pants, the sides are absolutely adorable!!  However, they are far from flattering around the hips/waist.  They are not form fitting at all, and do stain very easily.  I got the light gray and within a few months have washed well-  but don't get anything on them-  cause it doesn't come out.  The only thing I like about these pants are the side drawstrings.  I would look elsewhere, as for the price of these-  I'd have to say, it's not worth it.  Bummer."
2.0,"actually did not hold my cards the way I needed. Still searching for just the right size wallet ,which seems like an endless job"
2.0,"The seams don't match up. I am pretty sure they are ones they don't sell in stores other than Marshalls, TJ Maxx, or Burlington."
2.0,[[VIDEOID:721973563090e405be30bf1e2c8d3ab8]] I bought these for a specific pair... I cannot wear this pair because of the way they are made...you can’t even put them in your ear.
2.0,Leathers bracelets smell SO bad and there was no way to get rid of that smell so i has to throw them away. Rhe yang from one of the necklaces fell off. The beaded bracelets are the only good items from this purchase.
2.0,"I couldn't return it. I requested the mailing label from Amazon and never got a link for one. This top is very bright colored -- very, very purple, not as the picture shows. I do not wish to own it but am stuck with it."
2.0,Beautiful color but the belt is sewn back to front
2.0,The synthetic socks feel cold instead of cozy.  I would recommend Bombas Marino wool socks which are immediately warm and fuzzy. My brother introduced them to me on Christmas because he also suffers from cold feet. He actually brought me a pair to try and my feet were warm without slippers.
2.0,They’re fine. They bend easily though and the finish is not smooth so there’s a probability of it snagging on your clothing which will pull your ear. The places in some of the earrings where it isn’t smooth could be dangerous because you could possibly injure your ear... since they didn’t take the time to make sure it was smoothed out.
2.0,Beautiful shoe but the placement of the between the toe (piece) thong isn’t right. It made the shoe unwearable!
2.0,One of them unscrewed and the backing was lost - not exactly kid-friendly wear.
2.0,Super easy to scratch and the lenses have bubbles which are strange only lasted about two week not good wouldn't recommend
2.0,"which delivery,  fit and feels well. however,  there was a very noticeable white streak stain on the pants right out of the package"
2.0,"The fabric is soft,true to size. However, it's not that comfortable. I've been wiggly around trying to figure out what it is,but just come back to wanting to take it off. It slides around,even with the perfect fit, the cup shape is off and the straps are pokey/itchy. I've bought Maidenform before and have always loved the brand,but this one falls short"
2.0,Bought as large as possible with these crazy &#34;China&#34; sizes.  The middle band is WHITE and CLINGED to my body (unlike the photo) and I looked like a stuffed sausage.
2.0,Left in for two days and turned my piercing red and swollen! Not real material. Disappointed.
2.0,I like them however the hole is too large and the chapstick slides out.  I will need to sew them to make the chapstick not fall out.
2.0,As the title says this didn’t work for me at all. It’s not the least bit stretchy and won’t go over my hand fully extended. The color is very pastel orange instead of the safety orange in the photos. It is very easy to sway out and feels pretty sturdy though so 2 stars. Might work for you if you have tiny hands.
2.0,"I knew not to expect the best quality, but the scalloped edges looked like they were cut by a child with scissors. It was also dirty from someone else trying it on I assume, which was a big turn off."
2.0,I am A size 3X normally. I ordered a 5X so that it would swim on me. It came and was marked 5X but it was way too small.
2.0,I liked these shirts and they fit good but I dryed them and neither one of us can wear them out again
2.0,"Pros: I really like the lens.  They are a good color and work well in bright sun.<br /><br />Cons: The frames are definitely too wide for my face, but the real problem is that the sides are a stiff, almost sharp plastic that are angled inward.  They dig into the sides of your head."
2.0,The sister charm was scratched up.
2.0,"I bought this to replace a bluetooth hat I had for years and loved. However, this one failed to meet expectations in basically every way.<br />I have an average size head (7 1/8 baseball cap) and this hat is very tight around the forehead but loose around the ears. Presumably this was to compensate for the large, boxy speakers, but it's just shoddy.<br />Not only that, but the spacing of the speakers in the hat makes it impossible to have both on my ears at the same time. Putting one speaker where it belongs leaves the other entirely behind my other ear. The closest I can get is having them both painfully crunching the back of my earlobes against my head, barely able to hear what's coming out of them.<br />Finally, my most minor complaint- the buttons. My previous hat had raised buttons so you could feel them and tell which you were pressing, even with gloves on. These buttons are flush and since you can't see them (as they're on the side of your head) I've pressed ""skip"" when intending to press ""pause"" almost as frequently as I pressed the button I meant to.<br />The good- it is what it says it is: a warm hat with bluetooth speakers in it. It connects easily to my phone and has a good battery life.<br />You're getting what you pay for with this hat, unfortunately. If you have a tiny head this may be ok, but I've already ordered a more expensive replacement."
2.0,My daughter picked this out for her birthday but unfortunately it arrived with missing pieces and the headband was broken! Otherwise would have been very cute.
2.0,"My granddaughter. Likes her  clothes  baggy she wears. a .XXL , I ordered a 4xl, when it gets here it is a size  5xl.  and it is to small.  just beware that the sizes are not consistent with US sizes"
2.0,"Low rise, not for big booty girls cut small."
2.0,"Seems more like a long t-shirt than a dress.  Didn't flatter my figure at all.  I'm 5'2"", 180lbs and got an XXL.  The arms near the armpit area were tight and uncomfortable but if I sized up any more the dress would be completely boxy.  I ended up returning it because it just wasn't nice looking."
2.0,the material is cheaply made. The picture is a little scarier when blown up.
2.0,The gloves are pretty bulky but my biggest issue is the outside layer is not water proof at all. The outside layer acts more like a sponge however there is an inner waterproof layer that keeps your hands dry. Overall they’ll keep your hands dry and warm but it’s pretty difficult to work with bulky soaked gloves in winter.<br /><br />UPDATE:  Got an e-mail from the company offering a full refund or replacement plus $20  on top of that but they want me to change my review to a 4 or 5 star.
2.0,The dress faded the first wash
2.0,One wear for less than 2 hours sitting in a car and Seam is busted. Mind you the hoodie is loose so there is no question as to it being too tight and the seam busting. Ridiculous that it’s so cheaply made. See the photo for reference to the seam.
2.0,I purchased one for my toddler boy and one for me. The toddler boy shorts were a pair of unlined shorts. Super cheap material and look. Mine was sheer and single layered as well. Returned them both. Didn't want to risk finding out how sheer they would be when they got wet if they were that sheer dry.
2.0,"I am so disappointed because this bracelet is so beautiful, but I can't fit my hand through it. It seems too beautiful to give to a child, however that's what I will do."
2.0,The alpha is really built for someone with a long torso. It has 0 support..  it definitely requires a good push up bra.
2.0,Returned : see through. Lacking quality
2.0,The yellow part is orange. If it wasn’t for the LSU and Tiger eye. I would think it was Clemson’s colors.
2.0,"Large bill as advertised, which is what I was looking for. Didn't fit well. The part that goes around your head was so wide that it doesn't sit above your ears. My ears had to be tucked up under it so that it fit. Very uncomfortable. I would not recommend or purchase again."
2.0,Bought this for my husband for Christmas and after 6 months has fallen apart. He loved it when he first got it but it only holds up for 6 months.
2.0,Looks cheap.  I returned this set.
2.0,"Sadly, it shrunk a lot when I washed it the first time so now it’s too small."
2.0,It's bendy but it arrived with a black stain on the white arm of the sunglasses. The stain can not be removed which leads me to believe it's a manufacturing problem. It's rather annoying to see the black mark every time my daughter wears her sunglasses.
2.0,"cheap material, but would have kept as a play dress on the weekend when running around with the kids. sadly the lower half didn't do much for me, it just clung to my hips wrong"
2.0,"6 months after buying the coin pocket blew out.  I didn't over stuff it, normal use only.  Otherwise I was happy with it."
2.0,She needed one that was higher
2.0,"Skirt too long, did not fit correctly.  Sent back"
2.0,"Looks good in picture, but even cheaper life. Tried to send it back to the seller from China, but was told the postage was more than the cost of the product. I'm stuck with it. Don't waste your money."
2.0,"Pretty enough, but sized for a child, less than 13 inches long. There was no size in the listing, but most chocker necklaces are at least 16 inches. Can't wear this without taking it apart and rebuilding with additional materials. Not expensive enough to bother returning, but won't order from seller again."
2.0,"See through and disproportional to human anatomy, it suggested my breasts ought to be located near my collar bones. Also did not flex when squatting"
2.0,Like the style and color and could probably live with fit being tighter than expected but after only  2 wears the stitching is coming out.
2.0,"I was so excited to get these for my daughter and her first period experience. These are the heavier flow ones too and it leaked. For the price these cost, I expected much better."
2.0,"The design was a little modest, but decent looking, but the fabric felt and looked cheap - closer to vinyl than a cotton. It came too late for the formal event I was going to wear it to, but I returned it anyway because of how cheap it seemed."
2.0,Fit was just ok.
2.0,"I love the skirt but it came without the string to lace it up, Ugh what a bummer."
2.0,"It's a nice necklace,  for a young girl or teenager only. Very cheaply made however,  but you get what you pay for"
2.0,wasnt comfortable for me because of how tight these were. Try to size up.
2.0,"The words and patterns are mixed up and down in fabric design but down patterns and words are majority on fabric, which is odd."
2.0,"I wanted to love these. I love FitFlops, where several different styles of the Sandals all sprig summer and fall. They heal support is very good - the whole design makes me want to walk forever. But these did not fit at all the same .. too bad as they are the cutest little slippers ever."
2.0,Poor quality. The side broke within the first hour of use.
2.0,"I was sad when these arrived, they are really pretty rings, but unless have child sized fingers, these are not for you."
2.0,The shirts graphic design is Amazing BUT THE shirt itself is cardboard terribly rough.
2.0,Poor equality and not used for one day.
2.0,"Fake, it is obvious how fake it is. FYI the title says real silver but one of the pictures cleary say silver plated. Also the bracelet is too small. I couldn't it get it around my wrist."
2.0,Cute but not comfortable but u can breath thru it
2.0,Not what I was expecting. Doesn't seem to look a lot like the picture. Quality seem to be ok.
2.0,The fabric is not like a towel is just fabric so it does not absorb.
2.0,"Grandson loved it but it was cheaply made. Within the hour, the seam cracked."
2.0,Thank`s
2.0,"There is a lining on the inside that is silky but no fully attached at bottom so it wasn’t very comfortable. It is itchy at the top and the stitching is horrendous!!! It’s an ok product, very cheap."
2.0,I ordered a extra large and it was too big
2.0,Bracelet is very disappointing. It is dull in color and very light weight. It certainly didn't meet my expectations in appearance. I thought for the intricacies in the design the bracelet would be heavier but it isn't. I hope to return it.
2.0,Frumpy. NOT good for pears.
2.0,"Quality control is poor, mine was obviously missing a stone. Disappointed since they are cute."
2.0,The size online said XL (14-16). The tag in the skirt has XXL. I doubt this skirt is even a size 12. Disappointing.
2.0,I ordered a size large and double checked my order to make sure I did in fact order a large. I was sent a medium. It fits but it isn’t oversized how I wanted it. Returning items isn’t convenient for me so I’m disappointed in that. Otherwise the shirt is cute and soft. If I’m able to return this I will update my review on the correct size (if it gets sent to me correctly). :)
2.0,"Hat is poor quality, was misshapen due to being packed in a plastic bag. Not worth the price"
2.0,"I liked the shirt, but the material was very rough and scratchy. Just trying it on irritated my neck/chest area. Fit well though."
2.0,Overpriced cheaply made item
2.0,I sized up with a 2xl. I have a Grace Karin dress and love it so I thought this would be the same way. It's not. The material is see through and the dress was little. However I love the print of the dress and the fabric is soft. Returned.
2.0,"The material is not very good. It seems to be made of the same material as most Halloween costumes. Whenever you move, it makes a sound which can become annoying. It feels cheap and looks cheap. For the price, it is definitely not worth it."
2.0,"while inexpensive and nice looking wrist adjustment fails, and I could<br />not adjust to my size. Wrist adjustment would not lock. I didn't bother to send back because of inexpensive price. I would not purchase again"
2.0,Not true to US size.  The XL is around a size 8 -10.  Very disappointed.
2.0,Elastic stretched out and made these unusable.
2.0,"This is a cute bag. However, it didn't last a month. Probably less than 1-2 weeks of daily use. The side just ripped out. Obviously, the stitches aren't great. Don't waste your money on this unless you're planning to use this only once or twice in a month with nothing in it but a lipstick and a phone."
2.0,I returned. The stitching on the hem around the midsection was gathered very awkwardly. More material in some place than others so it hung weird. It looked pleated in some areas and then just straight in others. The material is soft and a nice smooth silky feel - which is what I loved - but the overall construction of the top destroyed it. I had to return.
2.0,It’s pretty but broke as soon as I put it on
2.0,"Order a size larger because although beautiful, they run small. I will be returning this item."
2.0,Shirt is nice but the shorts fit funny
2.0,It was shorter in the front than I thought it would be. Strange fit.
2.0,"The top was too small, the modesty panel was way too small too. By measurements, a large should have fit me. I'm a 34DDD and I wear a size 10/12 in dresses.<br />I wear a 7/9 in pants, or a small in elastic sizes, but the bottom was also LARGE. Like I could fit me and my 2 best friends in it with  me. There is no option to order a different size top/bottom which is unfortunate because the outfit would have been perfect had that been an option.<br />The seller was great and I already got my refund when I sent it back. Hope this helps you!"
2.0,Nice but full of wrinkles after washing. Polyester would be better.
2.0,Runs small. Is shipped out of China. So took almost 3 months to get it just for it to not fit. Very disappointing.
2.0,The closure is awesome on the ring but the rainbow color doesn't look like the pictures. It just looks green.
2.0,"cute, but arrived tarnished"
2.0,Honestly not what I was expecting. He length is a bit strange as the top layer has to be a choker to be able to see bottom strand - I may try to modify it. Bottom disk also looks cheap because metal is incredibly thin fractions of a mm. Very unlikely I wear this but it was very inexpensive so not a big loss.
2.0,The description didn’t explain what these were exactly so it was not what I expected
2.0,"Nice shirt but very small for size, arrived with no reciept or paperwork to be able to send it back"
2.0,Horrible... its came kinda tight on my daugther and the first time she ever wore it i had a hard time unbuttoning the buttons and one broke.... why do you have to make it soo hard to open..? Ridiculous.
2.0,Cheap feeling material and did not hold up well after one wash.
2.0,So small you can't read it
2.0,Color was a disappointment! Instead of being the color shown it was more to a pea soup green. This was supposed to be a gift for my son who loves green just not sure about this green.
2.0,I don't like the fact that it says I glow in the dark and it doesn't
2.0,"This Sweat Shirt was so cute!  lots of Bling with the sequined deer and I loved it.  But the fit was way off.  I normally can wear a large with plenty of room.  But this shirt was way too tight and way too long.  Had to send it back.  So if you are tall and skinny, this shirt is for you."
2.0,The first time I used this the stitching Started coming out that holds the zipper in. I did not use it immediately so unfortunately it was past the 30 days to send it back.  Otherwise the leather is nice and I like the color.
2.0,"Beautiful and sparkley, however I bought 3 of these for gifts and all 3 came broken :( 2 were broken at the connections and j had to fix with my own jewelry making items and tools, and 1 the stone had fallen out. Disappointing since it's very pretty :( poorer quality than I was hoping for."
2.0,They are advertised as curvy fit but they do not fit me. I'm about a size 14 (and still losing weight). They do not have that much stretch. They are also extremely short. I'm 5'9&#34; and they are Capri length.
2.0,I wanted red lenses and these appear orange when you look at them but have more of a pink hue when you look through them. Definitely not red.
2.0,Doesn't sit in the shoulders correctly and constantly needs adjusting so boobs don't pop out.
2.0,I am 5”5’ tall 145pounds. Usually medium size (especially stretchy) stuff fits me well. So this pic is me in a mid size dress lol<br />PS<br />2star rating for the fabric and a overall quality
2.0,"Was okay. I haven’t opened all 10 I ordered but the 1st one has a hole, that wasn’t okay."
2.0,Tiny bag...not fit for an adults gym bag. possibly fit for a child's athletic bag if they're not bringing much.
2.0,Made to look a bit cheap
2.0,They are see through. I’m returning.
2.0,These stretch out to quickly and the fabric does not hold up in the washing machine
2.0,"They are too big for my gf.  Despite that, good"
2.0,This product was not as expected cheaply made thinking about returning it
2.0,My daughter only got to wear it once. It shrunk after one wash.
2.0,i ordered a size up and it still fit wayyy to small
2.0,The sneakers look as is they have been worn on the bottom.
2.0,We tried all the colors right away. The only ones that can really be seen are blue and black. The gold and silver are almost impossible to see.  The one good thing is they wipe off the glass easily.  These are probably already in the garbage.
2.0,"I thought I was ordering WOMEN'S socks, but received men's. Very disappointed..."
2.0,Too sharp.
2.0,Far more sheer than pictured.
2.0,"Eww! This shirt is NOT cotton! It says in the product description that this is a cotton poly blend. The label in the shirt says it's 80% cotton, 15% polyester, 5% spandex. My skin tells me it is 100% polyester and my eyes concur! After just one washing the fabric started to pill and socks and hair stick to it like fleece! Wearing it on a hot summer day makes you sweat! There is no way this shirt contains any cotton, let alone 80% of it! I machine washed and dried this, even though the label recommends professional dry cleaning (Its a t-shirt for heavens sake, no one is going to dry clean this!) it did not shrink a stitch and there was no color fading, again not possible with a cotton garment! It has a rubbery bounce and a clingy drape to it that is not found in natural fibers. It will highlight every bump, bulge and roll of back fat. It also hangs on the body in an unflattering way due to the weight of the fabric. Bottom line, David would not approve! Pass on this shirt, the manufacturer and and the seller can not be trusted!"
2.0,Product does not look like the picture.
2.0,Chain Broke resulting in lost black diamond turtle charm  2 weeks after purchase.
2.0,"Not as pictured. Great design but the metal was dark, not shiny and looked oxidized. Just purchased similar item for a little less. They were bright silver and solid. These were flimsy."
2.0,Fit to small around the hip. Looked well made though.
2.0,Very expensive for the fabric. Basically you could make this at home. Over priced.
2.0,Didn't like this color and material. too small
2.0,"The watch says water resistant, but I can see water condensation inside the watch even after briefly washing hands."
2.0,I ordered the X-large and it is too small.  Will be passing it on to a friend.
2.0,There a standard brief size the legs are not longer that very much disappointed me
2.0,Very Small....wont fit in my eyebrow.  I have to return. Otherwise it came fast and safe
2.0,Not sure how this got such good reviews. The leather was poor quality and brittle. I will be returning.
2.0,"I bought a few of these when I first started working in the OR. They got the job done and got to me quickly (since I needed them right away). After the first wash through the hospital laundering sevice, they shrunk substantially and no longer had the poofy bouffant look and started to hurt my ears because they were too tight. I ended up getting quite a few better quality,  hand-made caps on etsy that I loved way more in the european style. I gave these amazon ones to a few of our new hire gals that needed caps and they complained of the same issues. Honestly don't waste your money on these and just buy from a small business instead. Most are the same price or less for better quality."
2.0,"It is not the same shirt in the main photo. Much smaller, and not the same color."
2.0,"This is a very nice small crossbody bag, the quality is excellent.  Unfortunately the description says ""Strap Length: 62 in Strap Drop: 31 in"".  I measured the strap, it is 54 inches from side to side and the stap drop is actually 26 inches, which isn't long enough for me so I had to return the bag."
2.0,"Lookin for non luxotica sunglasses. These may work, I wore them 10-20 times but I know before even my tenth time of wearing the plastic cushion on the inner right side fell off. Might not be a big deal for some but its off center now and i feel that. I hadn't even broken in the glasses yet. I kept it in its case and it was stationary never dropped.  10 dollar glasses and practically paid 50 cents per use"
2.0,"I really wanted these to fit. I love the shark design. To top it off the price is great. However, if you're athletic, there is no way that these thighs will fit. They were pretty uncomfortable and definitely not something you can wear in public. Sadly, returning."
2.0,The sleeves especially were too small. Definitely not true to size.
2.0,They are cute but will tarnish FAST!
2.0,It looks like the picture which is why I gave it two starts BUT the quality is terrible. I was expecting cheap quality bc of price but you could see thick white stitching at the seems which is why I returned it.
2.0,Cheaply made but fine for a cute earring for the night. They turn your ears green but I mean for the price you get what you get.
2.0,Size chart is off.
2.0,Product came and although the fabric is nice there is no Sean at the bottom which concerns me and it did not come with a belt.
2.0,Cute but did not fit on me like as expected. Small in the hips and thighs and very large on the top!
2.0,I guess you get what you pay for. They are ok but not what I expected. Definitely getting a better quality sturdy hat. ( they come rolled up so you have to place under something heavy to flatten them for couple days. Even then it’s crappy looking)
2.0,Broke when putting it on
2.0,The price speaks for quality. The strap is very thin and you will notice the lint. The lock looks very soft. I think i need to support the lock with cable tie or tie wrap.
2.0,"This item was true to size, but I did not like the fabric.  It was a little bit shiny and almost silky feeling. I didn’t expect a heavy fleece sweatshirt, but I was looking for something that would be more like a jeraey knit, or t-shirt material. I returned this item."
2.0,It is very cheaply made....
2.0,"This swimsuit is very cute, i was.disappointed, I'm 5 '1' with a big butt . And I order a big size. Knowing from what i hear always order a big size!  Well its way too big , my butt cheeks keep coming out ,  around my breast areas is wayyyy too lose .. i wash it hoping it would shrink little, but needless to say waisted money there . Next time when i have the the money i will order size smaller. Because i do love it."
2.0,"These were exactly as advertised - for the first two months. Then suddenly, they sprang a leak at one of the finger seams."
2.0,ran small.  ended up giving them away
2.0,Not sure about reviews saying this shirt is so soft - it literally feels like plastic. The “tie dye” is screen printed so it looks terribly fake and the whole shirt had a weird chemical-like smell. It looks cute enough but such awful quality that it needs to go back.
2.0,"This fit very small. I am 5'4""& a size 12/14 and the dress fit (snugly), but the real issue was the length. It barely covereded my rear, but it looks the same as pictured."
2.0,The quality was not good and smaller than I expected.
2.0,"Comfortable fabric, that's the only plus behind the product.  I wasted money on this item, 3 of the six pairs have torn to the point I had to throw away."
2.0,sizing seemed incorrect - had to return
2.0,I like the color but the dress is not fit to true size. The small was too large for me. I am 5’4 and 130lb. The material feels and looks cheap. I will be sending back.
2.0,"I really loved this watch, I didn't wear it to death, but it died. The battery is supposed to last 2 years, and mine lasted less than one year while I wasn't wearing it much. I have to go get the battery replaced. Feels like I got duped...good price, pretty watch...but you have to keep upkeep. I prefer to spend more and have my watch simply work."
2.0,"Ok I always wear a large and bought a xl due to all the reviews saying it run a little small. It is nice looking but... The pants are a bit big and would need to take them in. (I am size 12 40D) The xl said the chest was big enough for 43, NOT even close.  I was able to button the top 3 buttons. I will have to get a 2x to be able to button up over my chest. Hope this helps someone."
2.0,"These are super cute. Didn't wear well at all. I wore them a lot and the bottoms have holes. Too bad, love the design. I also love how Amazon helped this company get established."
2.0,"Not the material I expected. The one on Amazon looks cotton and thick, the one I received is thin and like a spandex material. I wanted it to be baggier like the picture implies. I might exchange for the next size up. Not impressed."
2.0,"I was very satisfied with this necklace when I first received it. I received it quite fast for being personalized. However, I got the cable chain and it broke within 2 weeks. Also, the pendants started to tarnish within a couple days. My mom knows a lot about jewelry and she does not think it is true sterling silver as stated. When I contacted the seller about a return, they said I could not get a full refund due to it being personalized, which is understandable. They told me they would replace the necklace chain for free once I sent back the broken one and give me complimentary polishing pads. I received the new chain but not the polishing pads. I regret not getting even partial refund. It seems like others are very satisfied. Wish things would've been different on my end."
2.0,"Very thin and very large; color way off. Soft material, but overall disappointed. Returned"
2.0,They are cute and lightweight but the top is extremely thick and has no give so puts immense pressure on the top of your foot.  I considered trying to heat it up and stretch it with a shoe stretcher but the material is so thick I doubt it would work so I'm returning.
2.0,One pair broke after one use
2.0,"I liked the idea of a Marc Jacobs smart watch, but ultimately I found the watch to heavy and bulky to enjoy wearing. It wasn’t particularly stylish for something with a designer brand, and doesn’t come with enough features to make it worth it otherwise. Just kinda in between and not noteworthy in any direction."
2.0,Not at all the quality I expected from Tony Lama.  Returned it.
2.0,This is a great costume but the sizing is crazy. I normally wear a size 4/6 in a dress (a small).<br />I bought the medium size and can’t even get it on. I suggest sizing up at least two sizes.
2.0,"The fit is loose, my 6 1/2 feet in the small have wiggle room, so much wiggle room that they rub.  I liked them, mostly for general around the house, but as I wash them they seem to become less soft.<br />The toe seam is quite bothersome with shoes for any period of time.<br /><br />**update-- cute as they are, these are just not good socks .  They get scratchier and less flexible with each washing. The toe seam has become a royal pain. Not that they are getting much wear, so it has been deemed necessary to update here. I am not liking them at all."
2.0,"super thin, and probably wont last very long. returned"
2.0,I ordered my size but it's a little small.
2.0,Lobed the thickness of the shirt to put under a vest and wear as a shirt. After 1 wash they shrank terribly.  The length of the shirt is still good. But the sleeves are approaching too short for my tall child. I would size up for this reason and habg dry it.  Too bad. Loved these shirts.
2.0,I was super excited to receive this dress. I did receive it at a discounted  price of 9.99 for.my honest opinion so here it is.....the dress does look beautiful  just like in the picture.<br />As soon as I started to try it on the scratches began. It is super scratchy! With sequins  clothing you need a nice fabric underlay to help protect the skin and unfortunately  this will not do.<br />Also This could just be my body type but my butt cheeks were about to show  at any moment. I wish the dress was just about an inch or 2 .longer and there was a nice underlying material to Shield from the sequins.
2.0,"When I first received this top, I thought I received the wrong one. The pictures don’t do a good job of showing you the sides. It’s far too tight for my chest, squeezing my breasts, and it is higher cut than what the picture shows. I’m saddened to receive something that I wasn’t expecting. I’m going to wear it to see if I can stretch it out a bit."
2.0,"It is too small and the color is a lot darker than the picture I had the purse and I wanted to match it but the color was darker, and when I wanted to send it back they said I have to pay for the shipping when I was buying it they said free return, very bad customer service, but I love guess and I found the new style at Macy's."
2.0,Rough and balled up after two washings. It’s too bad; they fit nicely and I had thought I’d buy more colors.
2.0,These are lightweight and stretch great but are sooooo see through.  Can't wear these out in public. Ok for sleeping or around the house.
2.0,I'm a scorpion and I love this piece only problem is it fade fast but it was very inexpensive so I plan on just getting another one I'm putting a coating on it so it doesn't happen again
2.0,With in one week it tore apart
2.0,"I've tried a few of these type of compression socks. I only wear them occasionally.<br />While these were very comfortable and looked good, they didn't last long at all before a hole wore through the heel.<br />I have come to accept that these type of socks (full length, compression socks) are expensive and don't last as long as most socks, I felt that the life span of these was way too short before holes appeared in the heels"
2.0,Disappointed.  I ordered a size smaller than what my daughter normally would wear and it was still huge on her.  Returning.
2.0,"I am 5'7&#34;, about 160 lbs, I ordered a size large in the Chiffon Kimono Cardigan that is categorized as &#34;Red&#34; (black short sleeve with red floral print), it fit perfectly. 2 stars for the design and fit, as I enjoyed the way it looked on me and thought it looked nice.<br /><br />Unfortunately, after wearing this cardigan twice (two consecutive days as a cover up while I was traveling, without washing it) the stitching on both sleeves where it meets the shoulders has come so far unraveled that there was about a two or three inch wide hole. I ended up just unstitching the sleeves from it and having it&#34;sleeveless&#34;- but I was very disappointed that the stitching came undone only a week after I purchased it, after wearing it twice!"
2.0,This is a very nice watch but the band is really big and it is not adjustable.  You cannot take any links out of it.
2.0,cute shirt but i ordered a medium which I have always worn and it was so tight I couldn't even breathe in it. Needed more like a XL with this one. Most disappointing.
2.0,the elastic around the waist is too tight and very uncomfortable
2.0,"The price is right and they look decent.  Unfortunately, I was disappointed because they have no distance only zone on the top.  Each zone is a magnified reader, which not what I wanted.  In addition, they are not polarized, which is all that I wear now, especially reading at the pool in summer.<br /><br />The glasses also have a darker to lighter gradation from top to bottom, which is a nice feature that I like."
2.0,"It fit as expected until washed. It shrank and is now too short to wear. He usually has problem with shirts being too long since he's 5'7"" and he can't wear it anymore."
2.0,Ripped couple weeks later
2.0,I did not like it becase it was too big to suit my needs.  I returned it.
2.0,When I opened the package to wear them today I noticed something was wrong.  And the tiny clasp where the wire snaps into was gone.  So guess I will bee returning them.  I'm sure they would have looked good as I like hoop earrings.
2.0,These do not keep my hands warm when I go out to feed the animals-which is about 15 minutes
2.0,"[[VIDEOID:7f711785c06b4dd3c818663178efaa9e]] Runs small, not worth the price, cheap material"
2.0,The bottom was perfect. I was drowning in the top... to the point I felt exposed. Didn't want to put the effort into altering so I returned.
2.0,Its roomy but the zipper was broke :(
2.0,"My daughter wanted this because she’s into unicorns right now but she’s only had it a couple of weeks and the chain link has broken off multiple times and the “ice cream” part is very loose. I may try to super glue it as my daughter really liked the look of it. She said, “Mom, can you write a review on Amazon so they know what happened to my keychain..” 😏😏. I’ll try to upload the pic once she gets in from school.."
2.0,"I ordered it black or dark gray but received it brown, I am a Crónic migraine patient . It is recommended to use dark gray or black sunglasses"
2.0,"The briefcase was large and stiff. The leather is not soft, almost has a plastic feel to it. Inside looked cheap, not what I was expecting. Not worth its price. I returned the briefcase. Return shipping is NOT free. For something this expensive, return shipping should be free."
2.0,They are not for adults they are kids size. That why I gave 2 stars nice but for kids.
2.0,I bought both the XL and the L bc those are the sizes I typically wear. The XL top was entirely too big and the bottoms were too small. The L top was okay but I knew I wasn’t going to fit into the pants. I returned both sizes.
2.0,"I purchased this bra without any reviews hoping  it would be like the photos. It is not. I sized up in the band and kept my cup size the same and the cup size is way way too small, I was spilling out of the bra. it overdirects your chest and squishes them together so you have a single very pointy boob. Not a good look. It’s also lined with weird round shapes like a dalek so I can only imagine you’d have round craters all over your chest after a long enough time. If I could provide a photo without it being inappropriate, I would, but just imagine those pointy 50s bras if you smashed your boobs together and had a lot of spillage."
2.0,I wanted black leggings that were squat proof and not sheer for my workouts. I ordered these leggings in black and they are neither. I was actually quite self conscious when working out because of these leggings… bummer wasted my $$ but now I know just to bite the bullet and go with trusted brands instead of trying to save a buck
2.0,"Putting on this shirt left me speechless. Doesn't hang like the photo at all. I can't even begin to describe how unflattering this was, and in such a strange way. I cannot recommend it. 2-stars instead of 1 because the material wasn't horrendous."
2.0,"I am thin, about 27 inch waist, and got a small. This fits like a large. I could fit 2 of me in this dress."
2.0,The color description isn’t accurate.
2.0,"Embellishments are just glued on, and whoever did the gluing had dirty fingers."
2.0,it looks chinese made (poor quality) chinese is not always bad but this one it is
2.0,These hurt a lot and dug into my skin.
2.0,Didn't last very long.  Leather wore out way before a year was up.  Not worth the price.
2.0,Fit was large
2.0,"Reviews said it runs small. I normally wear a medium. So I thought that buying an XL would make up for the difference, but it does not. If you normally wear a med/ large this will not fit you. The XL is more of a US size small/med. (8-10). I hope this helps clear up some sizing confusion."
2.0,"I never thought I had a big head.  I have two other sun hats, and they fit fine.  Although I do have long, thick hair, so maybe that can be an issue with some hats, maybe?  This hat doesn't fit me well at all.  If I pull it down to actually fit on my head, I can't see because the rim is way down my face.  So I guess it's not so much a better of it being too small.  It I just place it or rest it on my head, I can see, but then it just falls off if I move around and is sticking way up on top of my head, looking funny.  When I pull it down so my head is actually in it, the rim comes down too far and I can't see. Well, I can see my feet. But I can't see where I'mg going.  It just seems a very odd fit."
2.0,"When I first got my blouse, all it took was a single attempt to put it on to get the fact that these blouses are not cut generously. I pretty much felt like sausage stuffed in a casing, so off to mom it went.<br /><br />But she doesn't like it, either.<br /><br />With one wearing (and not even that for very long), she was mentioning to me just how uncomfortable and scratchy the fabric is, and pointing out the fact that there's nothing to keep the unfinished inside of the blouse from rubbing against your skin as you wear it, which proves to be VERY annoying. The fabric itself looks like a cheap polyester (as I imagine it is). So, long story short, I'd recommend you look elsewhere for a nice floral embroidered blouse. This one isn't it..."
2.0,"We've been an ASICS family for years and not sure if it's just this shoe or if their quality has gone down but this shoe feels a lot cheaper than we're used to.  My daughter says she can feel the cushioning in the sole end in the toe area, creating an uneven surface that makes it weird to run around in.  Definitely won't order this one again."
2.0,"Wasn't what I expected, description didn't say soft or hard formed front. So it's all soft, so didn't fit my head so good."
2.0,The cuff part is okay. The chain is shorter than other ones I've bought and I prefer a longer chain. The hoop earring is what gives this a 2 star rating - it's far too small to do anything with. I bent it the first time I took it apart to put it in my ear and now it won't go back to its original shape. The saving grace here is that the chain is not attached to the hoop and can be used with other earrings. Still not worth the price for the cuff and chain. Do not recommend.
2.0,"Great, but gets dirty too quickly"
2.0,"Unscrew easily, don't glow"
2.0,"This is a dress that seems meant for women that have hips to fill it out, but narrow legs, which can be easily fixed with a small slit on the inside dress slip. I bought this dress because I am on the small side and dresses with corsets are easier to fit onto my body. The dress laced up well, and it &#34;fit&#34;, but my hips looked two times wider than the rest of my body. This is partially because of the ruffles/flounces, but also because of the design of the dress slip underneath which flares out for the hips drastically and then slims right back in to the legs (which, again, can be fixed with a small slit up the side of the inner layer). I have seen reviews on here where it looks amazing on other women, but it was not the dress for me due to the design for allowance of bigger hips than I possess."
2.0,Perhaps I was expecting too much for this small piece of juvenile jewelry but I found it so unattractive that I could not bring myself to give it as a gift to my 12 year old niece.  It was returned.
2.0,Has a plastic look to it. Would have looked better without the shiny finish.
2.0,not what I expected but it will do
2.0,This was too small and I was not expecting it to have a bra shelf in  it. I was looking for a rash guard to take on/ pull off as needed; not a swim top. I returned it.
2.0,The straps were  of poor quality material that is not tight enough. The clasps are not dependable I was concerned that they would not be intact when we picked up our luggage at the airport.
2.0,I would have given these 5 stars but….These are great pants for the price. Perfect fit especially in length since I’m only 5’1”. Only downside is they don’t last long. I’ve only had these for less than 3 months and I just put them on today and there’s a hole already. I wear to run to the store and that’s it. So they weren’t us rigorously either.
2.0,"Does not feel, nor look like leather!"
2.0,Flimsy and doesn't stand up very well. Second one I have purchased - the first one uses a snap and the snap won't stay closed. Guess I will just give up on finding a cover that stands up.
2.0,Too small even for my 13 year old cousin
2.0,Pretty but broke first time I wore it
2.0,so pretty wore it once i had it hanging some where on its own and it started rusting looking old and yuck ugh i was so disappointed i only wore it once now i cant even wear it because its so noticable
2.0,"I bought these for my husband after I’ve seen tons of ads for this brand and they always show this elastic boxer brief style under liner and unfortunately I didn’t read the details on the liner. Also, the material was a little stiff and the shorts ran small, he did not end up wearing them in our vacation"
2.0,"They’re cute but the colors I received weren’t exactly like shown. I got a solid brown, and black fade to clear. I really wanted the brown fade to clear. I was going to use these as gifts for my kids friends… I can’t give a solid brown pair. No one will want those."
2.0,Cheaply made dress. Not flattering at all. Returned it
2.0,"Iordered 4 of these. They took a very long ti me to come and when arrived, they were disappointing. Very flimsy fabric  Would never give as a gift"
2.0,"For an expensive watch, there are problems that should not exist.  It is a very attractive timepiece but the 3 smaller dials are almost unreadable.  Accuracy of the watch is also a great disappointment.  It gains at least 2 minutes per week and that is unacceptable.  I am very disappointed with this purchase and would not recommend that any prospective customer spend the large amount that I did on it."
2.0,The shirt fit as expected but it’s definitely see-through I think it’s meant to be more of a beachy top. But definitely cannot be worn around town
2.0,"They seem on the small side for 4mm.  3 1/2 at most, but have a small look.  Post is very short.  I'll use in a second piercing up the ear, but am not thrilled with this purchase.  Just not worth returning."
2.0,"I liked how lightweight the material is. I'm a medium up top and large below so I ordered a size large, which was big on me. No big deal, I can layer it. Buttons aren't close enough together so it pulls and gapes around the buttons even when loose. I wouldn't buy again at this price point."
2.0,It's lace is WAY too low and shows your whole boobs! Maybe a DD could pull it off.
2.0,It looked neat at first but found out fast just how cheap its made really quick ... Strap broke and so did gun in the first day. This thing is made beyond cheap.
2.0,"I HATED the gold buttons on the sleeve,gaudy,& cheap!!!!The fact that it must be hand washed lost my interest in your clothing!!!!!"
2.0,"This watch looks great as a piece of manly sized jewelry, but it fails with the black on black readout.  Don't try to use any of the digital readout options when the hands are down by the bottom of the watch face, as they almost completely hide the little screen. I really wanted to like this watch, as black and red are my go-to color combination for almost everything, but I found myself constantly frustrated at the absolute lack of read-ability for it. The ""night light"" does nothing to illuminate the hands in dark conditions; luminous hands would have rectified this problem considerably, or perhaps a true ""back light"" of LED might be better? I wore it for a week, and found myself frustrated with it the more I wore it.<br />Again, good ""looking"" watch, but ineffective at being a ""useful"" watch for me."
2.0,Scratched first day.
2.0,"Too short for us. I think the model in the picture must be about 5' 2&#34; or less. We are 5'8&#34; and it seems the length is only slightly longer than waist length, certainly not reaching down to the thighs as shown in the picture.<br /><br />I guess that's what I get for buying on Amazon instead of going to Marshall's."
2.0,My dress has gotten a hole in it and then the hole created a run. I do not recommend this dress. Not flattering for someone my height.
2.0,Second time wearing it after 1 wash it’s ripping. 😢
2.0,I would like it if it was smaller.  Ordered a small but it's bigger than my wrist and just floats around. The material and shipping were great.
2.0,"Nice in theory, but didn't fit anywhere near close. I usually wear an xl. Would have ordered up for safety's sake, but that wasn't an option. Being a bigger person, the arms are far too small and there is minimal give in the fabric itself, so no hopes of stretching to fit. The garment itself looks nice enough. The fabric is definitely on the cheaper side. I should know better by now than to order so close to when I need something...."
2.0,"My son is 9 yrs old, 77 lb.  I ordered 11-12 yrs old size ( said medium on the tag) and it was just fit.  It also runs short in length but my son is petite so it’s ok.  It did say the material is preshrunk but not sure how much I can trust it."
2.0,"So, so"
2.0,"Bought one pair and loved them. So I got on Amazon and bought the same ones, same size, just repeated the previous order  again two days later so I'd have a few pairs for work. The new pair is huge on me, way too big and baggy, fit and look terrible. Afraid to try again and try to get another pair due to the size inconsistencies which is too bad, because I really liked the pair that fit correctly."
2.0,The shoes are fine recovery sandals with alot of arch support and cushion. The stiff upper straps have sharp edges and rub blisters on both feet.
2.0,"The pattern and color was lovely, but the material was spongy and thick, almost like a cheap foam Halloween costume. I know the dress didn't cost much, but I've occasionally ordered lower priced items of better quality on Amazon."
2.0,Material was shiny and felt kind of like bathing suit material. Could have been a cute dress!
2.0,Long holes mesh design. Might tear anytime esp if you are with kids or pets
2.0,These shoes are so cute but there is absolutely no traction. My daughter fell several times just walking around the tile and hardwood floors.
2.0,"I got a medium, but it was as if I had an extra small.  I liked the sweater itself, though."
2.0,Looked frumpy on petite frame. The lace was pretty. Returned.
2.0,I bought this for my wife. Came on time but product was completely wrinkled and had tears. Send back then was able to get my refund immediately. Very upset about purchase since it was for Valentine's Day.
2.0,The label says 3XL and I ordered an Xl. But it's because it's a oriental brand.
2.0,"So disappointed because the design is so cute and looks great on the model. I bought 3 different sizes hoping that the first one I got was a defective pair. Nope, they all fit strangely...nice on top but the leg part is WAY too wide. They're also very see through."
2.0,"So there is no way to get it out of the tub, and it's so thick I cant even pump it out when I try to have someone help me hold a pump to try and get it into a smaller lotion container. Its given me a lot of issues with trying to refill my bottle with this stuff"
2.0,Love the style but the dress appears different in person.
2.0,"These socks are in no way over the knee or thigh high! I actually went back into my sock drawer the first time I pulled them out to wear to double check that I had not picked up a pair or my regular boot socks. They barely come up to my knees and I have average-size legs.  They are fairly warm and have washed well, but I really wanted the longer socks. Super disappointed!"
2.0,Vneck does not plunge as in pic. Doesn't fall well at waist.  Too short and frumpy. Like the material. Husband likes can see thru and will enjoy seeing the pretty bras he paid so much for.  If I can get past the frumpy feel to wear it. Glad it wasn't expensive. Would go back. Ordered white. Liked the fabric.
2.0,"This thing is SO. BIG. I was expecting something more delicate, but this is more like the size of... a silver dollar or half dollar? So much for petite and cute - this thing is definitely the featured attraction, no matter what I'm wearing.<br /><br />After wearing it for a few hours, I also had to take it off, as the oil was giving me a headache from too much exposure. Not sure what the workaround for this is other than, well, taking it off. Will be returning."
2.0,"Meh, cheaply made and I don't like the band around the neck. You get what you pay for, I guess."
2.0,Not for high impact exercice
2.0,"I liked the style, color, overall looks and a reasonable price. What disappointed me was it started falling apart soon after purchasing it. The fake leather was just falling off and one of the handles broke."
2.0,"After reading numerous reviews stating that you should upsize and the XXL offers ""0"" compression. I am 6'1 and 245 lbs. I decided to order my true size XL and it offers minimal compression, it is very comfortable to wear all day long. The material is guality and well designed. I am thinking in ordering the L size just to get some extra compression."
2.0,Product was as described. It just wasn't flattering at all. Ended up giving it to my teen.
2.0,"Really bummed, I lovedthe dress, but the straps are all wobbly sobby! Ones longer than the other and they don't have adjusters on them. Fits snug on my little b cup but bulges out in the underarm?!?! Ordered a medium 5'5&#34; and 130lbs"
2.0,"Have had this hat for 3 months now and the drawstring strap has already ripped on one side. The rest of the hat has been pretty durable so far, but for how long remains to be seen."
2.0,I wasn't happy with this necklace I gave it to several people as gift and they let me know they couldn't get the clasp to open so they could put it on. I was very emarrassed.
2.0,La talla es pequeña y la tela lisa es mi delgada
2.0,"This dress is very cute, but the size is much smaller than listed in the sizing chart."
2.0,"Boots arrived beautifully packaged, and just super cute. Quality appears to be excellent, but the shoe was too small and the uppers too stiff. The buckles around the cuff ended just at my ankle, and impeded the shoe's ability to bend as I walked. I am an 11W in almost every brand, so I ordered the 11c/d. It was much too narrow, and about three quarters of an inch too short. While I could fit my foot easily, and there was plenty of room for my ankle, the short walk across the room was quite painful, as my toes became jammed into the front of the boot, though my heel remained in place. The zipper on each boot worked smoothly, and I had no problems removing the shoe. I repackaged the boots and returned them the same day I bought them."
2.0,Quality material but sizing is wayyy off
2.0,"I do not like the braided straps, they are very loose and keep falling down. They stretch out even when following the instructions on the tag.  I will not get these again."
2.0,"it printed really weirdly, like it didn't print the white parts on his face? makes him look like a really scary, crusty, old man. really funny though so i don't regret the purchase lmaooo but if you actually want this as a shirt i don't recommend. lowkey terrifying and i would not want to wear it in public lmfaooa. shipping was way too expensive though and it's really overpriced for a normal black tee with a low quality print on it. 10/10 ;)"
2.0,I ordered a red one and black one. I thought the black one would have a blue glow but it is green compared to the ring i already have. Also i ordered an 11 and i think i got a 10.5 because it is hard to take off. I like my red one better.
2.0,Very thin material. Spandex.  Runs small. Very short
2.0,I purchased these thinking they would be the soft almost like silk material. I’ve boughten this brand before and used them for workouts and work. I’m a waiter so I’m running around all night.. unfortunately these aren’t the same material that I’ve boughten in the past.. these seem to be most cotton.. which to be honest if you’re active like me can leave you feel raw around the thighs.
2.0,Poor quality where the heal is connected to the compression gray band had a hole first time putting on socks. Not as much compression as I expected.
2.0,Definitely looks different than the picture and I absolutely dont recommend it to anyone.
2.0,Beautiful coat but its too rough around neck. returned.
2.0,"These are way, way too long. I could hem them, but I'd lose most of the print on the bottom. The material is rather cheap, too."
2.0,"It’s truly bizarre. I wore the dress for the first time without washing it- it was stunning. The construction was a little flimsy, but that’s okay.<br /><br />When I washed the dress however (in cold water) and line dried it, it shrunk. A LOT. I’m so confused."
2.0,Would have been great if it hadn't been about 5 inches less than advertised--not even close to fitting.
2.0,"Although a cool mask..... you cannot see at all out of the mask, so you can't wear it and walk around. Is there any trick to fixing the eye pieces so you can actually see out of them without actually taking them out? Also a bit hard to breathe. Why have a costume mask if you can't wear it????? May be sending back."
2.0,If I would have known that the grippers do not stay in place or the little suction cup thingies could not stretch over the arms of both sets of my eye glasses. I would have left it there. The only really good thing about it was when it did fit onto my safety glasses I did not feel it on my ears. The bad thing and the most important thing is that I did not feel it when they came off while I was working. Yes folks I lost them while working all three in one week.
2.0,Very thin cotton with white and blue stripes.
2.0,The engraving of the letters is of fair to good quality.  But the engraving in the center of the dog tag is very poor quality.  You can not tell what the image is in the center.
2.0,"Terrible quality, very cheaply made."
2.0,It's cute but not worth the $80. Cheap fur and it sheds bad. Horn came bent and just looks cheap sadly. Was expecting a bit more for the price.
2.0,Charm was missing in the necklace! Would've been adorable if it wasn't
2.0,"Really cute but once you get them over your knees, they'd roll down constantly."
2.0,Did not fit well. Too tight
2.0,Hand washed. Wore two different pair one and two times. Ran like a pair of nylons. Split in half and useless after 1-2 wears. Not happy
2.0,"I wish the fit was better! I ordered size 9 wide. The shoe was narrow in breadth in spite of ordering a wide size. The shoe fits so tight and leaves a mark on your feet after wearing for 30 mins. I was using a slide type from Adidas previously and thought of trying this. While the acupressure effects seems fine so far, wearing and taking the shoe off is a process!"
2.0,Broken chain. I got the silver one and it was fine.
2.0,It is small 👎
2.0,"The plastic heater is designed for a particular size neck. It was uncomfortable to wear the plastic, uncomfortable pressure. The scarf itself was soft."
2.0,Arrived without :<br />1.Tag<br />2. Manual (as it was stated)<br />3. Without charger
2.0,"It's a little smaller then I imagined and it's very stiff feeling, I expected softer fabric."
2.0,"Had to update my first positive review. I love the way they look, but sock had holes right out of the package.  I sewed them closed and plan on using anyway."
2.0,I would have gotten a smaller size
2.0,"Looks OK, soles wore out within 10 weeks, completely through!"
2.0,Hand wash..Lint
2.0,This was the weirdest material. I never ended up wearing it despite liking the style and fit. It was basically the material of a stretch outdoor table cloth. I guess at least it was spill resistant?
2.0,This pair of gloves looked like a toy. I am sending them back as soon as the Amazon hub is back open.
2.0,The material is very flimsy. I won't go outside with these on. They are more like lounging pants.
2.0,"Normally I read reviews before I take a chance on a product, but this one got me a little excited so I jumped before doing my research. It bit me. The ring looks great in the advertisement pictures, but the one I received, like so many other reviewers, was cheap, thin, and poorly executed in design. It appears the finished product can be hit or miss with these rings. I'm no stranger to silicone rings, as you can see in my included picture, but even the cheapest of cheap that I've purchased before seems to be a better quality. I'm not so sure this one will hold up very long, and have no confidence the paint will not rub off quickly. Not worth the price as advertised. I'll give Enso a better rating for the packaging it came in, at least the box was nice."
2.0,it broke after like a week of having it and it wasn't the right length for a choker anyway. :(
2.0,It's cute but I ended up not being a fan of the shape. Looks like a tent on me. I most likely will not wear.
2.0,"To me these glasses are way too round, it looks cheap,I just brought it a few weeks ago and the gold paint on the side is already scratching off ,definitely looks better online. If you have a fat face, round face it might work. I truly know there's so many better glasses out there I have a few nicer ones."
2.0,LOVE the dress but there’s a small tear where the sheer fabric meets along the front neckline.<br />I was unable to wear it to a Christmas Eve Gala unfortunately due to the flaw.<br /><br />Hopefully I can repair it somehow because it’s a beautiful outfit!
2.0,"Not a comfy material,  but worked for the costume"
2.0,I found the watch to be much to dark very difficult to read.
2.0,"I was sent the wrong size.  The pants split open down the middle in the back side, however it does stretch and it is very think. If you get the right size it may be nice for wearing outside of the gym, however I would be cautious wearing this product in the gym."
2.0,Beautiful. But doesn't last long. I had it less than a week when the stupid thing stopped and even when I changed batteries it didn't restart.
2.0,Very cheaply made and came as wrinkled as possible. The fabric is very uncomfortable and it fit too small. You get what you pay for.
2.0,"Item is very cheaply made, thin and not worth the price."
2.0,This was a gift for my good friend and I expected it to be better quality. She didn’t even notice the stone until I showed her. Very disappointed.
2.0,"This is a super cute set and fit my son perfect, however if you look at the photos after he wore it once the material is all pilled and pulled on the shirt and shorts, especially on the rear end.  After one wear to the pool! At this rate it won’t even make it through the summer, it looks so ratty, not worth the money."
2.0,They aren’t that bad over all I like that they are sliming. But I ordered a small and they were super tight. Just make sure you order a size larger than you usually wear. But the material is pretty good quality for the cost. :)
2.0,I wanted to love this SOOOO MUCH! But it didn’t fit my breast right and with out a bra the side boob was unreal. Had to return it.
2.0,Love the look of this ring but it turned my finger green so I only wear it for a short time
2.0,"The belt sizes run very small. I have a 32-inch waist and ordered the &#34;39in long 34-36 waist size&#34; belt, and it is still not long enough. I recommend ordering at least 2 sizes larger than your waist size."
2.0,This necklace is pretty and a nice size but is lacking sparkle.  The stone is dull blue and the necklace itself refuses to stay flipped to the stone side.  It is always flipped to the back side which is plain silver.  I think the placement of the chain where it attaches to the stone is at fault for the way it lays on your neck.  Not thrilled with it
2.0,Iron on. Runs about 3 sizes too small
2.0,Not made in Portugal as suggested by photo. Made in China.
2.0,Definitely didn't have full coverage.  Didn't flatten as much as I wanted it to.  Wouldn't recommend it to anyone w/over a C cup.
2.0,quality is not there. This belt will not stand up well
2.0,"I wear a Large so I got an XL so the top would fit big.  Nope, it was not.  I gave the outfit to my mom."
2.0,This skirt was advertised as ADULT SIZED.  The skirt that I received would have fit maybe a 6 year old child.
2.0,I gave this 2 stars because I didn't get a chance to  use them.  The arrived broken.  Quality seemed OK.  They probably would have been really nice..
2.0,"The alloy used (Questionable .925) was substandard, as when the ring arrived the prongs that held the 2.25ct stone were askew (off center). See comments my BF made regarding the metal.  The only saving grace was the stone.  It's beautiful.  So....for additional $ (of course) our jewelry reset the stone in a much more deserving setting."
2.0,"I tried this sweater because I loved the cable knit pattern.  But it's cheap, cheap cotton that would not lay right.  I tried it on, then sent it back.  Not recommended.  I doubt you'll ever be happy with how you look in this."
2.0,"I thought this would be in better quality, but not what I expected. Will not purchase again."
2.0,"The 3 scarves I bought ALL smelled heavily of petroleum--- YUK! I washed them by hand 2-3 times, and then hung them outside to dry for a few WEEKS, and surprisingly, just before I was going to trash them -- they stopped smelling! That was much better than the gasoline smell, but they still didn't smell ""fresh"".... but I didn't trash them OR donate them.... I guess I'll see if I wear them this winter."
2.0,Much darker blue in person.
2.0,"If it stated that this was suppose to be a super thin shirt, I didn't see it. Had I known it was super thin and not a sweatshirt, I wouldnt have ordered it. Also the neck is too big. It had good potential though, I guess."
2.0,"comfortable and nice looking, updated----after one week, the soles are starting to wear into the fabric and shoe is starting to deteriorate."
2.0,I liked the style of this hat but it was much smaller than it looked in the picture this hat wouldn't fit a child never mind an adult
2.0,The earrings did not look white at all. They looked more clear than white.
2.0,It’s satin-ish. Not a thick cloth I was expecting. Cheaply made in China 🤦🏾‍♀️ I followed the sizing chart... wouldn’t even past my hips. I’m disappointed.
2.0,It finally got cold enough for my daughter to wear she's worn twice and zipper already broke.
2.0,"It looks cheap. If I'd seen it in person first, I would not have purchased it."
2.0,Just a waste of time and money when I could have something better.  You pay for what you get.  Cheap
2.0,"Really wanted to love this dress but the quality wasn't there. There is no liner in the dress so it is a bit see thru. It does have a deep v cut, much deeper than pictured. Design also looked a bit cheesy, nothing like what I thought from the photos. Would definitely size down! I ordered a small and I am 5'6, 130 lbs - typically wear a size 4 or 6."
2.0,"Not durable, the button on the fly came off within a few months. It would not hold up to camping/canoeing trips as I had planned. Lots of pocket space but suitable only for around the house."
2.0,"I think this shirt is really pretty and I would keep it. The problem is the lining. There's one in the front, but nothing in the back. What's the point of this shirt then? Either line the whole thing so you don't have to wear a cami, or don't line it so you do. Pick one! With the lining in the front I don't even want to wear a cami because then it's too bulky, plus if you want to wear this in the summer you'll get too hot. Just know what you're buying before you buy it."
2.0,Muy grande la tele no es estrecha
2.0,"I like the fit around the legs and hips but not the waist...very uncomfortable and tight. I have had to unbutton the button when I sit so that the waist stops pinching into me. Everywhere else fits nicely, not tight at all. :-("
2.0,Shiny material. Made in China. Sleeves have no elasticity.  Appears to be cut wrong in arm area.
2.0,Ran way to big for me had to return
2.0,"Not good quality, doesn't stay snug - don't waste money.  best item was the rubber piece that sits behind the ear piece."
2.0,"This is a poor buy.  The quality is bad, and it’s so thin making it see through."
2.0,Fit we lol everywhere but the arm holes. They were cut very small.
2.0,"I'm an old man.  I wear flip flops almost all the time.  These look good and are well made, but they are tight across the top of my feet.  Maybe they will loosen up and I will loosen up a little as I wear them.  You can't hardly return footware like you cannot return your breakfast; it's just too distasteful.  If your foot is a little ""fat"", you might want to opt for a size bigger.  I'll stay in touch. [[ASIN:B001PTHDRS Reef Men's Fanning  Flip Flop]]"
2.0,"These are darker than the original lenses. It was easy to replace, though there's a film on these lenses and I can't seem to get them clean. That are constantly streaky looking and always have to wipe them. I'm not sure if this was worth the money or not. They fit well, but are always dirty looking."
2.0,Did not find them really helpful. Instead if white glare I had yellow glare.
2.0,"I loved it, until it broke!"
2.0,Cute but give it away it was to small.
2.0,this shirt fit very awkwardly and didn't look like the picture (Design wise) at all. It is also very long in the back but not the front so wont work well as a modest dress. I ended up giving it to a friend
2.0,returned it  it was too small
2.0,Clingy material.  Cheaply made.  Returned.
2.0,Didn’t like material used
2.0,"These are super cute but the ones we received must have had a defect. The slippers fit weird and kept moving to the side of my daughter feet, so she was almost walking on the side of the shoe. Had to return."
2.0,"When I first saw the picture of this watch band, it looked like two overlapping straps. Turns out that it is one strap that loops back on itself. The problem is, as you can see in the attached picture, that the loop (red arrow) forms a large bulge. Doesn't look right and open for catching on things. Additionally, the tabs that slide into the watch are thin compared to the standard band and I had difficulty keeping them from coming out.<br /><br />I would have given this watch band 1 Star, but ultimately, it does function, albeit, imho, not well, so I gave an extra Star. I'd skip this one and look for one with two overlapping straps (and strong magnets). I'll let you know if I come across one (like the one in the second picture)."
2.0,The pedant is very cheaply made an the chain is nice but I was expecting something a little more valueable
2.0,After reading the Buzzfeed article about these I was super excited.  I'm a 36/38DD so finding a good sturdy sports bra is always a struggle.  I'm really disappointed with the product and don't get what all the hype is about.  These do not keep your boobs in place while you're running or doing intense cardio; really only good for low-impact work outs.  I would go a size down as well; as I said I'm a 36/38 DD and I got an XL; I'd recommend a large if you're going to get these.  But not worth the money in my opinion.
2.0,I'm too lazy to return but won't use this because the burlap is not adhered straight and the whole base is super light weight and tippy. Wish I had used a coupon and bought one thats sturdier and more attractive at Hobby Lobby or Michaels or JoAnne's. Not worth the $
2.0,I thought this would be a nice product.  The picture made it look like it would fit well and that it was made of a soft material.  Neither were the case.
2.0,lasted 2 weeks. Holes on the toes.
2.0,"Shirt has Material seems to be a little ribbed.  It feels a bit heavier than my other shirts.  They attached a 2-inch piece of material on the bottom (maybe to make it longer?).  They blurred the picture so you could not tell.  If I would have seen this, I would not have purchased it.  But, the fit is okay"
2.0,Necklace is nice but my daughter's skin broke out after wearing it. She now is using it for her dolls.
2.0,"This is a cute idea, but the engraving is so small that it was difficult to even get a picture of it. We paid extra for the box chain which was a nice upgrade. Overall, the necklace serves as a nice symbol, but is slightly disappointing."
2.0,A wrinkly mess.
2.0,"Well i loved the jacket, that was until stitching in the pockets came apart and now the arm pit. Feels quality but the stitching doesnt hold..."
2.0,Poor quality and ran very very small
2.0,Cute shirt but sizes run quite small
2.0,Didn’t fit well at all. Looks so pretty in the pics but not on. I’m 5’9 and 135 lbs so was disappointed when it bubbled at the top and didn’t lay flush like it shows in the pic. Tried it on and sent it to donation 😕
2.0,"I should first day that I bought these gloves to camp with, which includes turning food over the fire and grabbing an occasional burning log. Having said that, I was hoping that the gloves were a little thicker to assist with the heat deflection when using them in this manner. The fingertips of the gloves have less material which doesn't protect them from the heat as much. For flipping foil dinners in the fire they did a good job.<br /><br />The other issue I have with these gloves are the seams on the inside and the fabric movement. The fabric bunches up when you take the gloves off making it difficult to put the gloves back on.  Kind of frustrating when your cooking with them.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I have to give these a 2. Had the fabric stayed in place when taking off/putting on the gloves and the fabric been thicker in the fingertips i would have rated them 4/5."
2.0,"The clasp would not open. I gave it two stars instead of one, only because it’s a pretty necklace."
2.0,"Too bulky, it does not spin from the sides"
2.0,"Literally takes so much out of me to unscrew the crown, so it doesn't even matter if it helps you out on the exam."
2.0,"Definitely not cut in the same way as the picture, but it's a cute top and the material is decent.<br /><br />It's VERY long! More of tunic top than anything."
2.0,"I bought the XL, and it was still too small, even after checking the sizes. It fits on the last holes, but no room to grow."
2.0,looking at the picture they were a bright pretty yellow but when I got them they were a pale yellow. not really happy with them. the shipping was pretty fast.
2.0,"I don't like this swimsuit at all. The top is too molded for my liking. The bottoms make me feel like I am wearing a diaper. Not impressed and all and definitely won't be wearing this one in public. The quality seems to be good, but I won't be wearing it enough to find out. The fit is jus a little small. I am 5'4&#34;, 155lbs and would normally order a L. I ordered XL and it is still just a little tight around the thighs."
2.0,This bodysuit is a flattering cut and material was not see through or cheap looking. I have a long torso and I couldn't even get it close to snapping if it was longer i definitely would have loved it. So disappointed.
2.0,These masks run very small.  They are a polyester material so they are very hot.  The straps for ears are also very thick and fairly uncomfortable.
2.0,The top was so cute but it would gap open. The bottoms ran smaller then normal
2.0,"I liked the design on this but the necklace broke after a few weeks and the pendant itself turns a darkish color after a while, maybe it is oxidizing.. I don't know.  Its just kinda cheap I guess."
2.0,"Barely got it over my hips and the straps are much larger than what is shown in the picture. May be for someone with a larger chest. I ordered xl. Sending it back. I'm 5' 3&#34; between 185 and 190 34 chest, 32 waist, and 45 hips."
2.0,"The fit on these was weird. The bottom was wider than it looks in the picture. If you have larger hips, you might like them, however they were kind of snug around the legs and kept creeping up. Didn't care for them. Returned."
2.0,"CONS: fabric smell, bad fabric, and materials, fits stiff has no movement.<br />PROS: style"
2.0,"I purchased this expecting both sides of the large size band would be proportionally longer.  Not so, the clasp side is exactly the same length as the small size.  This is frustrating because this causes the Versa to not sit centered on my wrist.  The quality of the band seems fine, just not what I understood I was buying."
2.0,"Nice colors but tight on the ears and very uncomfortable, smaller then I thought"
2.0,So cute but hard to wash
2.0,This ha a bottom and folds easy. I reinforced  the handles  with cord and duct tape. The second use the handles  broke so I used gorilla tape a cord .
2.0,"I’m not a fan, the material while soft enough, is thin and shiny, not cottony and sorta too stretchy. Maybe too big? Idk just something I didn’t love about the fit. I ordered the L and that’s my size typically, it’s very roomy."
2.0,not the material in the picture but still a cute dress. a little disappointed
2.0,I love this but it fell apart in 6 months. There is no way to fix it or repair the damages. Very disappointed in the poor quality.
2.0,"The sweater is a little more red than burgundy. The arms are very tight and the front sides are about 4&#34; from meeting, yet the length of the sleeves are 3&#34; too long. I usually wear a women's small. The material is also very thin and a little stretchy."
2.0,Eh.. nothing special.
2.0,This is very short and a rough material. I wanted it for a swimsuit cover up but it came to my hips. I’m almost 5’9 for reference.
2.0,Disappointed. Came fast but much smaller than expected. It also doesn't seem very sturdy when viewing it in person and more flimsy.
2.0,Very nice but top was too small
2.0,Too long... not good quality.
2.0,"Needs to fit bigger, and have more insulation. I froze the 1st time I wore it, and after that my movements were hindered by adding layers. Looks cool though"
2.0,"Beautiful dress but runs small in the chest, very small.  I'm a 42 c and I couldn't button the dress across my chest.  Fit otherwise."
2.0,"Not what I expected , doesn't have thpolished look that it's advertised as. Really thin material and slightly small"
2.0,The cross cross in the back fell much higher than depicted and the material was very thin and sheer. I sent it back
2.0,Not cut well<br />Very small
2.0,"I'm 5'5, 150lb, Measurements: B:38B, W:30in, Hips: 38in. The reason for the 2 star rating is that the material felt and looked really really cheap. I'm a frequent buyer of cheap swimsuits from Amazon, so my standards are pretty low. In my opinion, you can definitely find a higher quality suit for the price on Amazon. The material is really thin and doesn't have any stretch to it. Even if I had ordered one size smaller, I don't think it would've had that &quot;firm&quot; feel that swimsuits typically have. Also - if you don't have an hourglass figure like the girl in the pic, I wouldn't but it. I have an athletic shape and as you can see in my pictures...it's not flattering at all. However, the fact that it looks bad on me has nothing to do with my opinion...it was based purely on the material."
2.0,Material is very thin! I received 1 pair with 2 holes in them and another that was sewn crooked with thread exposed.... very disappointed! These would have been perfect for our 2 yr old to wear under her dresses....😔
2.0,I received a defective one that has rip inside. I like the length and design. You get what you paid for kinda feeling...
2.0,Doesn’t fit like Xlarge
2.0,Dislike. Weird fit
2.0,"I have a Jetstream from 4-5 years ago that has been my go-to coat for hunting and playing in the woods.  It blocked wind well, shed water well, fit right, was flexible, basically did everything well for a lightweight coat.  The experience with that coat is what led me to buying a second one for use in rainy Seattle weather.<br /><br />The new version seems like a totally different coat.  It fits weird on the shoulders so the lapel doesn't lay flat and always flops way open exposing the interior of the jacket.  It blocks some wind, but not as well as the old model.  The cuffs are cut at a weird angle and don't lay flat.  A 30 min walk in light rain was enough to soak through the new version, again I think this is due to the change in the shoulder/lapel design which retains water rather than sluff it off.  Really disappointed in this version and absolutely cannot recommend it considering the price."
2.0,Bracket doesn’t sparkle or reflect as stated in listing or product description. Hard to fasten.
2.0,It's a very nice gift and the prices was even better but for any charm the seller should put the size of the item up... This bead wasn't the size o thought it would be!
2.0,"The material was like a spandex feel, did not like that. I thought it would be cotton. Will be returning."
2.0,No 30 pairs...Too small
2.0,I bought this watch a little over a year ago and yesterday it stopped working. It’s dead! I really liked the way it looked and it worked fine for a while. I guess you get what you pay for here. I thought it would last a little longer then a year. I know it wasn’t that much money but not sure if I should take a chance and buy another one.
2.0,Got these for my dad and he liked them at first but soon found out that they shrink in the sun. He had to get a whole other pair somewhere else
2.0,The dress would be great IF the one I purchased had been cut like pictured one.  I got the one with the bullseyes over my breasts.  Returning.
2.0,"It is VERY loose. Got a small and it fit more like a M or L. That wouldnhave been ok BUT the quality was not great. Really thin fabric, would have been ok too if for summer, BUT the quality was not great! Threads coming outof every seam right out of the package. No go for me."
2.0,"I had high hopes for these sunglasses.  I wanted them to be stylish and trendy, but as soon as I opened the package, I was disappointed by the inexpensive look and feel of them.  In particular, the lenses look spray-painted rather than reflective.  The shape of the glasses is nice, but it does not make up for the overall cheap look of the product."
2.0,"It was soft and comfortable, but visually felt super awkward as it just laid wrong in the front."
2.0,"I ordered a large wanting it to be able to layer underneath it, and I cannot get my arm into the sleeves while wearing a tank top."
2.0,This top is just not stylish IMO. It looks like a short version of grandma's nightgown. There are no identifying tags in the garment which is weird. Overall a big thumbs down.
2.0,"I really like these designs, but they are fragile and break easily."
2.0,"Very okay, REGULAR gloves."
2.0,I didn’t like the chemicals. I didn’t look too deep into it but I know I just got these for my little girl because I used to wear them when I was a child. But I won’t be letting my daughter use them due to the toxins
2.0,Scratched the first time wearing them. Not the greatest buy. They just didn't hold up. Should have returned them when they arrived.
2.0,"Super tiny, cute balls"
2.0,Ordered an xl but it looks like a medium. The material is more like an under armour shirt instead of a t-shirt material.
2.0,"At first glance, you get what you pay for. Before putting it on I can already see issues with the seams. Based off the picture I thought there was an elastic band on both the arms and waist; there is not. It it just hemmed weird. I am 5'11&#34; and got the XL. It was too short.<br /><br />My teenager tried it on and loves that it falls off her shoulders a bit. She immediately put black leggings on and it was a cute lounge around the house outfit. I was hoping to wear it with black jeans and boots but my daughter will probably ensure it'll never end up in my closet again. She loves the simplicity of it.<br /><br />Overall I'd probably not purchase it again, but my daughter seems to like it. Also, the gray is far darker in person than in the pictures.<br /><br />Edit -- just checked the order and it says it's not suppose to arrive for another month. It'll be interesting to see if another one arrived in a month."
2.0,"Loved the print and fit, but big boobs do not fit well In the dress. And the ties were really annoying"
2.0,Glad I sized up because it runs very small but I do like the vest. Sizing up is recommended!
2.0,Couldnt tell I had any spanx on...
2.0,"These boots are cute and of good quality, however, unfortunately we were shipped the wrong size. So, I imagine the size we ordered would have fit just fine! We ordered a size 4 for my daughter's Halloween costume, but size 3 came in the box. I was really disappointed as this was the second company to deliver these boots in the wrong size, which really left us scrambling at the last minute for her costume."
2.0,"Not for me: very shiny, almost like a plastic finish. Had to return."
2.0,"Not at all like what the pic looks like—much darker than that faded look in the pic. We thought it would be like a cotton-feel t-shirt (as it seems to appear), but ended up being a cheap fabric (think dollar store) with a rayon-like feel to it. Returning and super bummed because it looks really cute in the pic!"
2.0,very frumpy.  Looks like a wrinkled sack.
2.0,I loved this purse. I switch a lot and this goes with just about everything but the outside pocket ripped inside and now I can’t use it. It did fit my phone perfectly.
2.0,Fabric is cheap and feels annoying when I wear my helmet on it.
2.0,"This is a cute jacket, however for the price I paid it’s not worth it. First off, it’s very thin, but if warn with a sweater or thick scarf underneath is passable.<br /><br />After having it for awhile now: It’s very cheaply made. The buttons have come apart from the jacket, the tassels have unknotted and it attracts a lot of lint.<br /><br />This is more worth $10 than $30+... don’t waste your money."
2.0,These are very small
2.0,Fitment is not correct. Way too small
2.0,Cute bows. However the bow that was supposed to be pumpkin colored is actually brown.
2.0,"However, it doesn't change the fit of this shirt. It is too short. It runs small as expected but I was expecting a  normal length. If I  didn't need it asap I would return it. I generally, wear a  size small, in shirts, not petit"
2.0,No where near the right size and can’t return. Cost more for postage. If you are larger than size 14 don’t even think about it.
2.0,Not as pictured. The hat delivered was just a basic beret and lacked the woven detail shown.
2.0,Too small and has itchy material
2.0,They rip easy
2.0,This shirt was very soft but the arms was tight and fit way way small
2.0,1<br /> The sequence is itchy and uncomfortable
2.0,"This looks weird, its huge, stiff and wide. It was like a black tutu, without as much fluff."
2.0,Size down your order.  Just didn't fit me right.  I returned it.
2.0,Cheap uncomfortable material
2.0,"Even though I love the colors and the fit was spot on as what I normally wear, I would not purchase again. I wore it for 1 hour inside of my house and the one pocket completely came apart and ripped off when I put my cell phone in it. Very cheaply made for the price I paid. Disappointed"
2.0,The size wasn’t accurate and fit big. We were disappointed to find the smaller size was not offered in white.
2.0,"Definitely not correct sizing.<br />I've been wearing medium all throughout this pregnancy, so I ordered a medium. It definitely fit like an xs/s.<br />I would order up!"
2.0,I have only wore these a dewberry Times and now already the armpits on material have turned into an odd  color... stained. I have washed theses 3 items and wish I would t have so I could return them.
2.0,Good for one time use as part of a costume but by end of the night the elastic had over stretched and remained permanently crinkled on the back strap.
2.0,Love it but it fell apart after my second use
2.0,fits a little large and looks more old laddish then I would like
2.0,Returned after trying them on. The sizing was off-seemed a size to a half size too small. The quality is definitely lacking. Spend even $10 more and get a better quality shoe. The back of the shoes were cutting into her heel due to the poor quality.
2.0,"I like athleisure sports bras that look like tops for summer. It's a nice way to keep cool and not have to wear too many layers. For a sports bra in this price range I would expect slightly better fabric. I don't think this fabric breathes well, which is particularly important when working out. It could be okay for low impact yoga, but I wouldn't do anything high-impact where I would sweat in this top. To me, that defeats the purpose of athletic wear.<br /><br />I am typically a medium in these bras based on my chest size. This looked and felt more like a large. It was clearly too big for me. On top of this, there's a strange elastic band running around the bottom. I suppose it's to keep it to your body, but a feature like that would make more sense under the breast than all the way at the bottom of the top. I'm not satisfied with this bra, especially with better items at the same or lower price being offered on Amazon. The bra isn't completely unwearable, but there are just too many factors working against it. I probably won't be wearing this one."
2.0,i  like the pants but the they not long in the center like  harem pants are long?
2.0,"Disappointed....but price inexpensive, so you get what you pay for. The hat is cute, however, it was shipped in a bag and not in a box. The hat had been crushed which affected the felt material in a negative way. It has tiny little wrinkles that will not come out.  The hat is made of felt like you would find the squares in a craft store. Quality not very good, but again, matches price."
2.0,Too small.  Too bulky.
2.0,"I bought a green and a red dress, both in a small. However, the red dress is about 3 inches wider than the green one even though the sizes are the same. Needless to say, I have to return. Otherwise the dress is very cute."
2.0,"It doesn't look like hetian jade, I email vendor before purchase for confirmation, so I am disappointed.My daughter liked the style of the pendant, so We did not returned the purchase ( 2 pendents ). Now different vendor sells it as"" imitation jade"" for 7.99."
2.0,The light did not work for long in one of them.
2.0,Super cheap material...
2.0,The legs of the pants were big enough but the waist was so small I couldn't even pull them up.  I gave them two stars because they did look like the picture and were what I wanted visually.
2.0,I like the function of this robe but horrible material.  It serves its purpose.
2.0,"Very cheaply made for the price. You are paying only for the &#34;Wayne's World&#34; logo on this hat. The stitching and seams are weak. The hat is also very flimsy and doesn't hold shape. For the price you could almost pay someone to make this custom. The only reason, I am giving it two stars is because the printing is decent."
2.0,Nice but too large
2.0,"While this does seem like it’ll be a great tote, the dimensions listed in the description appear to be incorrect. In the pictures I attached, the length is only around 19” long and the product claims it is 24”. This is one of the main reasons why I purchased it and if it is to someone else I would suggest looking elsewhere."
2.0,"It fits, but it's a tight fit, no pockets, no fly, are these actually womens sizes?"
2.0,Unfortunately came with holes in the shirts. They were also slightly small and thinner than I expected.
2.0,"The rave reviews drew me in... so much so that I bought 2 pairs simultaneously. However, these left my baby's feet with indentations where the elastics were. Maybe she has chubby feet. She wore the 2 pairs probably 2 or 3 times total... what a waste. I gave 2 stars b/c the leather, when washed, held up well. Just didn't work for us. We're going to try Pedipeds next."
2.0,"I loved how everything looked, but it breaks soon after the fourth or fifth time of wearing it and is very difficult to put on with out help. I bought similar bracelets, just in different colors, and they were the same."
2.0,It broke and was lost.
2.0,"I wanted to love this dress because it’s beautiful, but it’s literally see thru. And it’s black. So the material is beyond thin"
2.0,Looks like paper glued to back. Disappointed.
2.0,This tank would be suitable to wear to bed. It’s very small and the material is thin. I’m almost 5’7” and weigh approximately 150lbs. I ordered the XLrg but there’s nothing large about it.
2.0,"My entire house is hardwood floors/tile and my crawling 12 month old always has bruises on her knees....so I was excited when I found these. I was expecting these to be one of the handiest baby items. The idea is amazing...cushion/protection for delicate knees and also rubber grips that provide traction. Sadly the execution is not what I was expecting.<br /><br />These work wonderfully for the first 30 seconds. And then they slide/roll down my daughter's legs. They refuse to stay in place. Also, the rubber grips should cover a larger area. If you don't get the rubber grips positioned exactly right, your baby will slip and slide and not be able to move anywhere.<br /><br />My baby just turned 12 months old and is on the small side (17lbs- 6M clothes). These are too tight on the thigh area (the top elastic cuff digs into her legs) because of her chunky baby legs and this is why they're constantly rolling down. There is no way these would fit a 3 year old. These flaws make the knee pads pretty much useless and a waste of money. On a positive note, the quality is great and they're very soft.<br /><br />Overall, I feel kind of silly for purchasing these. I would not recommend unless your baby has really thin thighs."
2.0,"This set is very brightly colored but the gold is too much, it cheapens the look because it comes across a bit gawdy."
2.0,"I bought this for my single piercing in the upper part of my ear. The earring was fine, but the backing kept falling off. Returned it."
2.0,"It's OK, but it's very thin and baggy around the shoulders."
2.0,"Wear a 10  1/2 . Ordered a size 12,still very tight."
2.0,Not the material I thought it was!
2.0,I had to send it back because even the XL was entirely too small. Not for people with broad shoulders! Must be a slight frame to fit.
2.0,I was disappointed in this dress. The fit and fabric were well below what I expected.
2.0,"Very disappointed, thought I was getting all black according to pic, I got 1! The rest pink and blue"
2.0,"Pretty purse and colors, although my colors were reversed, grey on top and pick on the bottom. Purse felt cheap and looked cheap."
2.0,I thought I ordered a size 12 but when they arrived they were a size 10. I have big feet
2.0,I don’t understand how this outfit can have any positive reviews. The material feels like stiff thin plastic !
2.0,"I wanted cotton masks- they are less hot to wear. These masks seemed at a good price. BUT when arrived- they have an off putting smell. I washed them in washing machine, dried them in the sunshine.. Still smelly. Next I soaked them in strong detergent, put them in the dryer with fabric softener, still smell. UGGHH. I doubt if I can return them as packaging has been thrown away.  Any ideas?"
2.0,Two of the shorts are smaller than the rest even though the sizing states the same.
2.0,Being a taller person (at 5’10) it’s hard to find things that fit my arms fully. I wore this until I washed it a second time and it shrunk to a 3/4 sleeve. How it is designed the 3/4 sleeve made the whole cardigan awkward. If you don’t have this issue should be great for you!
2.0,I bought a pair of these from Costco and I love them. I wish I bought more. I tried to get more online here even though they were much more expensive. The pair I got online were much to big for me even though they are supposed to be the same size as the ones from Costco.
2.0,Frames were not up to par like my first set of frame. Dont ever use because they are arent sturdy on my ear. Has alot of give on frame. only reason got 2 stars is because it comes with the thing that use connect to the back. i needed it cause i lost my first one.
2.0,This shows it as a long top....it is a crop type top...not as pictured
2.0,little dirty. something's in the surface I guess it's glue.. but color is good.
2.0,"First of all the size chart was way off. I measured myself and went by the size chart but it was still too small. Second, I didn't like the feel of the material. It didn't feel smooth and silky. I immediately returned it."
2.0,disliked this item.
2.0,"unimpressed with these shirts......they run smaller than the stated size, way too clingy"
2.0,when you take it out of the dryer it will become a midriff sweater. not a good look.
2.0,Order a few sizes up. I bought an XL and it was too small for me.
2.0,Ordered large.  Disappointed!  Way too small!
2.0,It looked good but wasn't durable. The band broke within 6 months.
2.0,The zipper pull came off on day 2. I put it back on but had to stitch the end together so it wouldn't come off again. It doesn't hold as much as I had hoped.
2.0,Cute print but no support for the girls.
2.0,The skirt waist is too small
2.0,"I wanted something that will keep me cool. I do tend to be hot all year round but, especially during the summer. Anything to help me stay cool, I obviously want get. The material is soft but, the waist band is too tight. It cuts off and miss shapes you. Also, it rides up. I ordered a size small, but there is SO MUCH material. You literally have to pull the underwear up to the sky for it to not ride up. It too doesn't keep me cool; it actually makes me feel more sweaty and uncomfortable."
2.0,"This fabric is synthetic organza, not silk taffeta or silk Dupioni.  It is sheer and the color is not as bright or as deep as it looks.  Otherwise, the pattern is lovely. I will hang it as a panel and not wear it."
2.0,"the shirt I received also did not match the pictured item. There is no blue color at all. However, I do like the shirt and the cut. I can understand why there are no two alike so I will order another just to see if it is different compared to my first order. I will  share pictures of both shirts for comparison of colors. The shirt is too expensive compared to others offered and to be disappointed."
2.0,The charm was hard to clip on the bracelet & it fell off & I lost it. It fell off once before too but I found it the first time.
2.0,Didn’t worth the money I payed for it
2.0,"The chain did not have a clasp so I had to add one my self. It was way too long, went down to my butt. While I was trying it on, it got caught on my jacket and broke so I had to put it back together. I guess for the price that's what you should expect. I would recommend spending more money for better quality."
2.0,"I ordered the watch for my husband. When it first arrived (about 5 mos. ago) I gave it 5 stars because it looked like the picture and seemed like high quality in light of such a low price.  But I spoke (&#34;reviewed&#34;) too soon.  The watch seems to work (so far) but the band has faded to a pukey-bland-pink and the moon phase function doesn't work.  The numeric and weekday indicators seem to be working. The double-band strap holder fell off within a week; the shiny, rose-gold watch-face trim that looked so nice originally has worn off and is now grayish,rough and dull."
2.0,Chain is too long and clasp broke immediately. We repaired it. It is pretty.
2.0,The sweatshirt was a &#34;second&#34; the .label had been cut out of it
2.0,"The length is fine, but the width is very thin, compared to other tie bars. The picture doesn't really show. So it ends up twisting around easily."
2.0,only thing i did not like about these are they were too magnified under water. made me dizzy. almost like wearing perscription glasses that are too strong for you.
2.0,Within a day of wearing the bracelet over of the charms completely broke off. Not able to attach the clarm back.
2.0,"The pendant is very pretty, but the chain arrived with a broken clasp. The chain looks cheap anyway, so I’ll keep the pendant and get a new chain."
2.0,They fall right off my face! I have a narrow head and they do not stay on (too wide!!) ordered these and got express shipping for a little vacation and I can’t even use them. Even if I wear them over my glasses they still are just too wide. Maybe better for someone with a bigger head?? Was going to give them to my boyfriend but they slide right off his head too... hmm his head is not nearly as small as mine.<br /><br />I do not recommend.
2.0,Fits very small maybe 3 sizes to small. For 2xl fits like large. Sending it back.
2.0,"I ordered size S for my 14 year old daughter since she wears size 5.  And according to the size chart, US clothing size 4-6 falls in the size S.<br />Therefore, this dress is not true to size."
2.0,I’ll give the dress two stars for quality only. I ordered the beige color and it is absolutely nothing like the photo shown.
2.0,"I got the smallest size, and they were very awkward looking. The nose piece was thick and seemed out of place for it, and altogether they weren't appealing or flattering. I bought them for my Jade Harley cosplay, so if you're a homestuck cosplayer I really wouldn't recommend. They were decently made, came with a holder and stuff, but I personally didn't find them pretty."
2.0,Chinese manufacturer that has yet to come to terms with the fact that Western women have breasts.
2.0,These shorts have &#34;Loose&#34; in the name but they are anything but. I'm a 38 inch waist and most X-Large shorts like this fit me fine to a bit loose but these are more of a European cut/sizing. These shorts were tight in the waist as well as through the whole fit in general (tight around my butt and legs). If you are looking for loose fitting I would order 2 sizes bigger than normal. I'm sending mine back for a refund as they only go to XXL and I'm not confident that size will fit the way I wanted them to.
2.0,"Received the wrong item...I got the correct pendant, but it's the version with the crescent moon which is similar so I'm keeping it, but I'm disappointed they couldn't get the one item right. Also, the &#34;glow in the dark&#34; feature isn't that great. Since I didn't order it for that, I'm not concerned about that but wanted to let anyone know who might be...it's pretty wimpy and only works apparently with a little purplish light keychain they send with it. The pendant is cheap, but what do you expect for the price. I just liked the image and I am happy with that and the chain, which seems sturdy enough for a $3 necklace."
2.0,"Love the design, however, they seem to be designed for the aviator-style limbs. I own a pair of Fantails and they did not fit and was hoping there would be enough flexibility in the material."
2.0,Sorry don't believe it is real silver maybe plated but at this price can't complain
2.0,I was disappointed in this shirt. The size was too small and the fabric very thin. It wasn't made well at all.
2.0,Really cute umbrella but my three-year-old daughter broke it within a half an hour of holding it.<br />If for an adult probably fine
2.0,"The size was great (I wear a small top usually), although, it does not lay like the picture. However, I returned it bc there was ink stains on one of the sleeves (either worn before or from shipping?). And the color is more of a dark tan than a beige."
2.0,Supposed to be a men's bracelet I have a small wrist and it does not fit
2.0,The pants was the look and quality I wanted but they were told big. So make sure you be careful when ordered the size you think you can wear. I should have ordered a smaller size.
2.0,It’s pretty but not even a couple days after her wearing it the chain part broke and. It’s some cheap material it seems. We had to get out the pliers and add another link.
2.0,"Chain piece was broken off. Not fixable, but not worth returning."
2.0,Thin filament for the blue light and barely noticeable. Great glasses and all but not what I was looking for. Returning
2.0,Small as expected but not very good quality regardless of price.
2.0,"Yes the watch works and the sounds and lights are cool.  But it is an over-sized plastic watch.  If it had been out of metal and more the size of a real pocket watch, then it would have been worth the price.  If Disney and Warner Bros. can make real watches for cartoon characters why can't they?  Yes it's a toy, but they seem to have forgot that Dr Who has a lot of long time adult fans, who would enjoy collecting memorabilia that doesn't look like a kids toy."
2.0,"Sadly I had to return this sweatshirt. It was just a little to snug around the chest area and the neck came up a little to high, which would have driven me crazy. It was a nice think material though; great for keeping warm"
2.0,"These shoes are very nice, just not for me.<br />I shave a wide foot and these do nothing to make them look smaller.<br />They felt a little loose on my foot.<br />Gave them away."
2.0,I did like .
2.0,"I took a chance but this shirt did not do it for me. The material was rather thin - I wasn't too worried about this as I usually will wear a tank underneath but it is a consideration in the quality. I found the fit to be slightly loose but quite short in the front and longer than expected in the back, making for an awkward fit and unusable top for me. I ordered a the larger of the sizes I am between due to a larger chest but the front ruffles came above the bellybutton and fell long in the back covering the backside - not a bad thing for everyone but it just looked odd with the front so short - perhaps it is my body style but I returned it for those reasons.<br /><br />Color was not super dark - almost a faded black but it was fine."
2.0,about an inch smaller than my other pair of size 13 sandals
2.0,Runs very small. Size up by 2 sizes for best fit.
2.0,they are very uncomfortable! i have a bigger face and bigger eyes and these still felt huge
2.0,I ordered 2 packs of XL's and hot 1 XL and 1 pack of small.
2.0,Too big. Too long. Button fastening is weird. Stretchy loops instead of button holes. I am returning.
2.0,This didn’t work out for me. Cheaply made and was tight in some places and loose in others
2.0,does not run true to size
2.0,Cute and comfortable but it shrank two sizes during its first laundering. Very disappointed.
2.0,It is not a good quality
2.0,Good t shirt well made. Material feels like it might pill up after a few washes but we’ll see. Disappointed with the neck line. It’s already out of shape and it’s only been washed once.
2.0,I chose Okay because I can wear it as a top. I ordered the Black w/ White a month earlier and it was a perfect fit as a dress. Now the White w/ black has been size altered and can only be worn as a top. Later I read that the cut on this item has changed...DISAPPOINTED
2.0,"The blouse itself was too small but was very pretty, my daughter was able to fit it so I gave it to her. ☺️"
2.0,"Been afraid to wear these because the fastener is plastic, not metal."
2.0,"I wish I could wear these on a daily basis but the L is too long. Check out the picture to see the difference from a normal nose ring and these, huge difference in the L. I have never seen a nose ring with this kind of length. I do love the way they look but will not wear for a long period."
2.0,Way smaller than expected - my five year old and even my two year old could not wear them.
2.0,"Very cute top, however I'm returning it because it fits very small. I'm typically a small, but is was way too tight. If I were re-buying it; I'd probably get a large."
2.0,"Unfortunately, this shoe lasted for about 2 day’s before the lights went out on the right foot.  I though it was just maybe my 6 yr old being a bit rough or something but then bought the gold pair for my 8 year old and the same exact thing... worked great initially but right shoe stopped lighting up after 2 days.  The only reason for 2 stars is they can still wear the shoes.  Will go buy Sketchers instead and stop taking chances on these knock off brands."
2.0,"Was disappointed that the color is completely different than the picture. I've seen the scarf in the picture, in person. Should have bought it when I saw it in the store."
2.0,The gloves are way to big
2.0,"The button hole bursed off, other than that it's ok"
2.0,"Unfortunately, this did not fit my car, a common coupe. I read all of the reviews before putting on my wish list for any indication that this would not fit my car. The sellers should have included a compatability list or even just a picture of the back and necessary spots to secure the item onto the car. I was very dissapointed. The item itself looked nice in person, but I was unconvinced that the ties would hold up on the road."
2.0,These key chains were really cute.  But one just fell off the link somehow just a month after getting it for Valentines Day.  So today is March 13th and it fell off 3/9.  The key loop is there and the puzzle piece is gone.  Totally a bummer.
2.0,Love it but it is smaller than I thought it was going to be. My chapter book doesn’t even fit in it. I will use it for something small if I travel or go hiking. But couldn’t use it for an everyday purse
2.0,El material muy malo
2.0,Bought this as a gift and 2 of the glass beads broke after one day of wearing it. I guess you get what you pay for. Its too bad because it is really pretty.
2.0,"It fits my 12 year old, not me. For small bodies."
2.0,I ordered large and it’s was more like an xl or maybe even an xxl.
2.0,"Runs very small and the neck is high and much tighter than it appears in the picture, mine won't go down over my shoulders at all. I'm 5'7 120lb size 3 to 5 and this was to small. The design of the neckline was wrong, it's not loose enough or made large enough.mine is not near as long as I thought ,it is above my ankles a few inches"
2.0,Great just wrong size.
2.0,Very cute hat but it is for a newborn. I bought for my  petite 4 month old granddaughter. My daughter was very disappointed that it was too small.
2.0,"If a can't find a DD in my size I normally just buy a DDD in a size down. I tried that with this particular brand was very disappointed.<br />If I already wear a DDD bra I don't need heavy padding! It's the manufacturers fault not the sellers, but I can't wear this bra because there's so much padding. It fits like a DD, not a DDD."
2.0,I like Nomad's stuff and own three of their Apple watch bands. This one is super stiff and after just three wearings is showing excessive wear - creasing and tearing - on the band where the tang  or tongue of the buckle enters the  adjustment slots. Kind of disappointing. I would look elsewhere for a dark brown band.
2.0,"If I will say those boots are the biggest disappoitment that I ever lived I won't be that far from truth. They are not synthetic leather they are made of FABRIC!!! so just covering feet but not protecting from anything at all.<br />They are just dummy shoes, ""decoration"" , ""look a like""  shoes and don't try to wear them because it hurts all over. The faux fur part is not even attached to the boots at the bottom, laces are attached the wrong way so to wear you will have undo it and saw back the right way.<br />Boots are not expensive but in my opinion real value is not even $10,- . They would be ok as a slippers but not comfortable once.<br />Since I paid 30$ all fees it's not even worth to pay additional return shipping so they go straight to the recycling  bin."
2.0,"Cool to look at, not practical to play with. My 10 year old (Average size kid. 60 percentile height/ weight for his age) can barely fit his hand in the glove. The glove is so small. And we’ve had to superglue the Gems back on several times. If you’re buying this for display, its fine. If you’re buying for play, I’d pass."
2.0,Don't believe it goes up to a size 18. I am under a size 18 and this didn't fit.
2.0,SO GOOD
2.0,"I wanted to love this top.  It fit perfectly however it kept pulling to one side. Stitching off? Not sure, but spent more time the one day I got to wear it straightening it out then enjoying it.  So it so pretty in person though."
2.0,Looks like real deal. But they are HUGE! Im talking about I put them on and they slide OFF my face and when I even slightly bend over- then fall off!  They do not fit in the case that it came with. THAT IS STUPID!
2.0,"Very disappointed in the performance of these. Looks wise they certainly look the part, but they just wouldn't stay snapped....I mean not at all. I showed the women how weak the closure was and she was shocked. Every time I bent over....even slightly, they unsnapped. Not even the respect of a sound to indicate what had occurred. The snap is that loose. I'm giving them two stars as they really do look very nice, and I may be able rig the snap. I just can't recommend these unfortunately."
2.0,Great idea but slips off my head. A wider back-of-head strap would be helpful.
2.0,I only used them twice and just put them away and purchased much thinner masks that made breathing much better
2.0,"I'm 5'10, 160lbs, 38B, 8/10 is my usual size. This top fit snug in the arms and fitted in the waist and hips but nice and professional. Not thin material but not professional thickness either so it will show any flaws or undergarment lines. The buttons are the size shown but the stitch holes are tight in the center meaning they tend to ""look down"" and dangle a little as the shirt settles into place since they're stitched to the looser side of the blouse. Also the cuts went wrong somewhere. The collar is completely uneven one side to the other, exposing a seam that should be hidden. And one side had plenty of room for various bust sizes while the other is tight and the ""under bust"" seam cuts straight through the bust.<br />I returned this as defective and just couldn't see spending the money for a replacement in the hopes it's better."
2.0,"I bought one of these - within two wears there was a rip along the arm seam.  Bought another (cheap enough to do so) and the same thing happened.  This time it actually looked like a hole so might have even been that way when I got it and didn't notice.  Anyway - both trash since you can't repair this material so my advice is to not waste your money on this version.  I have other versions of this top (e.g. the black rose one) and they are stretchier and iseem to have weightier, better quality fabric.  The stripe one is just not good quality."
2.0,"I had this sweater for one day and the collar ripped. It also seems like it would be a lot bigger from what the picture looks like but I actually found it to be be pretty small. Needless to say I was disappointed with this purchase,"
2.0,It does the job but the residue gets all in your hands and finger
2.0,"I am a little disappointed in my necklace.  There is no proper loops to fasten the hook to, just the chain of the necklace that the hook barely fits through and it kind of has to be forced through.  The chain will give and break quickly from forcing the hook through."
2.0,"The bag is a nice size and color, however the material feels and smells like vinyl or plastic. The dye was rubbing off of the bag. Overall I had to send it back."
2.0,Way too big!!! Th dress fits more like an over size nightgown than a form fitting dresses.
2.0,My item was damaged when I received it... it was riped and not from the mail but sealed in a bag and no damage to packaging... very dissatisfied
2.0,...but arrived with a dead battery. I returned it not to buy another
2.0,sleeves were too long but bust size was too small
2.0,"The item looked great but fell apart within an hour of putting it on. I only wore it for 2 hours as part of a vampire costume I wore to hand out Candy to the trick-or-treaters. It's very pretty and looks great, but after 2 hours the chain was no longer connected to the ring and the stone fell off the ring."
2.0,"Similarly to other people who have made a review, though I loved this key chain after a mere 4 months it fell apart for no reason, scattering keys everywhere.  So disappointed."
2.0,I was excited about this dress because I love dresses with pockets! I am 5'6 and about 120 lbs and the dress fit me too loose. It also came all the way down past my knees. I was expecting it to be a little shorter. It doesn't look neat on my  body frame.
2.0,Suit runs small. Definitely would size up for a 6yr old. Also I was missing the tie to the three piece suit and when I contacted the seller they told me I could BUY ONE?!?! Legit it states it comes with one but when mine did not they told me I had to just buy it. If my son didn’t need this suit I would have returned it immediately. Also shipping took longer than prime. If you need the specific suit you’re stuck.
2.0,"Wanted to love these, but I'm only 5'3"" and these are high waters on me after 1 wash"
2.0,Not a horrible product. It just didn’t serve the purpose of what I needed it for. Clasp was too big
2.0,This shirt is larger than the XL shirts that I have. Way too long in the body and sleeve to be the usual LT size.
2.0,"It is certainly less form fitting than in the photo, and the fabric is kind of stiff. But it's not terrible. It still works as a comfy night shirt."
2.0,The belt ratchet doesn't hold and it loosens while walking.
2.0,Too bulky and it crinkled so loud as to be embarrassing.  I donated it to charity organization used clothing sale.
2.0,This dress is not meant for everybody. I'm 5'8 and wear size 12/14 in jeans so I ordered an XL. This dress is so unattractive on me and it looks nothing like it does on the model. It's not loose-fitting at all and the 'waistband' is just under my bra strap. I do not recommend this for tall or fuller-figured as it's cut for someone short & petite.
2.0,"The bag is really large (too large, in my opinion) but lacks functional storage when it's in a locker. There are no pockets for toiletries, etc., inside and when open the flap hangs down and has to be tucked under or zipped up so you can close the locker door. Also, one of the snaps that holds the divider in place failed after the first use.  I much prefer the Ogio SS Locker bag which I had to buy used since it's sold out for two months."
2.0,"I bought a size larger than the chart recommended because I do not like tight clothing, yet these are, indeed, too tight for comfort. Especially in the legs!  You'd think exercise clothes would be designed to fit muscled bodies, but these, oversized, bind uncomfortably tight at the top of my calves. And they are too short so the hem hits just at the top of the swell of the calf, almost like biking shorts. I won't buy more."
2.0,One earring was a stud the other was a dangling
2.0,I am 5 foot tall and this dress was short on me
2.0,I give it two stars because it is poorly constructed the necklace so the center chain came loose and hung from one side when I attempted to wear it However it is pretty so I considered reordering it. But the had the audacity to go up on the price. Why would I pay extra for a poorly constructed item? No Thanks!!!!!
2.0,I felt these earrings were way too small and not as noticeable.
2.0,"Hello, thanks for the fast delivery. However, the hoodie was too small. I usually wear XL or XXL. This hoodie was a XXL but I had to squeeze into it. Plus the material was not that great. It was very very thin. Thanks for the product."
2.0,"When the fabric stretches, it appears white underneath. It only looks white beneath my boobs but not anywhere else so the color looks uneven"
2.0,I like the look and feel of it I think it would be cute if I had a flat chest so I could get it on. The slit in the side is a little too high. Will be returning it.
2.0,The dress was cheap and see through. The stitching was done poorly and doubled over in places. Looks like it was slapped together in a sweat shop. Very poor quality.
2.0,These fit but were too short and I ordered a size medium and I'm 5' 7&#34;. Other than that these pants looked amazing.
2.0,"It's pretty, the vinyl is fine, and the chain is fine. The stitching is not fine. The tab that holds in the D-ring for the chain pulled out a few minutes into my first use and I had to safety pin it back together. This also affected the end of the zipper. The entire thing is going to need resewn at every seam.<br /><br />I still like it but... Beware. Any weight or stress will pop stitches."
2.0,"this shirt is way too sheer, and the sleeves are too tight; my circulation is cut off!!"
2.0,"As soon as I brought out the earrings from the package, one of the little balls fell off.  Didn't give it to the person I purchased it for as a result.  Was disaippointed."
2.0,The umbrella looks good but when you try to keep it open there is no obvious way to do it.  There is no catch which you can click to keep it open.  I returned the umbrella
2.0,Print was off
2.0,runs three sizes small
2.0,Doesnt work as well as it should. I do love the size and color.
2.0,"Too baggy, I didn't like the way it looked, very frumpy."
2.0,Fabric feels and looks cheap
2.0,Fell apart a week after I couldn't send them back.
2.0,"After about 4 months of use on alternate days, the elastic at the waist is completely gone."
2.0,"The paranoid was nice, but it took me forever to get the fishing stuff out. When I did it was all out of whack. The waterproof thing ripped as I tried to get it out. The fishing line was a mess, I ended up hooking myself trying to get it all out. The compass does not work either. Packaging was poor and I am still not sure if I got everything out. I know I am not going to be able to use any of it."
2.0,"The brown and tan are not as shown.  They are like a long brown and tan tennis shoe lace, not a traditional boot lace.  Also, made in  China despite the description."
2.0,"I ordered a size XXL since the item description stated that the sizing ran small.  It did not fit.  I gave it to my daughter, who wears a size medium."
2.0,to tight in chest area
2.0,"I ordered for two sizes, received them in a good time but there were two sets of earings, thankfully not the sizes I wanted, that were missing one of the diamonds in them. Which was kinda a bummer"
2.0,Cheep sneakers.
2.0,I love everything crz and these just didn’t hit the mark. They were Ill fitting and uncomfortable.
2.0,"I really wanted to like these masks and at first I did. The masks stretch over time and become loose fitting which makes them unsuitable for their purpose.<br /><br />Also, when you wash the masks the exhalation valve on the outside comes off, which also makes the masks unusable.<br /><br />*Overall, I do not recommend this product."
2.0,It says it was large But it runs extremely small for being a large
2.0,"I usually wear and XXL, I ordered the XXXL and it fit fine.  The material is really thin and I had the impression from the picture that the arms were more of a sweater like fabric, but it was just the same really thin fabric as the black."
2.0,"So firstly, when I ordered the size L/XL there were on sale for 10 bucks, which thank God because if I paid 50 for these pants?! 😡 Had to cut the button hole so the button would fit through. The hemp (tan) parts are see through, completely. Handwashing is a pain in the butt because the fabric is the most wrinkly fabric, EVER. Because of this, you can't wring all the water out or the pants will be wrinkled to eternity. So when you hang them up pretty wet they just weigh down and the legs/hemp parts looked stretched out and weird. To sum it all up, I'm glad I only paid 10 dollars, because IMO they're 100% NOT worth the trouble."
2.0,Didn’t fit the way it looked in photo
2.0,Doe not block RFID. Just a wallet.
2.0,"Necklace was very pretty and was very versatile. However, it snapped after only a few wears. The wire thread wasn't strong enough..."
2.0,"I ordered hot coral,  but I received a bright RED cardigan. Also the medium was a bit tight on me. So I returned it."
2.0,"Very long, zero compression, phone pocket gets loose."
2.0,when recieved i put it on and it is off center so looks dumb
2.0,Smh
2.0,It's okay. It looks nice at first but it the material wrinkles with wear and the clasp starting to irritate my skin after a few hours.
2.0,dress is beautiful but definitely made for larger breasted women
2.0,I got this dress in exchange for a review.  I've always liked off shoulder tops or dresses.  The top part is great but the rest is disappointing. There is a hem right down the middle and the hem attaching the skirt hits right at most women's widest part. Fabric seems thin and flimsy.
2.0,"These are cute kiddo glasses, but not the best at sunglasses blocking."
2.0,"Honestly, I loved the bag. For the 3 days the zipper was fully functioning. One of the middle zippers busted on second use. I’m super disappointed."
2.0,"Very thin, doesn’t work well if your wanting it for COVID protection"
2.0,"I was looking for pants I could wear to business functions in warm weather.  However, these are completely untailored, more like loungewear. (To be fair, the description does say ""simple style"", but from the picture I was hoping they would work.) I agree with other reviews about the tight waistband.  Otherwise, I'd say the fit is pretty true to size.  Fabric is lightweight but not as soft as I expected, and even though the label says 100% Tencel, it felt like a blend.  One plus is that they have pockets--a rare find these days!"
2.0,"First off, note that when ordering this “tote” bag that it is a little girls bag, it is NOT a large tote for adults to carry lots of things in like I thought when initially buying (which was my fault). It’s very small, less than a foot long and my 3 year old son looked normal with it in his arms like it was meant for his size. I would have been ok with being wrong on the size, but the bag in itself showed up dirty looking and the “holographic” look to the bag was covered in fingerprints as if I already got someone else’s bag they returned (probably with the same issues...). The handles for the bag were very cheaply made as well, thing black plastic I could easily see breaking with the use of a little one. Ended up returning this product, just wasn’t worth it."
2.0,Broke within a month and only used for driving.
2.0,"It looks so beautiful, the only major problem is the screw never stays in, I even tried many different size of screws for the back.. it just doesn’t stay. So sad and disappointed"
2.0,If you like this kind of vintage fit it is just for you. Nothing common with product pictures.  Collar scratches neck.<br />I don’t really think I will wear it.
2.0,"My daughter really liked the design and color of this.  However, when I went to put the filter in, the hearts were upside down.  We will probably use this on occasion but will not be using the filter since the pouch was not placed properly.  This was a 2-pack and both of them were patched upside down."
2.0,Dresses looked nice online but they were much to small when they arrived.
2.0,"Miracle suits are supposed to flatter the figure, but this simply squishes everything around the bust flat and does not provide the control in the abdomen!"
2.0,Buckle was too large for comfortable wear
2.0,"It fit fine, and the print is ok. But the fabric is cheap. Very thin. Shows everything, including underwear lines. It was a cheap dress, so I wasn't expecting much, but I ultimately returned and paid a little more for something better quality."
2.0,"Way too small, fabric is thin."
2.0,"Cheap looking, not shiny at all."
2.0,"The size corresponded with my measurements, but does not protect me against low temperatures"
2.0,Shabby for how pricey it was...spent $14 and feel like I could have got the same product from a quarter machine...guess its pretty though and on time...so 2 stars...
2.0,Like it but just a little small.
2.0,"They are not my favorite leggings, but they are a good length!! I don’t like the material they are made out of."
2.0,"Sock is a little at the top.  I am surprised to find that this sock has a sewn in elastic at the top.  I expected a sock knit all the way to the top.  It is less restrictive than the usual elaestic however, so i am keeping it."
2.0,Tailoring is good materials are good fit is terrible. It would fit okay if you were made like a stove pipe. I ordered every size from extra large to triple extra large and I'm an extra large and was surprised at how small they were. I will shy away from all little donkey products for a few they're not going to fit.
2.0,"Cute, lightweight, thin and easily foldable unfortunately this isn't waterproof."
2.0,"Shrinks upon washing, and wrinkled badly. Not a fan."
2.0,Looks cheat...
2.0,These are comically large. I bought the x small which was supposed to correspond to 3-4t. I'm attaching a picture of them with a pair of 4t pants. . . These are almost 6inches longer! They seem nice and warm if we could get the fit right.
2.0,Returned it.........Looked like very inexpensive costume jewelry.
2.0,"I didn’t return this because I loved the dress but after wearing it once, it picked up everything and looked terrible."
2.0,Gave it the benefit of the dought..not impressed.
2.0,So very see through I had to return it
2.0,I dont think that they worked as advertised.
2.0,Smaller than expected.  I don't think I looked anything like the picture.  I would have gotten maybe two sizes bigger than I wear
2.0,"Sizing is a problem, seems tight"
2.0,The ball on the end of this nose bone is way too small. It pulled out of my piercing 4 times. Three times I was able to find it but the forth time it was gone forever. Waste of money for something I had for 3 months.
2.0,Twisted holders and the color was too light for my taste. They were not flattering
2.0,I'm a large had to get xlarge and they are tight.....already coming unsewn ....around waist of all 3 pairs. And crotch on 2 already ready to RIP afte 3 washes
2.0,"I was so excited to get these boots, unfortunately upon arrival they were too small, and I returned them. The sizing is not accurate in my opinion, so be careful when selecting and purchasing."
2.0,Why was it gray it looked green in the photo and it was white on the inside I thought it would be longer and the hem we just straight :(
2.0,"Guessing game when telling the time, the hour hand is messed up. When it should read &#34;on the hour&#34; or &#34;___ o'clock&#34; the hour hand is always in between two numbers. So when it is 4:00, the hour hand will be right between 3 and 4 (reading 3:00), then will catch up. So at 4:30, the hour hand is just getting to 4. Also, the glitter is rainbow colored and more noticeable than pictured. Really disappointed about the hands.<br /><br />Gave two stars because of the packaging and quality of the band were good. Otherwise would've given one."
2.0,"This product is small for my head so much so that it squeezes my poor ltitle head and cuts off a circulation to my braim a little. Also, the cross that is sewn on is not centered properly; it is lopsided."
2.0,"Because of the brand name I expected better quality. It is very thin material and difficult to put on compared to other pairs I have that are thicker, more comfortable, and cheaper. I wore them once, washed them and the shrunk a lot ! No good. I'm getting tired of so many low quality products that claim to be good. Very frustrating."
2.0,"Bought this as a swim suit cover for our soon to be 17 year old. It did come on time, well packaged even. however the COLOR is not navy blue with gold accent, rather it is navy blue with baby pink, turquoise and goldish accents.<br /><br />If I had wanted that look or even realized from a quality photo... nah, I wouldn't have bought it. It's very thin fabric that must be hand washed and air dried. I am more than sure it will run when washed. The colors should go together, but when looking at it we all just get an off-putting instinct to not look at it EVER needless to type not on anyone. It did fit her, but she hates it also and I will not force her to wear a rag in public."
2.0,They don't look like &#34;famous painting art&#34; to me! Charlie Chaplin? Women rockers? I am disappointed at the visuals.
2.0,Photos make this shirt look nice when really it is very cheap looking in person. The photos seem like there is a fabric difference to the edge of the v neck but in person it all looks like the same cheap fabric. Also I thought I would be able to tie it tighter as I have a smaller frame so the wrap style usually works for me but this is really a faux wrap and there isn’t truly a way to adjust the waist size to achieve the look of the model’s fit. Great photo but cheap top. Reference: I am 5’4” 118lbs
2.0,"Too small for me, more for a young girl."
2.0,"I received racer back bras, which is not what I ordered. They fit okay, but they are too tight on my shoulders, so I can't wear them for very long."
2.0,Looks cute in the package...... you take your chances when it's not US sizing so if you are xl and up it won't fit you properly at all. Smaller people can upsize to get desired fit.
2.0,"Had to return the boots, as the eyelets did not match squarely on the boots.  the return was easy though."
2.0,"When I received this I thought it looked cheap, most of all the material. The chain broke the only time I used it and it kept on pulling my hair.  I used it for a wedding and I doubt I will use it again."
2.0,Pretty  and nice size but gold was chipped on cross and silver was peeking through that spot.
2.0,Has not UV filter
2.0,I am a solid medium but still ordered this in a large and it was very tight and uncomfortable. You could see the entire hole of my belly button underneath it. Had to return.
2.0,Silly design. Makes you look silly getting into it. Silly silly silly looking when on. I’m disappointed.
2.0,"Cool shirt, but the color is not what I expected. This purple is too light."
2.0,Great logo but way too small for the size I ordered.  I have tons of flex fit hats in the same size and they don't cause brain damage when I wear them.
2.0,Looks nice. Fits nice. The belt is small. I ordered two with different sizes (upto 4”) more than what I needed and it still does not fit. The ratchet mechanism that is used also catches and is hard to get off at times. It makes it hard to get off of there is too much tension on it.
2.0,"I wore once and a seam came undone. I didn't buy them small, I bought a large because I wanted them loose which they are. They just ripped after sitting and working all day at home."
2.0,Shorts are cute but waste band is very uncomfortable and thick.
2.0,Really like the colors of the glasses but was very disappointed in the condition of the product when delivered. The glasses came about a month after I ordered and were bent in half. took about 30 min of slowly bending the frames to get the glasses to look normal again. After fixing it the glasses were okay to wear but I expected them to be more over-sized. Smaller than the picture leads on.
2.0,"This is one of those expectation vs reality items online. This set doesn’t look anything like the photo, the fabric is an umbrella kind of fabric, the skirt is too long that they look like a dress when worn together, unless you are 6 feet tall then this will look like a two piece. Another thing to note is it takes forever to arrive, which is expected as it is not a part of prime. The idea of this set is really beautiful but the fabric quality is definitely horrible. (Using my hubby’s account)"
2.0,"I love this case because the pattern was really cute. Unfortunately, after being thrown in my purse, the back was all scratched up and it looked cheap. I had to replace after a few weeks."
2.0,This does not fit an adult woman. It fits a little kid.
2.0,Not a fan of the material. Seems cheaply made but it's ok as far as the fit.
2.0,I would suggest at least 2 sizes up from your regular size.
2.0,"It is ok, was inexpensive you get what you pay for."
2.0,couldn't find a size small enough
2.0,WAAAAYYYY to big for my ears.
2.0,"The fit was okay, but the fabric was very thin. Even with shapewear it showed every line and seam."
2.0,The 2x is not a 2x this is not for a plus size women
2.0,Great hat!<br /><br />Well it was a great hat until it started to fall apart after only two and a half weeks.  Very disappointed
2.0,Cut shoe but if you have flat feet this shoe will not be wide enough.
2.0,It was really nice for the first couple of weeks. Sadly the clasp gave up too soon and wouldn't stay closed. Enjoyed it while it lasted.
2.0,Like the product but way too small
2.0,Slides off my face it's weird
2.0,I had to buy two to get one that didn't leak.
2.0,"The watch looks excellent.  The dial and bezel color play beautifully.  However, the pip is misaligned by nearly half a click.  Very disappointing for the price."
2.0,the posts were too long and the studs fall out extremely easily.
2.0,I didn't like any thing about it since I couldn't wear it.  It was way too small for my head and if I put it on it would crush my hair!!
2.0,This sweat shirt runs at least one size to small. So if you wear a large then you should size up!  It also took at least a month to get it.  I was afraid it wasn't going to arrive in time for Christmas.
2.0,Fell apart after a few uses
2.0,"The case is a little stiff. Otherwise looks okay. However, the mirror is cloudy and smeared. I tried cleaning it with Windex glass wipe but didn't resolve the problem. Am returning."
2.0,one side of the hat is taller than the other - would like to return but need it for an event this weekend and don't have time to find a different one.
2.0,"These are comfy and warm, but they got runs after the first wear (in places that made them inappropriate to wear in public again). Now all they are good for is wearing under other things to keep warmer."
2.0,Not what it is in the picture. It looks cheep as ND like a tablecloth
2.0,Very weird piece. It looks so pretty on photo but its not that pretty.
2.0,"Depends on which one but I bought the cat one and a palm tree one. The palm tree one has a different cut (less high waisted and the crop is normal). This one fits well. I’d say the shorts are cut a little baggy in the front but it’s still ol. The cat one thiugh do not buy. I bought a medium (I am 5’6”, 130 pounds, b/c cup) and it’s tiiinnnyyy. My boobs fall out the bottom and it’s super tight. But the shorts are massive. Unlike the palm tree one that was cotton, the cat one is elastic and isn’t a comfortable textile. Returning the cat one for sure. It looks ridiculous."
2.0,"It’s hard to tell if the ring is pretty, due to it arriving black and tarnished. I have no to have it cleaned"
2.0,"Way too flared at the bottom. I did not like the entire look (top to bottom), very outdated"
2.0,Was not what expected
2.0,"I personally did not like this. I'm 5'5'' 127 lbs and I felt it was very baggy and unflattering. However, it seemed good quality for the price."
2.0,I wore them just one evening and the mesh stretched out so bad and the “velvet” stripes were already wearing off.
2.0,The top wasn’t even big enough to cover my boobs and they bottoms were way to big
2.0,This dress wasn’t a good fit. I wanted to give this dress a chance but the dress is tight in the whole thing but the arms are baggy. The zipper keeps getting stuck in the same place. It’s just oddly sized with a busted zipper.
2.0,Very pretty colors but a very low-quality dress.  I had to cut lots of stray strings.  The material is very thin and cheap.  Run a bit small.
2.0,Way too small. Not worth the trouble to send back. I have grand daughters and these will fit one or the other. Color wise this just looks black not able to distinguish between them. The inside lining color is the quickest way to determine the color of the pant.  There are no size tags on these so I understand the mix up in sizing. These are about 4 inches longer than the brown ones.
2.0,This was a great idea for a Bears shirt but I didn't know it was a shirt from a Radio station. I did not like that at all and returned it
2.0,even as I was taking it out of the package it was falling apart...I had to return it.
2.0,Yes again their clothes are not advertised for the correct sizing. Waste of time and money as I bought them for my vacation. I was very disappointed.
2.0,Didn't really snug my face like i wanted to keep stuff from coming in. Still get stuff in my eyes. Comfortable just doesn't keep my eyes safe as i need. Fairly light weight.
2.0,"While the quality of the materials seems good, there are two problems with this strap. First, it is quite long. I had to tighten it all the way in order to use it, and had to adjust it occasionally as there’s not really a way to lock it at a certain length. Second, the hook protrudes away from the body rather than lying flat against it. It didn’t get in the way while strumming, but made fingerpicking more difficult because I could not rest my hand in the usual place."
2.0,"Gets too hot really quickly.  OK if you are inactive, but no good for a mover."
2.0,"As of now I have to give this two stars, it was fast shipping, but when I open the box and see the completely incorect ring, and two sizes larger than what I ordered, I was bummed out. I will be sending it back, and if I get the correct ring and size the second time around, I will leave a better review."
2.0,What a weird cut...Too much material around the middle even though the length and waist fit great.
2.0,"Wayyy too small. I am 5'6 130lbs, I ordered a medium but should have ordered a large based on the other reviews, but that wouldn't have even fit. I'm wondering if the XL bottoms still would have been too small. I couldn't get the bottoms on and barely could the top. The print in person is cute like the photo though and the material is fine so that's why I gave it 3 stars. Order 2 sizes up"
2.0,Runs small .I like loose and this was disappointing. I like the soft fabric and color ..
2.0,Will not fit as pictured. Doesn’t look like the pattern online.  Not a good buy.
2.0,"Well made, but for an American adult, it is more sized for a school aged child."
2.0,very large I returned
2.0,Does not fit well too big.
2.0,"The fabric is cozy- but the pants are weirdly short- and the hoodie is large enough for two people to wear at the same time- it’s not “roomy” the hoodie is exceedingly large- if the set fit well- would be cozy, but not something to wear to lounge in,.. low price, but you can easily find a better purchase"
2.0,Not soft at all.  Fits really large.
2.0,"The looks are good, but there was no screw to connect the bottom and the top. I saw another reviewer saying the same, I will be nice if the seller could add a Q&A. Finding a screw is not a big deal, but you would think it is self contained."
2.0,"The material is too thin, easy to brake."
2.0,Más grande en comparación con otros shorts de la misma marca
2.0,I love the look and the fit. I hate the fabric I haven’t even worn it yet. It’s to hot and heavy.
2.0,"Super cute, but ill fitting.  If I pull the front down so the seam is under my bust (where it should be)  the shoulder seams end up at my clavicle. It fits perfectly everywhere else and If I go up a size, it will be too big everywhere else and no guarantee it will fit under my bust line.  Sadly, I  will most likely end up returning this one."
2.0,This pin is very pretty but after wearing it a short time the magnet fell off and luckily the pin fell into my top but the magnet was nowhere to be found so I cannot wear the pin any longer.
2.0,"This was a sweatshirt that appeared great from a far but, far from great- at least for me!! This type of top needs a class of its own- Because, ones definition is different when using the word “sweatshirt!“ This has a smooth, thin, sheen to the fabric that is present with some of the cheaper made items.. this doesn’t look bad when seen from a photo- but, as the person wearing it.. I didn’t care for it at all. most likely because, I was expecting something for a different in the traditional sense of the word sweatshirt!! I feel, it takes more than cuffed neck, sleeve, waist to be classified as such.. So, for this reason- I was a bit let down.<br /><br />My next issue would be the fact, this material does not breathe in any real capacity.. it has that synthetic blend which causes sweat and also, static electricity..!! (Tbh, it reminds me of nightgowns back when I was a little girl.. and not in a good way! Fun to wear- but, just as obnoxious!!)<br /><br />The final piece that didn’t feel right and I will own this for not investigating deep enough. Marbled is not dyed material!! It is imprinted onto the outside layer- this is the type when inside out.. it looks white!<br /><br />As for the fit and construction, this seems to be on point with US sizing and made to expected standards for the price. No loose threads or, poor craftsmanship + stitching. This is just taking a cheaper quality blend material and designing into a “sweatshirt” style cut. If, a synthetic thin top is what your looking for- This may be for you.. but, unfortunately- not for me. I hope this info can help your decision… Feel free to let me know!<br />*For reference: I’m 5’2”, 154lb, 38C, 40+ yr. old with trouble spot thru the middle (thx x4 kids and gravity..) The XL was a good fit."
2.0,They ride up your waist and you end up with your belly showing which looks strange. I am a slim individual.
2.0,Very clingy material.
2.0,Dose not fit my calf. Disappointed.
2.0,Not true to size ran small.
2.0,"Sexy and attractive for the price, but white is pretty revealing, it’s tight all over, but especially at shoulders and armpits. Made with the small Asian frame."
2.0,I own several Calvin Klein bras. They are all fairly comfortable. I returned this one because it was very stiff and uncomfortable.
2.0,"Several of the balls refuse to stay on, even when tightened with pliers. The clear one broke when tightening the ball just with my fingers."
2.0,This style does NOT fit the poulan pro woodshark 2150 chainsaw. It has blleder bulb discharge on the wrong side and stops the throttle from working.
2.0,I expected lights on the shirt like the advertised picture and not stars. It does not look right with the stars on it.
2.0,Pattern is blurry and very cheaply printed. Doesn’t fit well or comfortably
2.0,"Looks good, feels good but it isn't so.  They look cool but are not functional as they are too dark even in bright sunlight and are blurry due to flag pattern.  Would not recommend."
2.0,They have very rough edges. They cut me putting them on. I plan to throw them away.
2.0,Much too small! Size wasn’t close to fitting correctly.
2.0,The thong part is very hard and not comfortable wear them for shower at gym and glad that it’s only for 5-10 min a day
2.0,"I did not like the quality of the fabric... it was like those cheap Walmart costumes for Halloween. Not bad if you don't mind that fabric, but its just not for me. It was also a tad big on me or fit weird for reference bust-41 waist-33 hips-42 inches."
2.0,I loved the material and the drawstrings around the waist and ankles. I expected them to shrink a bit and was careful when washing them. But I’ve never had a garment shrink so much. I’ll cut them off and use as shorts. So not a total waste.
2.0,Such a shame as I loved the look.
2.0,The product arrived with a broken drawer.  Returning it and reordering.  Hope the next one is in good condition.
2.0,"It didnt fit right, its too big in the front. nice design tho"
2.0,"I ordered the navy shorts. The material is really comfortable, but they’re not squat proof. I can’t say if the other colors are more squat proof or not. Will be returning it"
2.0,Got my daughter a size 6 it more like a size 4 returning Beautiful ring bummer
2.0,"These socks seen like quality material, but they suffered a pretty sizable tear after just a single practice wear. Very disappointing."
2.0,Didnt like too long. Works if u have a big wide head...and was shorted 1 of each color..
2.0,the product runs very small. save your money
2.0,Dull looking bead
2.0,There are undone stiches all over this... mainly on zipper area. Hanging threads and undone knots.
2.0,I like the idea of these being thin and stylish however they need more rolling on the flare the ends are like razor blades. I now have cuts inside my ear lobes.
2.0,"I have purchased other backless stick on bras in the past and they have all worked well, but this one doesn't seem to stick or stay on well.  It's not the greatest quality.  I wish I could recommend it, but I can't.  There are better options out there."
2.0,Was expecting to love this since I have a few other tops from this brand (purchased locally not online) but the fabric was terrible and also the fit was different (smaller) than the other tops I have which are a very similar style/cut.  Was not impressed and returned it.
2.0,"It’s more like a sweatshirt material, very minimal detail which I like. I ordered a large in hopes it would be big and slouchy, but it fits more like a medium and almost too fitted. I’m 5’3 145 athletic build."
2.0,it’s a pretty simple bracelet. i have a small waist so it’s loose and the rose gold heart already losing color before use.
2.0,"I’ve been wanting a pink gym outfit but this wasn’t it the material was thin on the leggings and slight see through, I wouldn’t feel comfortable at the gym around the creeps. I was really excited about it"
2.0,Fell apart only after 6 months.
2.0,"Very lightweight, plastic, but stylish.."
2.0,"I bought these because I thought they were the same ones I had about 5 to 7 years ago. They look the same, but these are about half as thick as the old ones. They are about as thick as the normal insoles that come in many boys and shoes. Also the old ones had some sort of pine-tree smelling odor control thing the new ones don't have. I loved the old ones, returned the new ones. Waste of money"
2.0,"2 of the 3 bands that came with this order, broke within 2 weeks of wearing.  the first one took 2 weeks to break at the attachment to the watch face, and the 2nd one broke within 1 week at the same place.  poor quality but oh so cute.  will not buy again"
2.0,The white fluff was not even attached it was falling off and looked super cheap.  Basically looked like I had already been ravaged before I had a canoodling.
2.0,The concept of the dress is nice but the sizing is a little off i ordered a 3x based on reviews but could have ordered the 2x it would have fit ok. The MAJOR CON about this dress is that the material is very light and almost see through the fabric is extremely poor and cheap looking. If the dress was made out of a better material it would have been a hit .
2.0,"I honestly don’t believe this wallet is leather. It seems like a cheap plastic made to look like leather. I’m not happy because it’s very deceiving. I bought this for my husband. But I’ll be returning it. It looks nicely made and time was taken to do so, so that’s why they get 2 stars. But it’s just cheap material and not as advertised. So it’s a no from me."
2.0,"I ordered it for my 16 year old cousin and he's an XL but it turned out too small for him and it got his 12 year old brother. So if you have a tall kid, upsize or else it won't fit"
2.0,Excellent material it’s just not comfortable in the back side but good quality
2.0,Very cute. I washed it once and didn’t dry it and it shrunk so much I can’t wear it.  I didn’t even wear it yet either! What a joke! I fit perfect before I washed it.
2.0,nice product but it smells.  I cannot get the leather smell out of it.  I can't even wear the bracelet because it smells. I have taken it to shoe repair and he says I got some bad leather.  He has no idea on how to get the smell out.  So it sits not being able to wear it.  don't buy it!!!!
2.0,Edges had no seam. Poorly put together. Only upside was color.
2.0,I was expecting the loose balls and these are not like that. You have to bend them to open them to put them on which kinda sucks since now I can't get them to look all the way closed. Won't buy these again.
2.0,broke before i got to wear it. cute tho.
2.0,"We returned this dress. The quality wasn't what we expected. In our opinion, this looked more like dress-up play clothing, and less like something for an evening out."
2.0,"The jacket is good looking, but the under side of the sleeves are wearing badly after 3 weeks of occasional wear. There is fuzzing and it  has those balls on it like it's cheap fabric."
2.0,"Very cute outfit but fit kind of awkward. The bottom was a weird material and kind of see through, but the top was gorgeous. Be careful with the zipper as well."
2.0,it is not quite what I am expected as it is hard to wear
2.0,"The basic tub is fine. The &#34;hinges&#34;, however, are a sham.  They pop off easily, are difficult to reinstall, and are a constant source of frustration. I use a tie down strap to keep from losing the lids altogether. And with the price of shipping added on they cost way too much."
2.0,"Took 22 days for the items to be delivered which I was fine with since I didn’t need right away but I am disappointed in them. They are made out of what feels like underwear material and the tan, black, and white flat out look like someone is wearing either panties or a bra on their face. Save your money I’m not sure even vinyl could make these look better."
2.0,"Colors were fantastic, but quality was very very low, wore out first day on the reef."
2.0,"Let's start with the positive:<br />- The color and sparkliness of this is great!<br />- The shoulder ties and neckline are cute.<br />- The fabric is light and would be great for summer or going out.<br />- It's actually a little longer in person than it looks, which means no worries about showing things you didn't intend to while moving, getting in and out of vehicles, etc.<br /><br />Now the not-so-great:<br />- This said it was a small, but it definitely fit like a medium. Consider ordering down a size.<br />- Unlike the picture shown, this had no shape. It hangs like a flapper dress - straight down. That's not terrible if that's what you're looking for, but it was not flattering on me at all (and I have a natural hourglass). Given the fabric and construction, it doesn't look like it could be taken in or modified to look the way it does in the picture, either.<br /><br />All things considered, it didn't work for me at all,  sadly."
2.0,"Weird shape, cheap quality"
2.0,This jacket ended up being absolutely HUGE. Would size down about 2 sizes.
2.0,"I was really excited to get this and based on the green color shown I had it coordinated with the rest of the families’ outfits for Christmas pictures.  I was REALLY bummed when I got it. The green is more like a brown so you really can’t tell it’s green so now it clashes with my families’ outfits. The sizing is way off! I ordered a small and it’s more like a large. The material is on the lighter side, it looks thicker in the picture. On another adventure for something with the correct coloring and similar to this style.. Such a shame."
2.0,Tuve q venderlo
2.0,Lousy fit. Big head don't buy.
2.0,"I ordered the 1/4 carat blue diamond pendant from Neimans Jewelry via Amazon. It's a pretty pendant but it's rather small even for a 1/4 carat size. It is more like an 1/8 of a carat size. I compared it to a couple of other gold/diamond pendants I have that are the same basic carat weight and it wasn't even close. In order to see it on the chain, I had to stand close to a mirror to see the stone. I was tempted to return it but I decided to keep it because it wasn't worth the mailing hassle to send it back.<br /><br />Overall I've had good luck ordering jewelry from Amazon, but there's always  the chance of being disappointed."
2.0,Got a large so it would fit loosely but I don’t like how snug it is in the arm pit
2.0,I wear a Small and I couldn't even get this item on... it was way to tight in the arms and the waist band wouldn't even fit over my shoulders.
2.0,"~If you found this review helpful, please mark it as 'helpful'~<br />I bought this belt to wear on top of a dress I loved so that the waistline was more accentuated and it added a cute flare. However, after wearing it only twice (and with minimal movement/wear and tear), the seam holding the elastic and the pleather together ripped and the whole belt started to split in half. Unfortunately, it is no longer wearable.<br /><br />~For more reviews and/or product testing, please contact @madski21 on instagram~"
2.0,"I loved this anchor keychain when I saw it and it arrived exactly as shown. But after only a few short weeks it has started to corrode, causing it to loose the beautiful rose gold color. The anchors chain also broke today in two spots, so glad it happened at home and I noticed it. I was able to reattach it but for $12+ dollars it should not be falling apart already."
2.0,I wear a large size hat and this was more like a medium tight
2.0,"I ordered my normal size and it was too small, so I was told I could keep it and they gave me a half refund and I gave it to my daughter.  I ordered a size larger and it was still too small and not made very well.  When zipped, the stripes didn't match up and the cuffs puckered, but I got a full refund this time.  The first one was made well though.  Three times may be a charm!"
2.0,"It looks to be made of good quality but time will tell. It's a little tight on the inside which may be a hassle, very small change compartment but over all a nice wallet.<br /><br />Update: Had this for a month and now I'm looking for a replacement. The card holders are not snug. You drop this with it being unzipped everything falls out. It's too tight on the inside. Two stars for me now."
2.0,"Good price, too large. Will have to save this item for next year."
2.0,"the picture makes it look better then it actually is, i was surprised to see it come the way it did it had some gunk on the box and i was pretty annoyed"
2.0,Description reads leather lace up boot!. No leather in this boot they are rubbery plastic so if you’re looking for a leather do not buy this boot
2.0,Purchased for my nephew as a birthday gift. Got the batteries and the helmet lit up for a second but  it shorted out because now it’s not working 😔.<br />Super disappointed.
2.0,"Cheap, clingy material."
2.0,I am an XL and ordered a XXL. They were still to small. Like not even button touching. They are cute though.
2.0,Too big fell right down. Need to return
2.0,"The band is uncomfortable and very cheaply made. Yes, more cheaply made that I expect given its cheap price. It is already peeling up on the edges."
2.0,"A comfortable well fitting sweater. Lasted one day. I WAS roughhousing, but all the stitches came out and it literally fell apart.<br /><br />*I had purchased 2 for outdoor use. Each of them lasted one day. Wore them hiking... but just wearing a backpack and walking through the brush tore them to shreds. I mean ripped apart with holes and gashes. I wasn't even mad it was so amazing."
2.0,Super thin. Completely see through and really small.
2.0,"These are good at preventing the inner thighs from rubbing however they do not last long. After one wash, one of them tore at the leg. The material is stocking like but not as thin. Also the material gets quite picky. If you are looking for something that provides support/ compression, don't buy this item. I was looking for a simple undershorts, but because of the material I expect them to be out of use soon."
2.0,While the pants themselves seemed fine they were SOOOO short!  The measurements refer to the entire length of the pants NOT the inseam.  If you are over 5'5&#34; do not buy these pants.
2.0,"Will not buy again, poor quality! Junk"
2.0,You get what you pay for here. It was way too big  in some areas and poorly sewn when it arrived. Could potentially be cute if I resew a few pieces. Definitely not like its photograph though.
2.0,"VERY thin fabric. Product arrived and already seemed stretched out. Also had a cheap, chemical smell. The color was nice, but that's all I liked about this dress."
2.0,"It's a very cute necklace and perfect summer wear. However, it's very cheaply made and lasted only 5 days on my daughter's neck. The chained clasp portions on the wire completely fell off and could not be fixed."
2.0,"these earrings are pretty, but they fall out of the posts. not a good fitting item. I have sent feedback to the seller and asked for a replacement pair, but received no response."
2.0,"These shorts are way too small. I normally wear a US 3x, so I chose the &#34;2x-4x&#34; size. What arrived was labeled 5x (not surprising since many Asian sizes are significantly smaller than US sizes.  The rest of the label is in a Chinese-like language.<br /><br />I could barely get these on. They're a couple inches above the knee and I had a very hard time stretching it enough to get all the way over my butt.<br /><br />Once on, they're sheer. I *might* be willing to wear them with a very long shirt, but anything less than that and the line of my underwear is completely visible.  May be ok under skirts and dresses if it can overcome the size issue."
2.0,This mask is only for show. Material is much too thin to protect you from the spread of COVID
2.0,Terrible shorts. Thin and cheap.  Doubt they’ll last 2 summers.  The hem curls up I in the back after sitting down and they wrinkle easily.. plus the crappy stretchy material won’t even lay flat. See pics. Returning
2.0,"It is very bright blue - fine - looks sharp. BUT, the material however is not nice. It feels very cheap and is uncomfortable on bare skin/arms. It is also a little tight. I'll probably not wear it anymore. Was surprised for a  Nike product."
2.0,"I got these scissors for one reason: to safely cut bandages and gauze used for dressing of wounds and cuts. After using them for the first time, I can report that the blades are so dull that they couldn't cut through cotton gauze protecting a knee abrasion. Totally useless."
2.0,Cute but way too small. My mom loves it.
2.0,Too clingy shows everything
2.0,YOU CAN SEE RIGHT THROUGH IT.
2.0,I measured based on their sizing  chart efore I purchased and they were still too small. Hope the next size up fits because they are beautiful gloves
2.0,The fabric is gross and cheap. Almost like a plastic.
2.0,It didn't fit nicely on me. the style was different.
2.0,"The hat might have been what I was looking for however, I will never know because it arrived in such a terrible state that it had to be returned without ever having the chance to wear it.  Not only was the top crushed the brim was bent beyond repair.  This damage was not caused by the manufacture but by the hat being shipped in a box that was much too small."
2.0,"I am a size 14 and figured the xl would be more than sufficient, but it was cut very tightly."
2.0,"Returning this.  Design and materials for pouch and belt are not too bad, but the water bottle holder is described as up to 3&#34; diameter.  In reality, it is too small for Camelbak Podium Chill bottle, which is 2.8&#34;&#34;.  Holder diameter is closer to 2.5&#34;.  Plastic buckle is flimsier than most."
2.0,"The product seems to have shrunk quite drastically. I’m using it on my beard for roller derby bouts, it works well enough. It’s quite chunky compared to other products. The low review is based on being chunky and the apparent shrinkage."
2.0,I had high hopes for this dress.  The fabric color is really pretty. It does seem to run a tad small but fit ok except the biggest issue was with the tie straps. They aren’t positioned right. The are too close together in the front and looked funky.
2.0,The metal changed colors on the after week
2.0,These shoes are perfect...for about a month. Then they fall apart. All 3 pairs my husband has have been thrown out after a month because the soles fall off and the colored line outlining the shoe.
2.0,"The picture makes it look like it would be as big as a state ID but it is much bigger, the window for the ID is too big for the id"
2.0,I got these for my two oldest children whom I homeschool. I got them to help them concentrate when their younger siblings get loud while they are trying to do their schoolwork. They are basically just headphones. I could have purchased some $1 ear plugs that would have worked just as well. They are not noise cancelling at all. They do not adjust either. Very disappointed.
2.0,Deformed after about a year of use. For the price may not be worth it.
2.0,The skirt was so long that it went almost to my toes and I’m 5’6”.
2.0,Material is super cheap and discolored in many areas. Shirts to small and shorts are huge. Would not recommend
2.0,This top looks better on the model than it did on myself. And the fabric quality is thin and not attractive at all. I will give it away. :(
2.0,The jacket looks beautiful but had a faulty zipper from the start. Returned...
2.0,I am tall and skinny bought extra large as advised. it was too short on hands and I could not close the coat itself.  Probably it feet only skinny petit women
2.0,"I don't know why people are saying it runs large because it's just not true, it run small, thin fabric"
2.0,"The top is very cheap you need to wash it by hand because I put mine in the washer and the top ripped. I hated the underwear, I got the M and it will burn my skin, the extra strap for the belly doesn’t stay in place and often makes your belly look bigger than what it is. The underwear material is also very uncomfortable for sensitive skin."
2.0,It doesn't stay fastened.
2.0,"Since it was so much longer than needed, I just returned it...didn't bother to ask for replacement. Probably best to just buy in a store where I can be sure."
2.0,"Beautiful watch, just gorgeous. Only disappointing part is after two days it doesn't work."
2.0,The fit was my size there is just zero support
2.0,"I actually love the dress, but the sizing is VERY INACCURATE. I ordered a XX- Large and it fits like a Medium."
2.0,I’m almost 5’7” and this was extremely short...well above my ankles. Returning.
2.0,"I did not receive snakeskin mine were plain, so it was not what I wanted. Not worth returning"
2.0,Band started off great. After wearing it daily for 3 weeks it started coming apart.
2.0,Too small for a man to wear.
2.0,El tamaño es un detalle q tiene q ser escruto con claridad
2.0,"The jacket length at the sleeves are very short. I was told this was the &#34;style&#34; for the era. But it's a very uncomfortable style. If you zip it up and life your arms above your head, the sleeves will be halfway up your arms, and the jacket will be mid-stomach. If they would lengthen the sleeves and overall length of the jacket, it would be great. It cute and lightweight, but I had to send it back due to the fit."
2.0,low quality...see through.
2.0,"got lucky with this glass case. There was no reviews so i was hesitant to buy it but I thought, the price isn’t bad and if I didn’t like it, i can just return it. Luckily, this glass case was a perfect size, color was beautiful (my favorite shade of blue), leather isn’t stiff, it is soft and it’s a snap closure which i love. I wish there’s more other colors but it’s just blue. I will try to find a similar item in different color from a different seller, i just hope it’s the same quality.<br />02/24/2023 UPDATE — i took 3 stars out of my original 5-star rating. I used it for the first time 2 weeks ago on vacation. As i walk from the parking garage to the airport/check in, my reading glasses started to slip out of the case. Glad it didn’t fall out but half of it was hanging out of the case. I added a photo of how it looked like before i reached the check in counter. I never used it again during my vacation. Return window is already closed so i cannot return it 😔 .. i will try and use it for my sunglasses coz it’s a little thicker than my reading glasses, that might not slip, we’ll see."
2.0,"I got an XL because I wanted them to be baggy, they were baggy in the legs but fit strangely in the waste. The waist band was large (as expected) but the part right below the elastic of the waistband was extremely tight."
2.0,"The &#34;garment&#34; was too narrow across the top of the shoulder.  Unless you're wearing a quite narrow-necked sweater, there will be a gap between the edge of the half-shirt and the neck of the sweater as you move naturally during the day. It needs to be AT LEAST an inch longer on each side between the neck and what would normally be the top of the sleeve."
2.0,"Not a fan of the cheap material. Would have been better if it had a slit, because it's not flowy and difficult to walk in"
2.0,Junk. Too soft to be a good belt. Tossed
2.0,"This is not red, its peach colored. It went straight into the garbage."
2.0,I am a 10 -12 in size and bought and xl.  It was so tight and frumpy on me so sent back.  I do not like clothes made in china
2.0,I bought these thinking I was getting capris/crops and got pants. I'm 5'5&#34;/5'6&#34; and most stuff fits right where its supposed to but these were DEFINITELY pants. I kept them because they were comfy but I probably won't buy anything from this brand again for false advertising.
2.0,This dress is VERY small and SHORT. The material is is very cheap and see through. I wouldn't buy.
2.0,Cute but Very cheap.  Only lasted a week.  Very easy to bend.  No UV protection.
2.0,"I bought this bracelet for my daughter for Christmas. After approximately eight weeks of intermittent wear, this is what it looks like.  The bracelets tightening/loosening mechanism hasn’t worked for several weeks before it finally just broke today. She’s heartbroken. Lovely bracelet. Poor quality."
2.0,Disappointed. You get what you pay for.
2.0,"Unfortunately, I didn't get to use it because it just would not fit me. I am typically a Large (12-14) and I think that even the large size was basically suited for a small. Otherwise, it looks very beautiful."
2.0,"Good fit at first, however zipper broke within a week."
2.0,Everything looks pink
2.0,"I bought a large knowing I have bigger thighs, but the fit of the pants are very strange and the material is cheap.<br />Its quite tight in the leg area but very large in the waist, and the length of the pants are like capris. I had to do a lot of tailoring to make them work for my costume"
2.0,The pants for this Santa suit were super short. I mean not long enough to go to the boots.
2.0,"The shirt is not as oversized as it appears in the model photo. Order up multiple sizes for the same fit. The small fits like a medium regular sized T shirt (pink shirt). The colors are vibrant and the graphic is nice, although it as smaller as well."
2.0,Cheaply made my strap broke while I was on vacation. Was the second time wearing it. I had to throw it away. It is more of a pink color than a peach coral color
2.0,"I am pretty disappointed with some of the charms I received.These dieties were not animals. The charm faces are ridiculous. Any one can google pictures of Egyptian gods and clearly see that they were not animals and did not have animal faces.Nefertiti was beautiful and King Tut was handsome. I suggest creating new molds for the charms that have faces on them. I will never order from this seller againI really should have looked at the pictures of these deities before ordering them. I will use the other pieces for my project, but the 3 charms that represents some kind of animal god will be going in the trash."
2.0,"These seemed like perfectly good leggings - quality of fabric, style, cut, color, even proportion (they weren't way too long for an average sized human), but for the one issue of size. A size large was more like a child's large."
2.0,"The good:<br />The hat itself is a good quality item, the fleece insert is warm, the zippered section is clever and works well, and the stitching seems well done.  I have a large-ish head and it fits just fine.<br /><br />The not so good:<br />The speakers themselves are just okay.  They seem like a generic unit probably sold to a number of manufacturers of this sort of hat.  The sound is okay at best, passable, but certainly nothing special.  Battery life is atrocious.  I was afraid even with the claimed life, I'd need to charge them halfway through my eight hour shift at work, but they barely lasted 3.5 to 4 hours.  And of course they do not work while charging.<br /><br />The solution:<br />I didn't return the hat.  But I did remove the original speaker system and replace it with a mostly disassembled pair of Polk Audio UltraFit 2000 Headphones purchased on Woot for about 8 bucks.  The cable comes out the left side so I couldn't use the hole on the right for the usb, but they fit super-well in this hat, no charging required, vastly better sound, and still has a microphone for phone calls."
2.0,The color was not what the picture showed. Also it was a stretchy rubber band. I should have noticed before I bought.
2.0,Didn't have any links to make bigger.
2.0,"Cute bathing suit, good quality, very odd fit"
2.0,"Not really off the shoulder, not oversized. Just looks like a cheap striped sweater. The picture had me so hopeful too, darn it."
2.0,Too tight on the head---cannot sleep with this on the head.  Have no idea what I am going to do with it.
2.0,Super cute but super not sized correctly.
2.0,"I wore these earrins one time and a star fell off. They are very pretty but not durable, I was very disappointed, hopefully it was just a fluke thing with my pair and maybe no one else had this happen to theirs."
2.0,The dress is very thin and cheap. It hangs weird on the thigh area. I returned it.
2.0,It said it was a set and only came the bracelet. And the worst part that is was a gift for somebody.
2.0,It looks just like the picture but it's huge! There isn't an adjustable band. And the eyepatch itself falls an inch or more under my eyelid. So unless you have a huge face this probably won't fit.
2.0,Looks just like photos. Only issue? It's far too small in diameter to possibly wear as a septum ring.
2.0,Weird hard fabric.  Afraid it put in dryer as it likely will shrink
2.0,"Very nice, well fitting and light weight neck gaiter but after 2 months of use the stitching is coming apart.  for the fit, weight and stretch i give is 4-5 stars but overall given the seam came apart so quickly overall I would only give is 2 stars.  No way to contact the manufacturer."
2.0,"Like the description says, &#34; is the perfect gift for anyone like us at IFLScience who is crazy about the solar system!&#34;.  I'm crazy about nice jewelry for my wife, which is why I am disappointed in this piece.  I usually don't leave bad reviews unless I've been mislead.  The pictures of this item have all been photoshopped to blur-out the inside of the bracelet.  This piece is casted like a matchbox car, and the inside of the piece looks like the bottom of a cheap toy car.  I would not have purchased this item if I could have seen this in the photo."
2.0,"This seemed like a comfy sweater, but it was very thin and way too big.  I ordered a medium and it was just very wide and overall way too big.  Not sure if a small would have fit ok, it was just an odd shape so I sent it back."
2.0,"Love them! They come with a protective bag and a protective box to put them in when not wearing! Very sturdy and look just like the picture! I love them, and I didn't even have to pay $100 for them which is even better! Update: they gave me a headache because of the teint and a year later they broke.. the screw fell out. You get what you pay for."
2.0,"I wear a size 11 shoe and these were definitely hard to get on. They're warm and squishy, much thicker than expected - don't expect to wear these with shoes!<br /><br />I fear I won't be able to get them on my feet once I wash them, and that the sticky buttons on the bottom are going to just fall off."
2.0,Fits well but has a hole on the pocket. I returned it!
2.0,Loved this necklace at first but it broke on the 4th time I wore it. I was very disappointed. I'd order another but I'm afraid it'd break as well.
2.0,"Great concept, but it started messing up after about 4 tries. Would I recommend it? No."
2.0,Love the size of the jewel & love that you get multi colors in this pack. The problem is with the overall size of the post. I placed it in my nose and it immediately fell out & almost went down the drain. ;(. Very very small
2.0,"I purchased a 5T (which is the size my great-nephew wears comfortably) and the jeans were fitted like extremely skinny jeans. He hated them and refused to wear them because they were uncomfortable. He loved the top, but it, too, ran smaller than expected. I'm disappointed I wasted my money on this."
2.0,Washed and washed it’s still itchy
2.0,When you go to open it the umbrella is inside out and you have to fix it so that it is functional. Very cute and my daughter loves it but annoying.
2.0,It’s a lot shorter in person than in the picture.  The hem is straight and not as tuliped as the picture shows.  It’s also VERY crew neck not as much as a scoop neck as pictured
2.0,"LXS Womne Summer Dress Vest Skirt Sleeveless Chiffon Floral one-piece dress (L, 5)<br /><br />This dress is very small and short. I ordered size L and I can hardly fit into it. I usually wear size M (US) so I ordered up knowing this dress is made for the China market size. Still, ordered  size L is too short and too tight. I am 5.7 - 145 pounds.<br />Also - the material is see trough. I can see a very small person wearing this dress as a beach cover.  Colors are true to picture but the dress quality is just OK.<br />To return this dress you have to pay postage to return it to CHINA! Come on Amazon?!<br />I received this product at a discount to allow me to test it, and then write a review based on the results of my experience using this product. I am not affiliated with this company and I never promise to provide a positive review when offered a discount. I tested the product thoroughly so that you may make an informed decision. The views expressed are 100% my own honest opinion and are in no way influenced by the discount that I received."
2.0,"i had it for not even a minute before it broke in half. It doesn't fit on a normal person's ear (I even tried my eight year old sister's ear and it didn't fit her either), the cuff is very pretty but it would have been nice to wear it. Also its impossible to put it on unless you want your ear looking like a morphed elf's ear."
2.0,"First off I must admit these shorts fit me perfectly and I'm very pleased with them. I had to ding them 1* due to price. I paid $64.50 for the black/camo colored pair. This color is the only one priced so high. Other colors seem to vary in price from $38 up to $59. I don't feel like any board shorts are worth $65, but I sucked it up and bought them anyway because it's the color I really wanted. Other then price, my only negative comment would be that the carabiner with tiny flashlight are completely unnecessary imo. I mean, these are mostly intended to be swimming shorts...so why on earth do i need a flashlight or compass (last year model came w/carabiner and compass). Maybe ditch the uneccesary hardware and drop the price accordingly. Then I'd give these shorts 6 stars out of 5.<br /><br />**revised down to two stars. After 2nd washing the drawstring came out and is IMPOSSIBLE to re-thread back in. For the high price paid for these shorts, the drawstring should have been designed as such that it would not come through. Even if that means they come with knots already tied. At this point I'm frustrated with these shorts."
2.0,"Didn't fit very well, and the materials were NOT top class. I would not buy again."
2.0,Looked very cheap and like a toy
2.0,One of the smallest exlarge hats I have ever purchased. I have several ex large flex hats but  none that fit like this (very small).<br />Maybe I just received a mismarked hat or a knockoff !!  Pain in the --- to send back.
2.0,Broke quickly lasted a little bit tho
2.0,"Did not receive color ordered.  Fit was HORRIBLE!  Tried to give away, but noone wanted them!"
2.0,"Nice fit , cute style !<br />Just 1 problem that bugs me , why can’t they get the strips to match , how hard is that ?"
2.0,Very light weight. Thin. Pretty useless.
2.0,tarnished and blackened
2.0,"I like how the necklace looks.<br />However, when I went to put it on it left a brown/black sticky substance all over my hands, so I never wear it."
2.0,"I got this pair of sunglasses at a discount for an honest review.  But it’s not a good review…..<br />What I received I would expect to find in the Dollar Store, or maybe a prize from a gumball machine or a claw machine.  They are about as cheap as I’ve ever seen.  The “metal” frame around the lenses is extremely poor quality, rough finish, and not intentionally rough, just poor quality.  The whole frame is very thin and weak.  The arms seem a bit short.  I had to adjust mine quite a bit to get them to fit, and it’s not that I have a large head.  I know these are inexpensive sunglasses, but what I received is just plain cheap.  I like the bag though, that’s nice, and good quality too.  I’ll get some cheap but decent sunglasses and use the bag for those."
2.0,"Pictures are misleading. The split actually starts right at the collar, not lower like in the pictures so ALL of your back is exposed. Which is not what I was looking for. Other than that it would have been a great purchase as I like the basic idea but this shirt is just not for me."
2.0,Fraying after only 3 wears
2.0,"Nice colors, but a medium is a extra small"
2.0,I wish I would of read the reviews for this ring no love for me I could not see the word love it show it in black
2.0,"Very beautiful piece, however, mine came in 3 pieces. Once I glued it back together it worked amazing.<br /><br />Also slow delivery"
2.0,Don’t expect really nice.  It is rather cheap looking.
2.0,I am NOT going to trust my wallet on the end of this chain. Look at othethers.
2.0,Fits but not what I was expecting. Very thin and would melt if it got near a flame.
2.0,A bit large and totally see through.
2.0,was not impressed with the product. Was small and tight and not comfortable to work out in.
2.0,"Very cute bra, but that's all it's got going for it. I first ordered a C cup and when it was too big, I ordered a B cup. Unfortunately, both the C and B cups were THE EXACT SAME SIZE. I was so sure that the B cup would fit, I pulled the tags off of it and now I'm stuck with the thing. I tried to wear it anyway, but it is so extremely uncomfortable, I couldn't wait to take it off. I'm not understanding the positive reviews. Due to the fact that the B & C cups are literally the same size, I feel ripped off. Don't make the same mistakes that I did and avoid this bra from the start."
2.0,"good looking and comfortable belt. Leather is genuine.<br />But pay attention. This belt has the bleeding dye. For example, my jeans Wrangler is dyed after the first wearing of this belt. And if take into account that this jeans is light colour..."
2.0,From washing my hand the watch took on water and now every day when I put it on the glass dogs up on the inside.. Cheap watch
2.0,"So thin, almost shapeless because its such a thin, cheap piece of fabric. One seam is already splitting and it hasn't even been worn, yet.  Exactly what I've been conditioned to expect from Amazon's clothing options. The prices are usually good, but the product is just what you pay for.  My new year's resolution (the only one I've ever made!)  Won't buy clothing online anymore. It will be the only product I will discipline myself to go out and buy in person!"
2.0,"Yaaa!!! if I had known that they were not American made, I would have NEVER bought them... Definitely not professionally made, there were fray ends and colour was faded on some of the mask..."
2.0,"Way too hard to change bands. Totally not worth it. It is sitting on my desk, a waste of money. ."
2.0,Keeps breaking after 1 day!
2.0,Purchased for my husband as he was recovering from surgery. Definitely not a good quality at all of linen and seemed more like am XXL than an XL.
2.0,"Material is thick and kind of scratchy, it sucks to sweat while wearing this. Also, chest support is minimal."
2.0,I like this dress but it was a little short for me. I’m 5’4”.
2.0,I love gotg but these are just bad quality one broke off my backpack already and the others are bent and I just got them less than a week ago
2.0,The image is printed pretty large so it will be hard to get the desired prank effect. More of a novelty than a true illusion. Great quality fabric.
2.0,Larger than I expected or wanted
2.0,The bottom covered my belly button. It almost looked like a one piece because of that
2.0,"I LOVE Butterfly Twists and have 6 pairs.  However, the blue pleather on the heal started pealing after my 2nd time wearing them!"
2.0,"I was really expecting a dress and got a shirt instead. It's so short it fits right over my butt. I normally wear a large and mu chest has gotten very large since giving birth/nursing - but even if I ordered an XL, the length wouldn't change THAT drastically. I'll wear it as a shirt"
2.0,"IMPORTANT UPDATE:<br />The seller saw my review and issued a full refund along with a note saying they would like me to keep the item. They also stayed they would try to clarify the description. I'm very impressed.<br /><br />You can read my initial review below.<br /><br />INITIAL REVIEW:<br />This was a bit of a bummer. I thought I was ordering four 18mm rings. I got one 18mm ring. Also, it is very hard to manipulate, no easier than traditional rings.<br /><br />Too bad. I'm not going to send it back, because it's too much hassle for $8. It doesn't work for the purpose I had in mind. Hopefully, I'll find a use for it at some point."
2.0,"be warned, this piece is much larger than it appears. I bought it and the gift receiver was not even able to wear it because of its size and heaviness. the leather was very good quality but very thick for a piece that is to be worn on someone's neck. and the pendant is also good quality material but very large and very heavy. I would not suggest it unless it is being bought for a very largely built man who enjoys large jewelry pieces that could most likely bruise if it hits the wrong place. overall, the piece was well made and sturdy, but the size made it almost unwearable."
2.0,"I hate this bracelet. The colour silver is very dark, the links keeps twisting over showing the underside. But I guess for the price I should have know it was not a good buy."
2.0,It unglued from the corners
2.0,The quality wasn't as good as it appeared and the fit was way too small
2.0,Never fits right.
2.0,"Very very small, only fit my pinky finger just barely."
2.0,"Belt was good for a month, then the cheap coating came off and I'm walking around with a grey patch in the belt.  Would not recommend"
2.0,"These look great but the quality of the lace is not very good, they fit poorly."
2.0,Too heavy and bulky.
2.0,"I have several pairs of 90 Degree by Reflex leggings, both regular and capri length.  These are so tight and so uncomfortable, and they're the same size I normally order.  The material is thicker, and does not allow free movement like a yoga pant should.  Disappointed."
2.0,"I ordered two colors of this same product, specifically for the side split on the leg. The black pair does NOT have any side split (it’s sewn). The green camo did have the side split. Returned."
2.0,Way too big! Need an extra small for an option
2.0,This is not a 60mm more like a 52mm
2.0,Was very small for the normal size I got
2.0,"I was super excited for this piece, but the material was thinner and cheaper than expected. The fit was also super weird and uncomfortable.<br />One good thing was that it was a pretty decent length. I'm 5'10 and the bottom went right above my knees.<br /><br />Overall, underwhelmed by this product. Wouldn't recommend."
2.0,The necklace is very beautiful don't get me wrong but the packaged was tampered with and I was very disappointed. The necklace arrived broken it needs more secure package in which the necklace can not have free space to move.
2.0,"I first purchased these in the size 14 based on other reviewers saying they ran small.  They were giant.  I returned & purchased a size 12 & they fit around the waist, but had a big bulge in the crotch area so I returned those as well.  Just too much fabric there.  I'm a standard size 10.  Maybe someone with a different body type would like them better, not sure.  I think they are just poorly constructed.  I ordered the &#34;Flowery Ripped&#34; ones."
2.0,Way too long.. would fit a 7ft tall person
2.0,Looks like the time goes from wing to sing but it doesn't it attaches at the bank of the birds back. Gets caught in everything. Ok for the price
2.0,"The bathing suit was so disappointing. It was way to big up top, way too tight at the thigh. However, the ease for ordering and return made this sale much less painful!"
2.0,Over priced and loose fit.
2.0,They don’t block the Florida sun.
2.0,Not real silver. It change my finger green. And I wish I could bring it back but lost the ring.
2.0,It's too small over the shoulders. This is not a slim fit T shirt for athletic guys.
2.0,The shirt is cute and I plan to keep it but the yellow color is very much a very green color. It is not even a little bit yellow. Fit is good but disappointed in color
2.0,Its a great shirt. It says the extra large fits 12-14. Its more like a 14-16.
2.0,Not what subways looking for
2.0,"Very boxy, did not hang in a flowy way as portrayed. It was much larger than expected."
2.0,"As a one size for all, the fit is too large for me."
2.0,No paper work for a return.
2.0,I'm sure this can be debated 20 different ways but the fact is these cufflinks are curved in the wrong direction. In order for them to be worn properly and sit flat on the cuff the skulls end up sitting completely upside down. I don't know what they were thinking when they made these. Bad design and definitely getting sent back. Other than that they look nice.
2.0,Came dirty and didn't look brand new.
2.0,"I bought the large size,, I cant even get them over my calves, so I gave them away..."
2.0,"A bit on the cheap side but in the dark they are cute. My complaint I have against these are three colors are are almost the same, variations of salmon no pink as I really wanted."
2.0,Way way too big
2.0,"Once washed they really shrank - didn’t dry, hand washed and still shrunk in length a lot.  Probably a good 3 inches.  Sad, they were nice pants before that!"
2.0,"These pants fit well around the waist, however they are a bit too short."
2.0,"Bad material, it was smaller than expected. Do not recommend it. Might be good for a costume  accessory."
2.0,Cute dainty ring…..can’t be real sterling silver has already tarnished…I own a lot of sterling silver jewelry and none of it has ever turned colors.
2.0,I ordered 3 bags for Christmas Gifts for my Grand daughters. Nice bags but one of them came with the inside lining ripped all along the zipper. They should check the bags before they are sent out.
2.0,Made well with good tough fabric. But they fit like skinny jeans. I'm a 40 waist and they barely button and never mind moving around and working.
2.0,"Super comfortable, but after only 7 hours of wear, there were 2 holes in the crotch area.  Will not purchase again."
2.0,Would not stay inflated very long.
2.0,Walmart quality
2.0,Too thin and delicate. Broke after wearing only three days. Better to order a wider width chain.
2.0,I can't find a place to plug them into the tens unit.  I thought you could do that.  They are uncomfortable to stand on and they came with absolutely no instructions.  Very disappointed.
2.0,"One was perfect, but one was completely broken in multiple places and it took a month to come in."
2.0,This bag looks cute but has no bottom. No bottom makes it narrow. Don't be fooled by the buttons and straps it doesn't expand.
2.0,I usually wear a 2X (I'm 5'7 & 210 lbs.) It was super tight in the breast area and arms. Neck hole was small too.  These sizes are WAY OFF. Size up.
2.0,Nice ring but they don't show you it's split on The Underneath looks like a toe ring
2.0,"Not that the sweatpants were bad, it's more the fact that I do not like tight ""skinny"" style pants at all! I was happy when I found these then became very disappointed after receiving them to find out how tight in the legs they were. I wish I could find another pair of baggy style sweats but it seems fashion trends know very little about what some people actually can stand and/or like. Wish they or someone made both style of pants as I refuse to wear skinny style pants. I firmly believe those kind of pants are for women.<br /><br />Please note they did fit in the waist and length."
2.0,"I thought I was buying sweatpants as they are advertising a jogging pants.  These are more like hipster trousers.  Very thin on the calf, and if you do any jogging in these, there is chaffing and some circulation issues.  These are more fashion and less exercise accessory."
2.0,"It looks ok, but it does not have instructions to remove extra links and it does not use standard tools to remove the pins. Need to take to a jewler to adjust?"
2.0,Had to give my shirt to my wife.  The large was closer to a small
2.0,"The ring is cute,  however you should probably order a half size up."
2.0,Cute but easily broke.
2.0,"I'm occasionally on the lookout for the best and most accurate wristwatch I can buy. I became aware of this Tissot because it's apparently the most affordable 'certified chronometer' watch currently available. For months I had it on my wish list, and after much debating, I finally ordered it. I have gifted a very nice Tissot in the past, so I felt this should be a solid purchase.<br /><br />The watch was fairly nice, although not the highest standard of details and materials. It wasn't stunning right out of the box. It didn't have a lot of weight to it. The crystal seemed ordinary. It felt right around what a $100 watch ought to be.<br /><br />It wasn't long before I found a problem--the second hand did not line up with the second markers. I watched the second hand all the way around the dial and it never lined up properly--it was always about 30% past the markers. As a matter of fact, zoom in and take a close look at the image of the watch on this listing--does that look to you like the second hand lines up with the second marker? No, it doesn't. It's off by a third of a second, just like the one I received.<br /><br />For a watch billed as a 'certified chronometer,' that is unacceptable. In fact, I would find that unacceptable in just about any watch, even a $30 Timex.<br /><br />I took it to my local watch repair shop, and was told it could be fixed, but that it was better if I exchanged it, returned it, or had it fixed under warranty.<br /><br />Maybe a certified Tissot shop could have helped me with a warranty repair, but after that short time I wanted nothing else to do with it. If I'm going to buy a 'certified chronometer,' I want the second hand striking right on the markers, as it should, straight from the factory.<br /><br />I sent it back. Luckily the return was not a problem."
2.0,Would have been better if there was a 23 on the back
2.0,Not as big as I thought. Strap feels like a seat belt.  I bought it for school but I can't even for a 3 ring binder in it. Design on the bag is nice though...
2.0,Came messy with fuz and threads of different color all over it and it smelt horrible..<br />I guess once its washed it should be fine...
2.0,"Got an xl and it was shockingly big on me. Lace looks cheaper than the picture. I was expecting a softer, more elegant lace like in the picture. Dress is too long for my taste. The waist needs to be tighter and the back is too wide causing it to fall down where the zipper stops up top.  Dress looks better in the darker colors. May order a smaller size or return it. I'm nervous if i get a smaller size my arms wont fit."
2.0,it was way to small and next to O down
2.0,Looked a bit cheap (think: Halloween costume) and it was way too shiny.  I bought this dress this hoping to wear it to a holiday party.  My daughter walked by just as I was opening the package and asked &#34;Is that a vampire dress!?&#34;  Promptly boxed it up and returned...
2.0,I was expecting it to be a much darker green. It is more of a neon green. Still cute but not what I wanted.
2.0,I have to return it..too big for my feet..but it really looks good and comfy.
2.0,My chain broke very easily.
2.0,I gave these only 2 stars because they are so short.  They are more like a capri.  Other than that they are ute and comfortable and I will wear them this summer.
2.0,"They are slippery like silk, but they are polyester which I thought would not be so thin and slippery."
2.0,This watch didn’t even last a year!!
2.0,"What I received was not what is pictured. The item I received was not a halter vest, had a full back and was essentially just a sleeveless vest. It also only had one button immediately under the bust."
2.0,"Only received 5 pairs of socks, should have been 6 pairs."
2.0,The earrings are sized for young child. It’s not about preference they’re literally too small to fit around a grown woman‘s earlobe. The gemstone is barely noticeable more of a speck than a stone. Definitely returning.
2.0,Really thin. Only patterened on one side. Not great at keeping me warm. Rate them meh. Next time will pay extra $ and get merino wool
2.0,"As others have said, the pin is very weak and has bent when trying to force the peg through the hole because the holes are not cut big enough for it to fit through without force. The leather is good, but mine came with some blemishes on the finish. I will keep the straps and purchase another closure system with a smaller peg.<br /><br />I'm glad it was only $15."
2.0,"I’m 5’2 and the hem is above my ankle. The material almost feel like a heavy work pant. The wAist is very basic elastic with lots of natural pleating because there’s so much material. The way it lays is so unflattering I couldn’t imagine what top could help that. Returning, sad because it looked so cute in pictures"
2.0,"The ring is cute and worked well as a graduation gift to a fun kid. However, the ring is dark not bright silver like the photo shows. So it's hard to read the words, much less the one inside. :("
2.0,I bought the orange and blue.  I love the orange shorts the material is soft but the blue not so much.  They look and feel like cheap scrubs that have been cut off into shorts.
2.0,Rhinestones were missing
2.0,I bought this same dress 2 years  ago.  The original better made.  Very disappointed in the new one.
2.0,post fell off after only one use
2.0,"I like the color and style.  It has a drawstring inside to tighten it if too large.  Problem........ It came in a plastic shipping bag, was totally flattened out, I can't get the very noticeable dents in both sides and brim out no matter what I do to get them out.  It's like the black ribbon is too tight and with it being flat as a pancake when it arrived, that didn't help either"
2.0,"The borders and seems don’t line up. The graphic that’s on it, isn’t even lined up at all either so it looks a little wonkey or off.  I ordered a medium, I’m 160, 5’8. And this is tight.  I will try it out for a day. But will more than likely, return unfortunately."
2.0,Skirt too long and discolored.
2.0,"Plastic adjustable slides, not metal like described. Hat is nice. Apron is cheap, thin."
2.0,"They are cute shoes, but they did not match.  The toe stitching on one does not align with the toe stitching on the other shoe. One shoe also seemed to fit smaller. I returned them."
2.0,Reeeeeally nice - but broke within three weeks with light use. Ended up having to return.
2.0,"I like it, so cute. It is a little bit thinner than I was expecting..... update: 1 day later. 3 of the stones have fallen out☹️. Not so cute anymore."
2.0,I'm 5' 7 and this dress is SO long.  Super pretty but had to return to do length.
2.0,Nooooooot supportive. Cute for lounging around in. But would never wear out and about
2.0,"*sigh. Why are most dresses see through these days? I've been trying to find a new dress that doesn't show every line of underwear as well as what color they are. So disappointing. Not everyone wants to show off their bra and underpants. If you don't buy into the current fashion trend trying to convince you that underwear is suddenly acceptable for public viewing, I recommend you try elsewhere."
2.0,Looks good.  Started turning my wrist black after 6 months.
2.0,I bought this only because of the reviews saying it’s soft. It’s sandpaper soft
2.0,Runs small.  Shorter than it appears on model.
2.0,Underwear rolled down while wearing
2.0,Just didn’t feel comfortable around my waist…
2.0,I received 3 sprayers and 1 did not spray from the start
2.0,"I have no idea what prompted my five year old to desire a cat pocket watch, but of course I was able to find one on Amazon.  However, the back cover broke off on the very first day."
2.0,I love the look of these for my daughter but they have a strange fit.
2.0,"I read the reviews before I ordered and decided to try it out.  It is pretty BUT THAT IS NOT WHY I BOUGHT IT FOR - can only hang hoop earrings, pendants ? no place for it, rings ? yes but it's hard to find what you want to wear as it hsngs down, sorry, total disappointment."
2.0,"Purchased these for my husband for Christmas, they did NOT come with the removalable padding. Very disappointed"
2.0,"Bag it came in is burnt, and The keychain is BROKEN.. I can’t give this as a gift."
2.0,I ordered a large which is my usual size but it was too small.  i am 5'6 and 165 pounds.  It was also way too short.
2.0,"I wanted to love this dress since I love the shirt version but it just didn’t work out. It was too big, giving me no shape at all. Also the bottom was see through and it was a little short so it wasn’t appropriate for work or a professional event. The material also seemed very thin. Sadly I had to return."
2.0,Started to unravel after the first wash.
2.0,one I received had only 8 windows not 10 as advertised. have to eliminate some things in my wallet.
2.0,Not so sure about these. Super thin.... they fit well but super thin. My leg hair sticks through them....
2.0,"It is difficult to set the time on this watch.  While you are setting it, it jumps forward several minutes at a time, so that it is impossible to set it to the correct time.  I'm not using it.  I would not recommend it to a friend.  I'm reminded that you get what you pay for."
2.0,"I ordered a size large in women’s wanting to have a shirt that’s slightly bigger (I usually wear a medium). I’m small chested and couldn’t even button it up! Not sure if this was incorrect sizing or what, but I’m returning. Loved the color and style, just not the fit."
2.0,This watch is a huge clunky Beast.wore it week ended up with a large bruise on my wrist where it banged me.
2.0,I loved the colors and fit but the quality was poor.  The seams were not sewn correctly and were split in two different areas on the sleeve.
2.0,Way too small for an average Ear.  It brakes if you  if trying to fit it to the ear.
2.0,The toes fit really weird on these and were very uncomfortable. I had to take them off 2 minutes after putting them on. My adult kids thought the same thing. Very sad as I really wanted these.
2.0,"I love to wear sun shirts.  Once you have had skin cancer, you are more circumspect about doing this.  I loved the colors but the body was too big and the sleeves a bit on the narrow side...not a comfortable fit for an active lifestyle."
2.0,Gave this product 2 stars only because its cute.  My suggestion? Hang dry. 2 sizes smaller after I washed and dried it and only got to wear it once du we to this.  Had to give it away after it shrunk.
2.0,"I've bought a lot of clothing from this seller and more often than not, I'm really pleased. However, I did not like this shirt AT ALL! Usually their shirts are made from a more cotton-like material. I have no idea what this was made out of but it looks and feels extremely cheap. I'm sorry to leave a bad review but this shirt was not as well made as some of the others from this seller."
2.0,not near the quality I thought a small item though would be thicker cloth
2.0,There was a very loud sound that emitted when you turned the mask on
2.0,It was suppose to come with a free eye mask. GOT NO MASK
2.0,"It was a good idea, for a dog tag. But the writing is so small even with my glasses on I couldn’t read it. But the sentiment was there I definitely would not buy it again."
2.0,Turned color and didn’t hold up. Beautiful when bought.
2.0,I give it two stars as its big for me and its a bit annoying to hear the key lock pendant hitting up against it. Its light weight. Its ok just two big for me and it doesn't adjust.
2.0,would not stay up
2.0,I bought light tan and it was VERY pale pink.  The fit is also awkward and boxy/falls off the shoulders. Would look better if it were more structured.
2.0,"The size runs small. I thought if I adjusted it to fit,  I'd  She-Hulk out of it."
2.0,"Compared to iColor sun caps, this is far inferior in comfort and fabric.<br />IColor face and neck scarfs lay flat, while this stays crinkled because it is cheap plastic feeling fabric. The headband in cap is not easy to adjust, and it is scratchy and pokes into forehead because it also is not a smooth pliable fabric.<br />Just trying it on was uncomfortable, went right back in package to return."
2.0,Not like the picture. Very small hoops. Pretty but not as described
2.0,Not what l would say  is my cup of tea
2.0,"These are cute, but they were too heavy to wear. I sent them back."
2.0,I have a fairly short waistline. These were too high for me.
2.0,We did not receive the Lightning McQueen and Mater socks that were displayed when purchasing.
2.0,"The dress fit OK, but the waist is very high.  Seems like it’s made for people with VERY short torsos."
2.0,Too wide at the neck
2.0,Too short... returning
2.0,"Originally I thought this bag was great for the price, but the zipper just busted and it’s only 10 days past the expiration of the return date."
2.0,All of the reviews were dead on! I went two sizes up and I felt as ify breasts were exploding out of it!
2.0,Definitely not an authentic jersey.  Poor quality!
2.0,Love the feel and look but it runs small
2.0,"I got this for my wife, and she reports that, while this is usable and she keeps it as a backup, it's not her first choice due to a couple factors. First, the material feels cheaply made. Second, there's a mesh material in the bra area that's uncomfortable. The pattern is pretty and the sizing is accurate, but since the comfort is not good, this is not recommended."
2.0,Color said apricot but it was beige.  Not a hint of an apricot color.
2.0,The stretchers themselves are ok. When it read “set of 2” I guess I thought 4 total. Have to have 2 for a  Pair of pants. A little misleading
2.0,"Did not get the right colors. I got two different sized tapers, one big and one small, but I prefer the small one. The fake plus were definitely orange and not red."
2.0,Legs roll up. And I bought one size larger than usual to avoid this.
2.0,"The mask had a big white spot on the right eyelid. would have return it but didn't want to pay for a box to return it a UPS, couldn't return it at Khol's oh well I'll just put it high so I don't have to see the white spot"
2.0,My mom and I both wore a pair for a wedding.  Within a few minutes the heels from our shoes sunk through the heel protectors and we were sinking into the ground.  Great concept.  Would be better if the bottoms were metal.
2.0,The type of masks that have thin straps. The throw-away kind. My reusable washable masks however have too thick of straps and these things don't catch them very well. I suppose that's more of a me-problem than a fault of the product.
2.0,I bought and extra large cuz I read some the reviews saying it ran small. So not true. What really annoyed me though was one of the straps in the back is twisted so it never lays flat.
2.0,Beautiful dress...runs small
2.0,My husband is 6 feet tall and 205 pounds. He ordered the medium and the pants barely came to his ankles. The waist even looked too tiny. Definitely size up! Other than that the pants looked ok if they would have fit.
2.0,Giraffe fell off shortly after my mom put it on :(  Very disappointing.
2.0,such cute earrings but did not last long at all which was so sad :-( they are very discolored and kind of gross looking now. haven't found another pair like these yet.
2.0,The buckle scratched after first use and the belt has a terrible odor.
2.0,"Jewelry came on time, however this looked very cheap. I expected it to look inexpensive, but not like toy jewelry. The chain was plastic material like a toy necklace. Not for me. I quickly returned this item and I was given a full refund."
2.0,"I bought one pair of yellow sandals from this seller. I absolutely loved them, they were so comfy I could walk in them all day! I ordered three more pairs in different colors. It’s important to note, I don’t really wear these sandals super often. I went to put on my black pair the other day and the strap was completely broken, making the sandal unwearable. I had only worn this particular pair maybe two or three times. The other pairs seem to be holding up fine, but having the strap come apart on this pair make me nervous about wearing any of the others—what if they break when I’m out around town and can’t easily get home to change? It’s a shame because they are SUPER comfy, but just not very well-made I guess. Will not buy again."
2.0,I did not get the waist belt to tie it
2.0,"Update: the leggings now have small holes in them after only a few months of light wear. Don’t waste your money.<br /><br />I loved the maternity version of these leggings so I decided to buy these in hopes that they were the same. They are not. They’re very soft, but the material is thinner than the maternity leggings. The pockets are VERY long. I can fit my arm all the way up to the elbow in them! There’s no reason for the pockets to be so long. And then since the fabric is thinner & not compressive, the waist band starts sliding down from the weight of anything in the pocket."
2.0,Looks pretty just wish it would have come before Christmas.... disappointed I have to give this to my mom after the holidays....
2.0,The bottoms fit perfect but even my small boobs kept falling out. Everyone got a view of my nips. I mean if I were just to lay out in the sun the swim suit is perfect but if you wanted to swim and function then....enjoy my boobs....
2.0,"Super cute hat, great concept, but one of the two light settings is literally a white strobe light effect.  I have concerns that this may not be tested for epilepsy results since I’m sure it’s not intended for wearing for long periods with others nearby consistently but my kids will wear these constantly and with one of our two hats not charging from the box and the other being this extreme in brightness and flashing I need to return it.  Just wasn’t a good fit for what I had thought it’d be."
2.0,There is no indication from front or back
2.0,Bad quality and it came stained. Someone else used it.
2.0,"Was disappointed in the quality. For being 14K gold, the posts were not straight and the earring backs are cheap and fall off the posts. Next time I will go for quality and pay more."
2.0,Mabe hats are best bought in person
2.0,"Too small overall and too short in length.  Fabric is not standard cotton looking, but synthetic type.  I am 5’8” about 160 and ordered ‘L’."
2.0,Extremely strong smell that does not improve. Had to get it out of the house after a couple of weeks.
2.0,"Lied!! about the PRODUCT DETAILS<br /><br />Fabric Type<br />96% Cotton, 4% Elastane<br />Actually 96% Viscose not cotton!!"
2.0,it fits small and the fabric looks very cheap
2.0,"It's great quality but unhappy with length it says 18"" for men or woman not children it is very short"
2.0,"It tore to easy, hard to slide packs in and out, maybe i should have gotten two sizes bigger but I'm a 2x. It was too short and a bit tight."
2.0,The description says dress...it was only a shirt.  Misleading
2.0,Poor quality! Product already coming apart.
2.0,"only for night driving, cheap materials"
2.0,ZERO SUPPORT- WISH I HAD RETURNED IT BEFORE- probably too late. Do not recommend.
2.0,Material was thin and shorts would ride up while sleeping. Very uncomfortable. A pair with a little more weight would not get all bunched up at night.
2.0,They would fit someone very small. These were not as advertised
2.0,"The fabric of this dress is extremely thin. It felt almost see through. I ordered a size S since I’m 5’2 115lbs. It fit good, except the sleeves. Those were huge on me."
2.0,"At first it fit perfectly well, then after one wash in Delicate mode and air dried the bottom part turned loose! Not buying this again."
2.0,Neck of shirt fit however!!!! The rest of the shirt was huge.  I ended up having to take up the entire shirt. 4 stars however for the tie & cummerbund and the quality of the material of the shirt.
2.0,"It came with a very obvious flow on the 2nd and 3rd layer of metal. It had a fabrication stain and scratch and since it was too much trouble to return it, I considered as a loss. Anyways it looks pretty, but I do not like the fact that whoever packs them, don't care for the customer who paid, and they send them defect sometimes."
2.0,"I was expecting to receive something with a little more quality with the price I paid! I I'm scared it will fall apart even if I hand wash it delicately. I'm just hoping it will last for a few hours. Over priced, in my opinion"
2.0,"This swimsuit is not what I expected. The fit is good but the color  and pattern look generic. It looks nothing like what the model is wearing. It looks like the last picture but worse. I will not be wearing this in public, only my own private home pool. Maybe..."
2.0,"Really low waste, returned. They were awkward."
2.0,"I ordered 2 of these in different sizes hoping one would work. They both technically fit, but neither fit well. Maybe I should have gone up another size. However, the material wasn’t what I expected either. The inside of the shirt was a slick satiny material. It felt cool against my skin. For a long sleeve shirt for cold weather, that’s not the feel I was going for."
2.0,"These were a big disappointment. They just don’t hold much.<br /><br />I lived in Amsterdam about 20 years ago. Net shopping bags were common there. And they held so much much more. They hold 2 or 3 times what these bags hold.<br /><br />The quality was fine, the stitching was good. The only problem I have with them is the size. They aren’t very useful for grocery shopping."
2.0,Beautiful dress but return is to China and cost of return exceeds cost of the dress
2.0,"These NIcool Printed Socks look cool … until you put them on. I wear a size 7.5 in men shoes, so I’m actually smaller than the size range, which is a men’s 9-13.<br /><br />The printing stretches out on my calves so that the pale inside of the sock shows through. This is very noticeable, especially on the black socks.<br /><br />I wouldn’t wear these for any athletic activity -- they aren’t hiking socks, in my opinion. More of a novelty sock. The card on the inside of the bag says the socks are made from 48% polyester, 13% spandex, 15% elastic, and 24% nylon. But the product description says 55% polyester, 15% spandex, 21% elastic, and 9% cotton. Which to believe?<br /><br />I can’t say for sure, but I don’t think there’s any natural material in the socks. My feet started sweating practically as soon as I put them on, and I wasn’t doing anything strenuous."
2.0,One of the plates was broken when I received it
2.0,"Perhaps if I were taller this dress might have looked nicer, but for me it just all bunched up and looked very frumpy. I was very disappointed, as I wanted something fun."
2.0,Was way to big and fabric was not as expected. Probably won’t ever be able to wear
2.0,"I purchased these socks to add to care packages for the homeless/less fortunate. I was disappointed to see how extremely thin and cheap quality they are. Wasn't expecting the highest quality, but these are barely thicker than nylon stockings/tights. I'm guessing they'll have holes in them within two or three days. Super disappointed."
2.0,Some of the earrings broke easily and some of them changed colors.  Tarnished easy.
2.0,"This product is very cheaply made. The fabric is thin but very soft. It shed everywhere when I opened it and stock to my clothes, it is so bad that I just think this is gonna get worst when I'll wash it. You can see the finition is real bad too, threads coming out of every seam. It's big, I am normaly a large and the medium (which is for my stepdaughter) fits me. I guess the only thing I like about it is the pattern. I don't recommend buying it."
2.0,The bracelets fell apart after wearing them for a couple of days!!!!!!
2.0,Just got it and loved it but the fake leather is peeling off and I was looking forward to buying all my friends one for Christmas'
2.0,Fabric is very poor
2.0,"I bought this product 6 months ago and they were great. I went to make another purchase and they completely changed the material, not only did they not fit, the material wasnt light weight and stretchy like most work out material. I would not recommend using these for fitness -  they'll rip in a heart beat."
2.0,"I bought this for my Granddaughter. It does not look like it does on Amazon! I couldn't even see the stone!!! The only reason I am not sending it back is because my sweet little Granddaughter loves it !because it was a gift  from Grandpa and Grandma! O well, just becareful."
2.0,I received this purse today.  Ordered it yesterday!!  It is so pretty and I really like the compartments and the space.  BUT as I was switching my stuff from my old purse to this one I noticed that the small inside zipper is broken and won't zip.  I am so disappointed.  I hate going through return processes so I guess I will just deal with it.
2.0,I am disappointed.  I ordered these for my granddaughters and got thr wrong size.  The packaging says they are large  but the tag on the bonnet say medium. Not happy at all.
2.0,"This was an absolutely horrific bathing suit experience. At first glance, the stitching already looked like it was ready to go at any moment. The top runs EXTREMELY small, however the bottoms weren't bad. My 36DD's practically laughed at the flimsy top. If you have any curves, there is no way to stop this suit from looking overly provocative... if you can even get into the thing. I still love the shape of the bikini and I was able to find one by Esther Williams that I absolutely adore and received endless compliments on. Great idea, but poor execution. I'll pass."
2.0,Good deal but tarnished fast.
2.0,Too small and the buckle holes were not open. Cheap.
2.0,"Fabric is scratchy and the pants are too short! Very disappointed...bought another set from a different company...I kept them because I washed them, which is when they shrunk worse in length!"
2.0,items bottom is very sheer and see threw... Also fit is awkward. And came with a tear at the bottom. Do not suggest.
2.0,"I ordered 4 of these dresses in different colors. The color in this one is really pretty, but it’s a little short for my taste in maxi dress. I’m 5’6 165lbs and all on the other dresses were on the floor with length. But for whatever reason, this one fell to the tops of my ankles? Not cute. So had to send it back. Hard to tell which color is gonna be “short” for a maxi"
2.0,These bras were very stiff. The material was not comfortable.
2.0,"Pretty, but broke after 2 wears. Wouldn’t buy again."
2.0,The navy blue looks nothing like the picture. I bought these to match my work uniform but they look more like a grayish purple
2.0,The glass decanter is nice and decorative. But the spout does not pour. It more or less drips very slowly. The hole is too thin for honey or syrup. I ended up taking off the lid and pour out the honey. I gave two stars for the glass. I do not recommend this product.
2.0,Material is not that good...but looks beautifull
2.0,Poor shirt quality.  Scratchy material.
2.0,"The black and blue were ok, but the others appear gaudy."
2.0,Standing up the dress fit fine the minute I sat down it riped. Really disappointing. The dress was not made properly bc it shouldn't have riped. I order a size L I measured myself according to the size chart.
2.0,Too short and ccx the tips too raggy looking
2.0,"The watch is cool and nice, batteries are not made for the energy it requires though. Also, it doesnt work with Android."
2.0,"Upon opening the package, there are streaks and marks all over the scarves, as well as fraying around some seam edges.  I haven’t attempted to wash yet, but for the price I expected higher quality control."
2.0,"5 stars for being very WARM in Seattle’s 40 degree weather. Minus -1 star for being bigger than expected, it’s not even a “one size fits all”. The “buckle” strap isn’t what is pictured, minus -1 star. Mine came with Velcro strap instead & unable to secure it in the up position,... another -1 star."
2.0,Keeps you warm. Funny smell.wash first
2.0,"I really liked this bag at first. Now it's falling apart, conveniently 3 days after the return policy is up. The threads for the strap completely broke and now i can't even use it. I walk to the train station from my car, commute, and walk 3 blocks to work in NYC. So it's not like I have it on at all times, less than half an hour a day, maybe. I don't carry anything extremely heavy in the bag, just a few items I like to have with me on my commute. This happened a day after carrying an Apple Macbook Air (which weights 3 lbs) to and from work.<br />It hasn't seen much heavy usage but it is now completely useless. I would prefer a replacement or refund, but it seems I'm SOL and stuck &#34;holding the bag&#34; as it were. Truly upset with Amazon and the AB Earth for such a shoddy and shady sale.<br /><br />Proof is attached. Purchased Dec 30. Didn't start using it till Jan 5th when my job opened again. So it didn't even last a month."
2.0,Got the job done. Once you got past the disgusting and nauseating smell of chemicals
2.0,Look is nice toughness is great but the lens are hard to line up what you are looking for(small window to see clear a little movement and it's blurry
2.0,Requested 2 rose earring set and received 1 rose set  and received a different set of earning which I did not ordered. Both sets earring were found broken meaning the flowers and other earrings were off the base and I had to use superglue to sick it to wear it. Really not happy. Might be I received the damaged sets.
2.0,You need To small head and face otherwise this won't fit. It takes so much adjusting and it hurts x.x looks cool once it's in but oi
2.0,Product was way too small. It really was a large not extra extra large.  When describing the product it could have read that the size is European size not US.  Will be returning the product.
2.0,"The tie itself was attractive. But the quality of the tie itself was lacking. I should have known, obviously you get what you pay for. It would be a great item for someone who doesn't care about the quality of fabric etc."
2.0,I’m a medium (6-8) in most items sometimes a large if it’s on hips. I have a small waist medium bust and decent hips.  I could in no way button this jot even close.  Reordering a 12-14 and hoping since it’s such a cute dress.
2.0,I ordered these on their size claim. I couldn't even put my heel in it and they were so narrow  all I got  was pain
2.0,This is sold as a Man's watch.  Only purchase it if you have a really small wrist.  My wrists aren't large but this is a baby watch.
2.0,I never even got as far as trying this dress on. The material is cheap and the ruching looks like a maternity dress. Save your dollars. Sent it back.
2.0,"This a very sturdy trainer a bit bulky though and if you pull bands to tight it sits up,not in love."
2.0,Didn’t lay on my right. Looks great on model but I’m a tall and curvy girl that couldn’t pull this off
2.0,The shirt fit is too loose in the torso and it is way to tight in the shoulders. I am constantly adjusting how it hangs. Normally I have no issues with T-shirts
2.0,"[[VIDEOID:b081fceb3599209357b50b39944b67c]] I lose lost of weight so wanted to use it on my dresses but it doesn't stay in place. I place and put the dress on. Seems fine but the moment I walk or sit or move it pop out and unplug,  so doesn't stay in place. Maybe I put it in the wrong place,  because I put it in the back of my dress not in the side."
2.0,Very cute but VERY short!
2.0,"I have a pair of Croc flaps that are super comfortable and I bought 3 years ago. I have been on vacation with them several times, pretty much wear them every day in the summer and they are still going strong. I've had these just over a month and they broke. I am past my time to return or exchange, so that's unfortunate. I don't know if it was just this batch that was less-than-sturdy, but I'm very disappointed and will attempt to go into the stores to purchase things like this from now on so I can present a case and not click around to no avail."
2.0,Very disappointed.  The beads were not all the same color.  Some were an expected bright white and others were more cream.
2.0,Didn't last long.  Holes developed.  I would suggest spending a bit more and getting better quality.
2.0,I'm 5'3&#34; and 150 lbs and I ordered a large. The lace parts sagged down around the shoulders and the inner layer didn't keep in place since it's not really sewn to the lace... The elastic band in the waist is not flattering. I don't really think a medium would work for me either. Overall the dress was poorly constructed. I returned it.
2.0,This shirt fit smaller than expected. And it was also a little short on me. I ordered a 2xl which usually fits baggy on me and this was pretty tight. I was able to gift it to a friend who is smaller and shorter than me.
2.0,Not flexible at all.  Hopefully they will &#34;break-in&#34; eventually and I will enjoy wearing. I do like the height they lend but they just feel awkward.
2.0,Kinda disappointed. It looks more orange then red.
2.0,Beautiful bronze pearls one earring did not have the hook
2.0,Top is smaller than I thought. Shorts fit fine but pockets are poorly made.
2.0,Material was wayyyy too thin. You can see through them.
2.0,Only whore it a couple of times and then after warranty period fortuna out hour hand does not stay put.  It is loose and does not stay where it is supposed to.  I would love to return it and get a new one.
2.0,The fit overall was fine but the chest area did not match the overall fit. Had to return due to actual buttons and larger bust.
2.0,Arrived damaged with threading falling off and discoloration. It fits cute but it very low quality.
2.0,Like spandex material. Wouldn’t recommend
2.0,Se siente un grado de aumento en la visión
2.0,It was way to small for my arm I ended up letting my girlfriend have it. And thats that I dont have to big of an arm.
2.0,"Cute blouse, but it must be for people with a short tors It runs really small."
2.0,"This was a really cute style top and comfortable, but it was totally sheer. My daughter needed to wear another shirt under it."
2.0,The top and shorts are NOT proportional.  Love the top had to give the shorts to my niece.
2.0,Falls off your bike pretty easily
2.0,"not quite as puctured. the toe is actually flat, not raised; more sock-slipper type. was looking for slipper-shoe tupe."
2.0,"Pretty print but fabric is heavy, expected it to be lighter.  The flare of shirt was not flattering on me.  I think if fabric was lighter it would not of flared it would be more of a flow (maybe).<br /><br />I did order a size larger due to other reviews, that it ran small, so fit was okay because of this."
2.0,"my son ordered this. he got his lip pierced on his birthday. Im not crazy about it, so I have nothing to say! Except it took forever to get here"
2.0,I wear a 9 E to 9.5 E these 44 M were too narrow. If the shoe was a 45 M Wide I would have given 5 stars. Sizing needs to be explained for USA Market.
2.0,I liked this dress alot of but it didn't fit well in the waist. It was too large and belting it wasn't an option since the waist starts high on this dress. I had to return it unfortunately.
2.0,"This watch band looks nice and felt like it was constructed well.  However, after 30 days of wear it ripped down the seam where the pin attaches the band to the watch.  These bands will be okay for a fashion watch, but are not suitable for an everyday watch worn in moderate to heavy work situations."
2.0,"I returned it.thin nylon, stretchy material.<br />Misleading.  I thought it was a pretty was waffle top. Personally it's not for me."
2.0,Sweatshirt was about a size and a half smaller than sizing.
2.0,It does not let you breath easy because it’s thicker than some others so you have resistance when you breath in. When I bought this I bought another brand too. With the other brand you don’t even know it’s covering your face or nose and mouth. The other is YORC UPF 50+ UV Protection Face Mask.<br />I have zero financial interest in this review or any Amazon products.<br />Just ordered more of the other ones. I soaked the Yorc one with water and squeezed it out and it was super comfortable and cooling for 1/2 hour. After 1/2 hour it still helps by reflecting the hot sun and evaporates your sweat.
2.0,"I've purchased other brands that fit better.  This one had a weird shape and puckered in weird places -- didn't fit well at all. Ultimately I got it to work for my needs, but when the sticky goes, I will be looking elsewhere for a replacement."
2.0,Bought at a local jewellery store. LOST it after 1 year (it fell off my wrist). I loved it so much I came to repurchase. It's beautiful. But the price isn't worth the unreliable clasp.
2.0,"pretty and comfortable enough, but the colors on them faded to black and white after wearing them for less than a week"
2.0,Runs large and is rather long for someone who is short like myself
2.0,"This shirt is not what I expected. The shape is boxy, the fabric is stiffer than I thought it would be and holds wrinkles, and, although I usually wear size medium in shirts, this medium was too large. (I'm 5'5"" tall and weigh 140.) The only thing I really liked about it was the olive green color; it was true to the picture."
2.0,"Black beads described as obsidian, the beads are plastic beads."
2.0,Well I've had it on for about 4 hours now and it hasn't made me sweat. Thought it would help with weight loss.
2.0,I ordered this glasses thinking it is bigger.  I also ordered 2 black and one brown but I got an orange one instead of brown.  It looks like it will breal anytime soon.  Hopefully I am wrong
2.0,"My own fault for buying a top with horizontal stripes, but there is no shape to this tank."
2.0,"Well-made, nice feel.  But:<br /><br />1.  Larger than necessary.  The currency compartment is both longer and deeper than necessary to fit US money.  Trimming the size of that compartment would trim the overall size of the folded wallet, which I would like better.<br />2.  As many others have noted, the credit card slots start out very, very, very tight.  I really had to work to get mine in, then was almost unable to get one of the card out again - and I consider myself to have pretty strong hands. I'm sure the leather will ease with time, but it will be a real struggle until then.<br />3.  The coin compartment is awkward, as others have also noted.  It's too small for more than a few coins, and it is necessary to be paying attention when opening it to be sure the coins don't fall out.<br /><br />I bought a different tri-fold that's the same size, but that doesn't have the problems with the card slots and the coin compartment.  I'm much happier with it."
2.0,"It's a pretty color, and the material feels nice, but it was smaller than expected.  I will hold onto and give away, but will not order again."
2.0,"These are cute sunglasses, however do not get them if your child is tough on things. My daughter broke both pairs in the first day..."
2.0,"It's very pretty, but sheds constantly. I put it threw the wash twice and it still leaves fibers on my clothes and hair every time I wear it."
2.0,"They are really cute , but very cheap fall apart within a few months of indoor use."
2.0,"2 stars for being cozy but the white area is completely see-through. It looks like an afterthought. Like, ""Well, we didn't design this bottom part quite right, let's throw some white fabric up there!"" Too much hassle to return but I definitely wouldn't buy these again."
2.0,"I wanted to love this shirt, because the bright royal blue was perfect.  But I was disappointed in the quality of the materials and the workmanship--if it was 1/2 the price, I might have kept it."
2.0,"As I was putting my 1yr old into this outfit, the suspended buckle broke so I never got to use the suspenders. Not really good quality, but the onesie was fine."
2.0,"Petty dress but didn't fit well on the sides ( under the arms), just not a smooth fit and alterations would not correct the issue."
2.0,"Beautiful at first, but disappointing. The large stones are dyed and it comes off. I had blue on my neck. I cleaned off the dye with alcohol and the stones turned out to be a grayish blue. I can now use the necklace without dye coming off on my skin. The cleaned stones are still interesting even though not as bright."
2.0,"Extremely long, hits mid thigh on me at 5' 6"". Tight across the chest and tent like everywhere else. Maybe it would be okay belted."
2.0,"Right out of the package, these look super duper small and the material is a very heavy almost neoprene ?? They're like really thick bathing suit material. I sent them right back. Gross."
2.0,"These are cute and they aren't too expensive... however, the frames snapped while they were in their ""protective"" sleeve in the baby bag (in a side pocket, not underneath anything).  Flimsy."
2.0,Super thin- doesn’t look like the picture at all. If your looking for a nice Santa hat this is not it. It’s more like a thin stocking cap.
2.0,"The elastic band and cord in the waist kept twisting inside and would not lie flat against the waist which is uncomfortable.  Otherwise, I love the shorts.  Won’t buy another pair though because of the poor quality elastic band."
2.0,Really small!  Wish depiction were more accurate. If you like long dangling earrings these are probably not for you.
2.0,Not as fitted as I expected.  Not as long as pictured on model.  Threads coming loose on all 3 shirts at delivery.
2.0,Zipper zips from the wrong side. Annoying. I think it's the way female zippers work.
2.0,After 1 month the knots feel apart.
2.0,This was not horrible but it did not do me enough justice to keep or want to share with anyone else. The shorts were very comfortable but too large/tall and the top was awkwardly short. It also had a smell out of the bag that was a little intense.
2.0,These boots are cute. I loved the buckles and the light fur lining on the inside of the boots. I would keep them but the color is a bright tomato red the for isn't the same shade as the actual boot. I tried to persuade myself to keep them but the shade of red i just can't get with. Sadly they are going back. 😔
2.0,Too thin and the coat looks cheap and ia light weight. Does not look the same as on the internet. I wanted a nice heavy coat. Plus the sleeves seemed too short.
2.0,"I hate it , it doesn't even come with the yin yang thing ."
2.0,"thought it would of been tight fitted, but the small is baggy."
2.0,I loved everything about these glasses except they just weren’t dark enough for the AZ sun.
2.0,"Yo soy talla M y el producto es mas grande que una talla M,me quedó grande"
2.0,Not giftable
2.0,"I bought these for my kid to wear at school, but they keep falling down anytime he opens his mouth (which is a lot)."
2.0,Fabric was see through and scratchy.  Dress was also very poorly made.  I returned this item.  It wasn't nearly as elegant or pretty as the picture looked.
2.0,I could have purchased an amythest bracelet (actual) for even less but thought this looked pretty. Its cheap looking in person.
2.0,again no return info
2.0,Very long and doesn't sit properly on your hand
2.0,product design is pretty - although it is small.
2.0,I wear a women's size 7 (US) and these socks barely fit/hurt my feet after a while of wearing them.
2.0,"Nice cover up, but only covered torso...thought it would at least cover the top portion of my bottom so that I could walk around the resort semi-covered. I am 5'7 and 120 lbs...maybe better for a shorter woman....returned it...."
2.0,"I gave a two star review because out of the 3 pairs I purchased (in one pack), one fit fine, another one leg fit perfect and the other leg is at least 2 sizes bigger. The third pair fit okay but the tummy and waist are too big for the size of this Capri. disappointed."
2.0,"The photo of the pullover appears to show a stand-up collar.  However, the collar is very  flimsy and simply rolls under - which I find most unattractive.  I do like the design of the garment, but I  would not buy it again because of the collar and would not recommend it."
2.0,Great product. I've had them for a little bit and absolutely love them. But one broke already and I did not even wear that band a lot.
2.0,The pearls were too much.
2.0,"I love Pattyboutik and have over 20 tops from this brand. I have also bought from the maternity line and love those tops and the maternity ruched dresses as well.  But I just don't like these dresses because of the material. The fit is right and so is the length but the polyester is really cheap to me and I don't like the feel of it on my skin.<br /><br />Pattyboutik, please make this exact dress style in the jersey/spandex material you make most of your shirts out of and I'll buy a dozen of those too!"
2.0,"I bought these when my daughter was just a few months old. They were TIGHT.  I love the colors they come in, but I needed to wear them first for a few hours to stretch them out, and even then, they would be too tight on her. So for overa year, they've just been in her bin of bows and headbands, unused. Except for 2 I've managed to stretch out enough over time for my own use."
2.0,too short side ways
2.0,I like Delisa clothing but this was not as nice in quality.  Not like photo.
2.0,The sleeves were unflattering. The dress was plain and the material was just silky loose. The dress without the sleeves would be okay for a simple look
2.0,"I have to say, I’m spoiled and have been wearing Oakley Lenses for well over 20 years. These do not meet the standards of Oakley lenses. The way they have layered the materials of these lenses cause me to get a major headache. If I simply look straight and don’t move my eyes then they are fine, but once your eyes moves and you look around, it creates a strain on my eyes and gives me a headache. May be good for those of you that are used to cheaper no name glasses."
2.0,"So after a few months, the screw got lost, i don't know how it got loose and came out of the belt, next thing i know, it wasn't there anymore and then the belt loop came out too. The material is great but it was poor made."
2.0,Small and changes color immediately
2.0,"These were very pretty with nice, soft leather but are being returned. I normally wear a medium glove but found these to be tight across the palm and too long in the fingers"
2.0,It does not look like the picture in person. It looks like a patch was ironed on the shirt. A bit dull with not much sparkle.
2.0,"Extremely off size. It runs at leadt 2 sizes smaller.<br />I returned the product, and after 2 and half weeks later, I received credit back. Slow service."
2.0,"The links were easy to move, but the links pinches your arm hairs, and it eventually fell apart one day while I was walking."
2.0,I just received my pajama set. Very cute blue star pattern but it’s literally unraveling at the seams right out of the package. Save your time and money and look for another pj set.
2.0,This shirt is way too small.  Disappointed
2.0,"The band is cute.  The white dots are not as pictured.  They are much lighter.  It took awhile for delivery, but I was pretty happy once I received it and the price was great.  Well it turned out to be too good to be true.  Only lasted a few months and is already splitting and about to break apart above the window.  I wear mine pretty much 24/7 except to shower and it just didn't hold up."
2.0,Runs way small.  Asian made &#34;XL&#34; = US large.
2.0,It does not look like the picture. The one I received looks like a cloudy piece of glass.
2.0,it's a lot smaller than you think. Hard to read.
2.0,"This material is pretty much like you see online, but it doesn't fit as you'd think. The waist of the pants is just off fitting. You will be constantly pulling them up, even though they feel like they fit!"
2.0,Really stiff and uncomfortable.
2.0,I think that it is a very nice looking watch but it ended up being enormous on me. The band is FAR too big. I've always known I have smaller wrists but I don't see how this watch could fit anyone. I am returning it right away.
2.0,I gave a shirt to Stars and the reason is because it's too short not too small around I'm 5 feet and 5 and 1/2 in and 145 lb. I believe I bought an extra large the print is beautiful I just wish it was longer
2.0,Ok...I like the cardigan only for the price. Order a size up if you must have this. Also I was VERY disappointed with the elbow patches. It looked like a first grader cut the circles and the sewing on this item was horrible. It gets two stars because I like the color. See the picture I’ve attached.
2.0,Really cute...one arrived broken.
2.0,Very small and short.
2.0,"I’m so sad these cute earrings didn’t last long. I bought them for my 5 year old because she was having issues getting the backs of earrings imbedded into her skin. The hoops helped that problem, but the clasp on one of them broke within a week."
2.0,"I bought two different colors of this dress and both patterns were as pictured and very pretty. I never considered myself someone with a long torso, but maybe I am? because the dress did not even cover my butt with the straps completely extended. Going up a size only increases the length 0.4 inches and because the dress was looser throughout already, I don't think its worth it to size up. Other than the length the dress was perfect. It is flowy not form fitting, which I liked. Hopefully this dress works better for others out there because I really wanted to like this dress."
2.0,The leather quality was ok<br />However I was disappointed because they advertise it as magnetic clap which it is not it's a regular clap with a male to female clap
2.0,"The palm rests/pads are kinda what you'd expect. And the pads aren't really breathable or pleasant to rest your wrists on for hours. It's good that this product exists but it doesn't seem like they put a ton of effort into the design.<br /><br />It's good that the pads are kinda adjustable. But the palm supports without the pads slope downwards towards you, so if you don't use the sticky pads, you can't really put a homemade pad (e.g. a piece of cloth) on top, because it will slide off.<br /><br />I bought these thinking I'd take a chance since I type a lot and it might be worth it. But my previous solution of using washcloths as palm rests works better, honestly. I returned these and went back to that."
2.0,This hat seems well made but the description as &#34;one size fits&#34; all is not accurate.<br />I do have a small head for a man my size but it would have to be a pretty large woman for this to be OK&#62;
2.0,"I had to wash it twice... still has a slight smell... :( I love the dress- but, it is stinky!!!"
2.0,"While the price is good, I had to return them. There is no way this bra would support &#34;my girls&#34; (38 C) for a yoga class, let alone a high impact workout. These bras are probably fine for smaller breasted women, but for those of us with more than a handful, look elsewhere for the proper support"
2.0,This bag is huge! I'm a big bag girl but this is outrageous. My co workers say that I need to move my suitcase when I bring in my average size bag but this is out of control. I sent it back. The material was a little cheap too.
2.0,"Very cheaply made, way too small."
2.0,Cross--body strap is too small for tall people.
2.0,Not the greatest shirt. The pink began to fade away after the second wash. Too bad because my daughter really liked it.
2.0,Fit great the first few days but then stretched out and were too big. Couldn’t wear them<br />anymore. Buy them a size too small so they will fit after wearing for a bit
2.0,"At first, i thought these boots would be perfect because of the zipper on the side which makes it a lot easier to get a toddlers foot into, but after only really wearing them a few times, the fabric has ripped on the side of the zipper and now the boots are not tight enough to stay on. Very disappointed"
2.0,Paper thin u comfortable material
2.0,"I bought this as a gift for my dad. He is always looking for aprons with extra long ties that double around. That is what this product advertised, but the ties would only be extra long for a small female, not a full grown man. Very disappointed."
2.0,The lenses are hard to clean because they immediately pop out when touched
2.0,"Made in China. This is how I felt about it. For the price I paid and for the quality of it... it was not worth it. The color was not what I was expecting. It was a cheap off white color. The dress is very thin and shows everything from creases of underwear line to bra line. The dress does run up a size to big. I just wished it was thicker. If you do purchase it, I’d recommend a skirt liner and a shirt underneath unless you cover it up with a shawl."
2.0,Not Brass.  So cheaply made it broke putting it on.  Got two stars because it was delivered on time.  Will not be buying again.
2.0,Beautiful shirt... Did not fit as advertised.. Gave it to a friend.. He loves it
2.0,The leather is glued to the outer buckle and it has lifted. I may need to return it if the glue I used doesn't work. I bought the small size and it was still too big so I had to poke another hole in the band with an earring post and an embroidery needle. I used Tacky Glue to keep the leather piece glued down to the outer buckle. It is comfortable but I should not have had to reglue the leather buckle or poke another hole in the band just to make it fit. I've had it for about 3 days and it seems to be working okay. I will not purchase another one.
2.0,"I am 5'7&#34; so not short by any means. I wear a 34D and medium (size 6) clothing, this is too big for me. I will have to get out my sewing needles and make the straps shorter if I am to get any use out of this. The straps are not in anyway adjustable. The lace is pretty and seems to be of a decent quality. The price point is low enough that I will try to alter this rather than send it back. I gave it two stars because the material is nice but since I cannot wear it as it is I would have given it 1 star otherwise."
2.0,Looks nothing like this. Small and shear.
2.0,The silver color was way off.
2.0,"Although this is a nice looking design at a very inexpensive price, the plastic holding the sunglasses warped after a day in the car where the outside temperature was in the high 90 degrees. The warped material prevented the holder to fully close causing my sunglasses to constantly fall out. The product would not bend back into place. I ended up throwing this product away, I do not recommend this product."
2.0,"Very stiff.  Might be fine for other jobs, but don't care for them for cutting fabric with a rotary cutter."
2.0,"This one seemed to be a little thicker, I didn't like the feel. Love all the others fit and feel."
2.0,"Glasses ok, could not use them, spring popped out, my numb and arthritis fingers could not put it back together, that simple,"
2.0,Was smaller than I assumed. Didn’t fit<br />Over mouth and nose correctly but worked for my wife and she liked it. Just not versatile like other masks that I have bought
2.0,This is obviously a cute yet strange dress. I'm normally a 6 juniors /2-4 in womens. This fit like a garbage bag. I put it back in the bag to return it 10 minutes after it arrived.
2.0,I ordered 3 rings and they were supposed to be sterling silver but they turned my finger and the gold wore off the smiley face. I get that you get what you pay for but I would like to have the item as described...
2.0,Loose charms in bag that I guess came off from undone bracelets. I was sooo looking forward for them… great disappointment. Gave them to my niece to play with… not worth returning them.
2.0,"A pesar de que es talla M , es muy grande!!!"
2.0,Returned. Too small and did not like material.
2.0,"Two of the pair in this set fit great, the others were so tight (and I do not have big ankles or calves) that I threw them away.  The quality is fair, but I would not recommend if you want comfy work socks."
2.0,Band size is correct and comfortable but cup size is off by 1 cup and not enough breast support
2.0,The colour is not as advertised. It is not hot red but muted wine. Fabric is really not very nice quality at all.
2.0,I had the band about 3 months and a wire started sticking out.
2.0,All the stitches were visible and some were coming off of the cloth. Bad quality . color was as shown
2.0,Beautiful product but it's only one
2.0,It works fantastic however mine started to solidify in the can after two months it must have been a defective can.
2.0,It didn't cost much. It looks very cheap.
2.0,Look nothing like the picture. They are still nice. But nothing on what's being advertised
2.0,very tight material order 2 sizes up
2.0,The light blue layer got broken
2.0,It isn't going to work if your titties are big
2.0,"I've bought these dresses in previous years and could literally live in them, they're so comfortable and easy to launder. Unfortunately I purchased two more this season and they are awful! The material is no longer soft and breathable -- it's now slick, shinier and artificial-feeling and doesn't breathe like the former. It's also more sheer so that my bra shows through, and more clingy (not in a good way). I also noticed the neckline is a little bit higher so it feels uncomfortable. I immediately sent both back and am SO disappointed!"
2.0,"I ordered small and it is huge. I don't think this is an issue that could be solved by sizing down. It just has an odd, baggy fit I do not prefer for a vest layer."
2.0,"I bought these gloves thinking they were going to be warm and perfect for what I was seeking. For people whom are not aware, please know that there is also a slit in the thumb so the thumb can come out as well. That may be fine for you, but there was a constant breeze leaving my thumb cold. The stitching around the Velcro pieces (that hold the finger flap back) came loose a few days after wearing them and the finger holes began to tear. In all, I think these gloves were very cheaply made and should not be priced at the price they are."
2.0,The watch is pretty. It only worked for about 1 week before the time could not keep up. If I said it in about 2 hours the time is over an hour behind. The band isn’t super comfortable either.
2.0,"The purse is attractive, but IT HAS A VERY UNPLEASANT ODOR.  I aired it out for a day, wiped it with Lysol wipes and have just sprayed it with Lysol spray. Nothing has worked yet."
2.0,They break u can not actually use them as a lanyard
2.0,"If the chain was long enough for an adult neck & didn't come apart so easily, it'd be perfect."
2.0,"Glasses arrived in good condition. They were very flat and required some bending to get a natural fit. I'd found same quality shades for half the price on amazon in the past, but couldn't remember the brand or seller. Still a decent deal."
2.0,I am 5'8&#34; and 150lbs. The pictures don't show the darts that are vertically placed on the abdomen. It creates a very hourglass shape with a waist incredibly small. The sleeves were uncomfortably tight and the dress was SOO short. I would not be able to bend over in the slightest or everything would be showing.<br /><br />Pro: The color and lace design is absolutely gorgeous!! I would only suggest this dress for a short and slim female.
2.0,Great design cheap quality
2.0,These are very long. Seems on the side are coming out and have only worn the 3 or 4 times.
2.0,I ordered a X large as I usually wear large but it was to small it would have fit someone with a medium built
2.0,"The chaos is very short, doesn’t look great, the pendant ok."
2.0,Fits good. Except the socks were a large like for an adult. I ordered at 2t 3t for my toddler. Thought that was strange!
2.0,The length of the sleeves and torso was great but the speckled lines within the material and color were underwhelming.
2.0,hat is sharp looking but fits my 9 and 11 year old not the &#34;Sully&#34; nicknamed 18 year old it was purchased for.
2.0,Don't plan on wearing this if you have a backside. Way too small. Order up a size if you can.
2.0,"I'm 5'9"", 130 lbs.  I typically wear a size S in Patty Boutik.<br /><br />While the material & cut were very cute, the waist hit at a very awkward spot on my ribcage, so I ended up returning the dress.  If you are tall or long-torsoed, this is not the dress for you.  Too bad!<br /><br />Leaving feedback in case it helps anyone else out."
2.0,I'm very disappointed about how short this is. I should have read the reviews before I bought it. I still love the pattern though.
2.0,toes are especially small should have gone with the toeless model
2.0,"Ok for kids shirt , not the BEST quality"
2.0,I purchased this dress to wear on a cruise. I am very disappointed in the fact that when washes on a delicate cycle and line dried the dress shrunk to the point I can not whear it.
2.0,Didn’t fit around the bust area … order size up
2.0,"Very loose fitting, they fall down as I wear them and don’t have the normal elastic feel of leggings. I usually wear a large and bought a large. The material feels cheap too."
2.0,The hook arrived completely deformed and unusable.
2.0,"It just doesn’t look like in the picture, and it’s way too long."
2.0,"Pretty color. As expected however, it didn't look like it  does in the pictures shown. The pockets aren't down in the front  they're at the side and higher than shown. The models are stretching them down an pulling them to the front making it look like it's fitted around the hips and hangs sort of cowled around you body.  Looks very cool on them but nothing like that in reality."
2.0,Don't believe these are solid brass; fair quality plating of something brassy-looking.
2.0,it was supposed to come with a side pocket and it didn’t.
2.0,"The cap that arrived was way to large, and fit more like a Bernie then an actual cap. I was very disappointed, be careful when you buy this. Great build quality, made in Germany, great camo pattern, and style, size and fit is the main complaint of this product."
2.0,Daughter loves them but one shoe quit working and wont take a charge in the first week of wearing
2.0,"I was expecting the entire sports bra to be elastic but the shoulder straps were too lose and since it wasn't stretch material in the shoulders, it just didn't fit right."
2.0,The top sheer part of the dress was very stiff. It didn’t lay correctly and bubbled so I sent it back.
2.0,Buckle is made of stamped steel
2.0,Cute but not worth $23. I would say closer to $10 or $15.
2.0,"Good purse at first. The metal is gold not silver as it appears in the photo. Did have a bit of chemical smell when first delivered, but that disappated quickly. I have received many compliments on the color; however, after a couple of months, the black lining started separating from the handles and one of the handles even broke off. I was not a rough user of this purse and I would expected it to much more durable."
2.0,The pants sent were XL. I ordered 2XL. That's XX. The replacement did not show up.<br />The fabric in pic is distressed and fits at hip with a long and baggy leg. The product was bright and not  distressed as shown.<br />I still don't have my replacement.? Why?
2.0,I normally wear a 2x and ordered a 3x.  This suit fit more like a Large and will no way fit a 3x size women.  If you still want this suit go up in size and disregard your normal size.
2.0,Would make nice pajamas
2.0,"Not very impressed with this top. Although it arrived as promised and the correct color it has some serious design issues. The material is light weight and the tie up feature is perfect- but there is a serious problem. I can't lift/move my arms around!!!! Hugging someone would be impossible, reaching for something etc. I am excited to wear this top eventually but am positive it will end in an outfit malfunction before the day is done. I ordered a medium. I am a B cup. Should have gone with a large?? Who knows. Doesn't fit correctly and I do not believe sizing up to a large would correct the problem.."
2.0,I did not like the looks of the skirt
2.0,Got taken for a ride with this one. I ordered 2 jumpsuits-both small. The other one (different company) fits great. This one is at least 2 inches too short and too snug around arms. (I'm 120 lbs and 5'8&#34; so small works in most things. This is juniors size at best. Cute fabric and seems well made so 2 stars. I hate returning items.
2.0,"I gave this one a try due to price but the material is thin, hardware looks and feels cheap, and the gray color is off.  For a few more dollars you can get a much better product. 2.5 stars"
2.0,Demasiado pequeño y delgado para el precio
2.0,"These were fine when they arrived, but my daughter is complaining that many of these are getting holes in them. We bought them 2. 5 months ago."
2.0,"I love the face on the watch, super simple and cute.  The color of the gold is way too tacky looking for my taste, yes for the price of the watch I understand that you get what you pay for, but the color is really just too fake and has an orangey gold look. Unfortunately I can not get passed the color and that's the main reason for the return."
2.0,Defective tailoring. Had to return it.
2.0,The cut doesn't fit my kid. XL barely fit over his head.
2.0,It was actually a plus sized dress and slightly frumpy looking. Maybe because I’m only 5’1” it went below my knees and looked odd.
2.0,Way too thick. This thing sticks out like a helmet.
2.0,"Very scratchy!  I've owned other sequined tops that use &#34;soft&#34; sequins, but this is not one of those.  I couldn't keep it on for more than 30 seconds.  I'm not sure how you would wear this - over an Underarmor shirt?  I love the style, it's very pretty, but I can't see myself ever wearing it, so it's getting returned!"
2.0,"My daughter loved this dress .. unfortunately less than 2 weeks of having it-the dress shoulders easily tore off, specifically the tule material."
2.0,Small is still a little large
2.0,"The leather on the pearl necklace had a smell to it that did not go away, and the shell necklace was not a choker, but was very loose, and many of the shells were backwards."
2.0,"The item appears as print, but the material was not what i expected."
2.0,I dont like it at all!!!
2.0,"I thought this was a bracelet kit. Kind of pricey for these bracelets. Mark up must be high. They're ok, but I suppose the recepients will use them."
2.0,"I love the skirt. I am a U.S. 16. The skirt came right below my knees (I am 5'2). Fabric is okay. it stretches.  I purchased the XXL. It fits perfect, but I did not get the black belt with the skirt. It has the belt loops. Now I need a belt to wear with the skirt. I am giving it a 2 star since I did not get everything I paid for, which was a skirt and belt. Other then that, it would have been perfect (five star perfect)."
2.0,Larger than the average 3-6 months size. Will not be able to wear for holiday
2.0,"Cheap, turned ankle green in just 1 day."
2.0,"Poor quality. Initially fit as expected, washed and is now shorter and doesn’t fit properly. Item was worn once, washed in cold water and hung to dry. Texture and quality changed. Shirt shrank and collar stretched. Can no longer be used. It now looks like a kid pajama top quality wise. Total waste of money and disappointing."
2.0,"It took me 30 minutes to close this earring, even once I flipped it around and closed it backwards. I measured these and they are 6mm, not 10mm. The earring is fine once on, but I wanted something that is actually 10 mm."
2.0,I'm concerned.  The carbon filters are not held in place at all within the mask.  Slide around so very little confidence they provide any filtration.  This is decoration to tick the box - meet the requirement of having a mask on if required.  But breathing is not filtered through the inserted filter and no nose clip means it doesn't filter anything.  Your breathing just blows in and out at the top around your nose.  Oh well. They said it was a decoration.
2.0,Cup size is much smaller than American sizing
2.0,"This is a length of nylon webbing with a plastic buckle on the end. The webbing is of good quality, but is fairly thick and not at all flexible. This is not a stretch belt, the material is not elastic. The stiffness of the webbing makes it hard to close the buckle. I have a normal waistline and pulled it tight to hold my pants up. The buckle winds up sticking out when cinched creating a big lump that looks ridiculous with a shirt over it. Because it doesn't close in the classic sense it also tends to slip. When you pull tighter to stop it from slipping it's uncomfortable. Not much thought was given to designing a functional belt. The quality is okay, but the design is a flop."
2.0,Looks like a little girls play necklace
2.0,"Unfortunately, I returned this item.  The material felt very cheap.  There is also a seam that goes a little above the waist line that was very unattractive on a larger size woman."
2.0,"I ordered my husband a 3XL - he normally wears a 36 waist - and it was WAY too small. Not only that, the shipping time they give is a week from ordering, which is BS because it actually says ships a week AFTER PROCESSED. It took these things over A MONTH to reach me. And then they didn't even fit. Needless to say I'm returning them. It's a shame because we waited so long AND the pants themselves are REALLY beautiful and nice quality, just whoever is selling them doesn't know what they are doing."
2.0,Spend more money and get a better quality bangle(bracelet).  There's a reason why it's on sell!
2.0,Ordered a large and fits like an<br />x-small..material and style were nice
2.0,Make a very small difference I'm not really shore buying them was worth it
2.0,Wish it wasn’t all connected
2.0,"The watch was very beautiful, but it was too large for my wrist.  So, I made request for return/refund only to  be informed by the seller that I was responsible for the return shipping charges to Japan.  I was shocked to learn how much money that would be.  I appealed to Amazon---again shocked."
2.0,The material is hard and it's not flattering.
2.0,not much of a progressive lens and mostly reading only.
2.0,"It’s NOT meant for bottom curvy women. I have fairly wide hips, and this fits everywhere, but wouldn’t go over my hips. The seam wouldn’t go down. So sad, cause it’s adorable"
2.0,"It's see through, and the material is cheap. It looks much better in the picture."
2.0,"It must be made for men with either wider feet or thicker feet than mine.( I am 5'7&#34; and 193 lbs)  The toes always come over the edge of the slipper when pushing the foot all the way in for a snug fit. I tried a size 9, a size 10 and a size 11 and the toes always came over the edge. It is such a shame because the look and the price were good. The only way the slipper would ever fit is if I tried them on with socks. That would be OK if I was just wearing them around the house but I wanted to be able to go on errands or to the beach wearing them too."
2.0,"The sweater is very thin, short and it is US Women Medium size and NOT S- XL fit for sure!!!"
2.0,"It doesn't do what it supposed to do, thecup sizes are way too small and unfortunately does not stay adherent after the first couple of wears! The only reason i give it two stars is for the material sounds good i hoped it worked as claimed! May it will work for small cups if you are not just dont buy!!"
2.0,uh yeah... the stud will NOT come off........
2.0,"Appears to be well made.  The fit is terrible!<br /><br />Approximately 4 to 5 inches too short in the bodice.<br /><br /> I am 6' 150 pounds.  I am super skinny and a medium should fit all day long.<br /><br />The waistline hits about mid nippm<br />le or just below.<br /><br /> I could not get the dress to zip because the waistline hit me at the breast.  I pulled it down then I couldn't get my sleeves on my arms.<br /><br /> Bodice is about 5"" too short.  This is not an Empire waist dress and I don't believe the waistline is supposed to hit you mid breast.  In addition, when I put the dress on in my arms are through the sleeve holes the waistline comes up to my breast and I can't get shut with the zipper.<br /><br /> If I pull it down and the waistline sits where it is supposed to on my waist, I cannot put my arms through the sleeves.<br /><br /> I am very thin and small busted.  I even had to take off my bra because the waistline of the dress was digging into my bra.<br /><br />Not sure if this is just a defective product."
2.0,Lace was torn on all of these
2.0,Jacket fits fine. Pants run small
2.0,"These pants looked great and the fit is flattering when I first tried them on. I didn’t realize at first that the crotch area was significantly thin or sort of worn out looking. It is unusual, like maybe the pants were worn by someone prior to me purchasing them because that is the only thing I can think of that would wear out the pants in crotch area in the way these were. Also, the first time I washed these pants on cold and hung to dry, the little elastic fibers were visible all along the seams as if I had put them in the dryer on hot for an hour or something. I think these pants look good on and are comfortable but after 2 washes I can’t wear them again."
2.0,"Beautiful necklace, however the chain broke after one wearing."
2.0,"I returned both items in the same package since they were both going back to the same place... or so I thought, so how are we going to correct this issue.  I have been refunded for the other dress because that was the return label I used on the package.  The other return label and return information for the other dress is inside the package with both dresses"
2.0,"Material soft, but don't think it will hold up"
2.0,"My 8 year old daughter was excited to get these just to find out they run really small, we got the largest size and they fit her very tight. Unfortunately we are not able to use them and will look for bigger ones."
2.0,These slipper socks are poorly made IMO. I was given a pair of Roget slipper socks that are made much better. I would buy them instead.
2.0,"I like the watch to be honest it’s nice but I’m only giving u two stars until I get the bracelet which never came, only the watch and the bracelet is why I bought it in the first place"
2.0,Returned the watches ... did not care for clasp
2.0,"Not as expected, very cheap like material. Not worth the price, I am returning this item. I think I should have thought more about how many reviews this product had and the price of it compared to other hats like this one. I wanted a style like this for summer to be stylish and to keep sun off of my face and shoulders more!"
2.0,It is very small and skirt is very short
2.0,Thought I was getting real Persol lenses but they were plastic and didn't fit tight in the frame.
2.0,"The clasps aren't closed tightly enough to hold a flat mask strap, so the strap slips out very easily, defeating the purpose of the lanyard.  Probably a round, thick mask strap would stay in place."
2.0,"I gave 2 stars because the mask looks cool, but it is somewhat ill-fitting, and the inner layer of material feels like it was woven from cactus thread.  It just is not very comfortable"
2.0,Not impressed. The polarized lens are cheap. They do not block the glare by any means. The glasses do run big on me. They’re super flimsy as well.
2.0,"Cute design, flattering, but ripped the first time I wore it. I thought it may have been just the one item, so I ordered again and the next one did the same thing."
2.0,"I had to buy a few workout bras with straight straps while an injury healed where regular cross or racer-back straps usually fall. This one was VERY heavily padded, moderately supportive, and quite pretty, but one of the only 2 hook & eye fasteners utterly disintegrated after only one wear and wash. Disappointing, especially because I bought a similar bra from the same company on the same day and it's my new favorite."
2.0,Out of the package these are great and exactly what I was looking for. But after one wash they loose the silky feel and turn more velvety.  A little disappointed for the price.
2.0,The material felt ok. And the embroidery was nice. However I am 5 foot 11 inches tall and big in the chest at a 46DDD and the dress would not make it over my girls. So sad but it being returned.
2.0,"Thou these are versatile and comfortable they came VERY LATE, the colors in the picture are not what I received!!<br />I'll probably keep them but, I won't order from this company in the future!<br />I was told they were lost, whatever that meant and after almost 2months, I just got them in my mail yesterday!!!"
2.0,"This is a very cheaply made helmet. All foam padding and not true to size. I order a Large which I wear in most helmets and what I bought in a BELL, this helmet just flopped all over my head. Not worth the money in my opinion and not worth the risk of injury."
2.0,i bought a 4 xl  but i fit like a medium or even a small. gave it to my kid
2.0,Read somewhere the sleeves run a bit longer.  I have longer arms and the sleeves run very short.  Otherwise nice shirt and fits to size but won’t buy again.
2.0,The non skid dots fall off while you are exercising. Be warned if you are doing barre class they will rub off on the carpet. Might be good for other activities.
2.0,"Pins holding the band on constantly pop off. It’s mildly comfortable and the band seems like it will last a while However, I nearly lost my watch at the store when the pin popped off AGAIN which a huge disappointment."
2.0,The earrings base was totally bend
2.0,"Don't like the fabric, and it came wrinkled, so I suspect it to be difficult to iron, as well. the color looks more flat in person,  I just did not like the fit, either. would not recommend unless you are stick skinny. and flat chested--not a good look for someone with a bust. It will serve as a housedress, not one to wear out anywhere."
2.0,Dress is nothing like the picture. Very ugly in person and looked like a huge piece lace. I returned.
2.0,"I loved this dress!  But it wasn't a good fit for me.  You can't wear a bra and if you have a smaller chest area, it just doesn't fit right. Perfect for fuller chested ladies."
2.0,It looks like a very nice quality in the photos but was definitely extremely cheaply made at best. The shoulder straps are the quality of a Halloween costume😏 and it was much shorter than I'd thought it was gonna be. I returned it.
2.0,Waste of money does not isolate vibrations
2.0,It was too cheap looking..the hood fur looked awful and the coat just was not the best representation that I saw online..
2.0,My exact size but were too small. Did not get to try them on for weeks and no longer have the tags. Were about two to three sizes to small.
2.0,"not leather, as stated"
2.0,I am disappointed we saw this at Walmart and should have gotten it then. My kiddo normally wears a 14/16 and this fit more like a 10/12.  Lesson learned
2.0,Not the material in picture but it works for me. It’s that stretchy cottony polyestery material (not very forgiving all bent and dents will be on display)
2.0,"The insoles separated immediately, following the first use and they run a little smaller (in length) than anticipated; I did measure before buying. The fabric is fraying slightly at the seems after a month of use, but not too bad. They do bend and flex like I wanted. My toddler has wide feet and does keep them on despite the insoles not staying put; he wouldn't keep other stiffer brands on. However, I do feel the need to replace them because of the insoles."
2.0,I like accessories
2.0,Ordered the size according to the chart and it doesn’t come close to fitting
2.0,"True to size, And soft fabric but the tag is sewn on the outside of the shirt with the sizing and all. The buttons are really cheap and fell off. Would not buy again"
2.0,The product is not what was pictured and feel like its another bait and switch...
2.0,thin..way too big need to downsize at least two sizes
2.0,These masks would be a lot better if they had more stretch to them.
2.0,Teva makes great sandals - no questions. They are comfortable and durable. The problem is that they lack any antibacterial covering. Thus after a few week they end up smelling like... Skip this sandals look for another brand.
2.0,"It was pink instead of brown, and the collar doesn't split at the top it's just a regular crew neck. I'll still wear it, but it's not as cute as the picture."
2.0,They are kind of scratchy and stretch out while you're wearing them.
2.0,"I like the appearance of the cap but not how it wears. I prefer a cap that is more firm/stiff that holds it shape better. The material feels on the light side, not firm/strong enough to hold its shape without having my head shoved up into it. in order to get a good round shape/appearance I have to force the cap all the way down snugly onto my head. If I don't do that, it sinks in the middle; not a good look."
2.0,This is beautiful. Sadly it was a fail outside that. As you can see in my picure it fell apart post haste.
2.0,The orange was pretty light...think more like creamcicle rather than the deep orange that is shown in the image.
2.0,"Strap is functional, but uses low quality leather. I have big wrists and it barely fits on the widest setting, so the tail end of the strap with the holes pokes out a bit.  The leather also now has a very musky smell after wearing the watch in this Georgia heat for a few days with a bit of sweat.  It won't wash out and is just unpleasant."
2.0,"The leather on the watchband is very thin and flimsy.  Also, there is only one keeper for your band to go in to.  You have to fold the excess over or under.  The quick release pins seemed a bit small too."
2.0,Warm and soft but the outsides pill horribly and attract hair and fuzz. I have to spend way too much time picking stuff off of these so they're presentable enough for my daughter to wear them to school.
2.0,"Had high hopes for these since the straps on my backpack are always flapping in the wind on my motorcycle. The clips aren't strong enough and the straps come out pretty easily, so they havent helped."
2.0,Really short and didn’t care for it in person
2.0,One of the metal clips fell off after using it just a few times
2.0,It's very cheaply made and doesn't fit the description; it is NOT even close to backless :( I'm so disappointed. It doesn't look very much like the pic at all :(
2.0,"Great warm vest. The zipper is terrible though, fine tooth and very hard to get zipped."
2.0,"Loved the look in the picture, but I returned when I put it on it was too big not in size but just really bulky I could not even out my fingers together"
2.0,I love the picture but I was disappointed. The dress is see through :(
2.0,Hard to get it small enough without it looking bulky
2.0,The color is not as bright as the picture. Looks dull. The fabric is stretchy and is hard to keep the wrinkles out. I would have returned this dress because it is not what i was expecting. I would have loved this style in a cotton fabric and a truer color.
2.0,"Cheaply constructed, poorly matched stripes (actually no attempt made at all).  Returned, not even worth the Prime Day price."
2.0,This tunic is cut small on the arms & chest
2.0,Not soft at all. Not cozy looks good but material is not. White firing already falling out at bottom. Just walking around
2.0,My grandson wears a size 2T. I bought a 2T in this and the shirt is way too big. The shirt fabric is also too thin and the collar gapes. Looks cheap.
2.0,"These are just ok.  The liner doesn’t extend down as far as what the pictures depict, which is a disappointment.<br /><br />Edit: you absolutely cannot wear these for tennis.  If you have a ball in your pocket, it will quickly sling the pocket outside of the shorts for a really embarrassing look.  Do NOT expect these to be good tennis shorts at all."
2.0,This outfit was see through and to small. I ordered a size up and it was still tight. I couldn't even fit my legs in and the cardigan was super tight my arms. Never again.. Returned the same day
2.0,Great watch but not really unisex.. it's for women only
2.0,Looser in certain areas.
2.0,"I would not recommend this mask. It is not a good fitting and it hangs down oddly under the chin... extra fabric. There is no adjustment to the ear pieces that can be made to pull this back more so you don’t have all that extra awkwardly hanging fabric. Thought it would be a cute basic mask, but disappointed."
2.0,This mask would have been perfect if it didn’t come in broken... I don’t understand why they would put this delicate item in a Polly bag instead of a box... the bag was completely crushed inside my mailbox... completely unhappy...
2.0,"Cute design idea. Very thin materials, super cheaply made. Keeping it because I promised it to a friend. But I'm very disappointed. Was a gift."
2.0,The style of the dress was awkward on my body type. The upper body was too big and the lower body was too small. I ordered an L and normally wear an l. The body was too long for me and the waist was below my navel. I’m 5’7” I’m. It short. Overall just a fail for me.
2.0,Socks are thick and make it difficult to put on.
2.0,"mask is not life like as the picture, it's cheaply made wouldn't buy again"
2.0,I bought it and washed it once and it cracked.
2.0,"Awesome packing, beautiful watch but the only part that works is the minute and hour hands. The date and second hand do not move or change. Also, the band is really thick, like a mans watch, not a delicate woman's watch and its huge and practically falls off my hand."
2.0,"This is an adorable dress that is made of what feels like quality cotton & fits nicely; however, the placement of the buttons or buttonholes or both is a problem. There was gaping between buttons. This was not due to the top being too tight, because it wasn't at all. Unfortunately, I had to return this dress."
2.0,It was very snug to wear.  Wasn't what I expected.  I thought I could wear it around my neck loosely and pull it up when needed.  Not that simple due to its tightness.  Some stretch but not enough to be worn comfortable.
2.0,They do not have pockets
2.0,"Great service and glasses, however they did come extremely small and would have been nice if they wrote the size. I returned them."
2.0,Built Cheap  🤷🏾‍♂️
2.0,I had these glasses for less than a week and the arm of the glasses snapped in half while in my purse. And I didn't do anything crazy with my bag or anything.
2.0,The product its pretty and fits beautifully on the wrist. But it changed color after 24 hours of having it on. I'm not happy.
2.0,Very pretty from the picture. Felt it ran short and the fit was just not right. Today's style but not made well
2.0,"Runs small, I would suggest ordering larger than normal size. Still a very cute dress for my little sister to wear.... With shorts"
2.0,Ok. Very thin sock. I have bought skechers socks in past and were much better quality. These aren't going to last for years like last ones did. That's probably the point...
2.0,"too small once I put in three credit cards and my ID it was difficult to get them back out - only for someone who uses one or two cards as most - I returned it, and they graciously accepted my return - LOVE AMAZON!!"
2.0,Leaves fuzz on everything
2.0,Socks are super cool BUT very misleading. I bought these for my son (10) hes a huge Russell Wilson fan . The description says sockS and the picture makes it look like two pairs. HOWEVER I got them in mail it is only 1 pair of socks. The bright colored side is the front and the black white is back.  So by paying $22 +shipping/handling came close to $30 for ONE PAIR of socks. Wasn't very happy at all about it being so misleading!! Can't say id order again
2.0,Skirt was too big at the hips
2.0,Bought them for a Greta Van Fleet concert and there are gems missing :/ cute style tho!
2.0,Not a great quality shirt.  Old school scratchy cotton. Not really slim fit.
2.0,It was a cute sweater in the picture but nothing like what we received. It didn’t have the black eyeball part and the hands looked like sausages instead of a frog hand.
2.0,"This brooch was beautiful, but unfortunately the pin did not hold the brooch very well.  I only wore it for less than an hour because I was tired of the brooch falling off my dress."
2.0,Some of the &#34;gems&#34; were sloppily glued on.  I sent it back.<br />Maybe I just got a bad one.
2.0,"The top half looked amazing & very flattering!! The ""pant legs"" were more like capri/mid shin length instead of at the ankle. Did not look good with strappy heels as shown. Had to return. :("
2.0,Skirt is see through
2.0,The gold letters were missing 7 letters and only give you one of each letter
2.0,It's much bigger than I realized. Cute but haven't worn it once.
2.0,The color faded out from black with the first wash. The button came off due to it not being put on right. I was able to fix the button though.
2.0,Mens size large in dark navy w/orange trim comes with a woman's zipper.  Jacket looks great online and indeed the color was perfect match when I took it out. I wanted to like this jacket cause it took about 4 weeks for delivery ( as they advertised) price is awesome and if the zipper on wrong side is not a problem and you don't care about fit then it's OK but the bottom hem is awful in that its folds over itself ( hard to describe) but the quality is just not acceptable to me no matter the low cost. Cut is boxy to the most extreme. I'm 5'11 and 178 and I feel like I'm wearing a tablecloth made into a light jacket. Again I like the color and the material is fine. Flat out awful cut. Backwards zipper placement for mens jacket.
2.0,"I wanted to give this 5 stars, really comfortable and well made - However - it has a moldy mildew smell that is HORRIBLE!<br /><br />I washed the band with soap & water, then alcohol swabs, then tea tree oil, then baking soda toothpaste!!!  Nothing works!  It stinks!<br /><br />Such a disappointment for a good band!  I think the packaging just needs one of those mildew packets included in it and it would be fine.  An oversight from the manafacturer!"
2.0,"As an extremely frequent air traveler I was looking for one less thing to slow me down when traveling through airports.<br /><br />At first I loved the belt! It felt nice, looked great with any pants and it helped me breeze through security. I loved it so much within 5 months of purchasing the first one I bought a second one.<br /><br />The original one broke shortly after purchasing the second one (lasted only 5 months) and the second one has now broken just as the original one did but in just 4 months time.<br /><br />The leather and stitching is on point and have no complaints there.<br /><br />The plastic buckle on the other hand is absolutely the weak link. Both times the prong broke under no strain or excessive motion. It simply snapped while buckling in."
2.0,"II placed my Order on Dec 13th hoping I would get it around Christmas, as I had planned to give it as a gift to my sister. The item never shipped and they were giving me a ETA of around January 8th -24th of 2014! by then whos going to want to wear it, winter in LA will be over."
2.0,For cosmetic only they don't fit well
2.0,Way big in length and width.
2.0,This shirt did not fit correctly because it was cut in an odd way. It’s being returned...
2.0,"Getting lots of compliments on these shoes. Apparently these shoes were really popular back in the 90s and are now considered a budget brand. Fun fact.<br /><br />Update: Worn these to/from work for about a month and a half. Bear in mind, I work in an office and spend 95% of my day sitting, these shoes are gently used. The shoe laces are fraying apart at multiple points, makes me wonder how long the shoes will actually hold up."
2.0,"Its super cute, however it was super tight. I ended up giving it to my teen its the perfect baggy sweatshirt for her. I had ordered a 3x so it would be baggy on me 😒"
2.0,"The aprons are printed, not embroidered as it appears and they sent two same size aprons. So it was not for “mommy and me”."
2.0,"Shirt is much larger than expected! Ordered an XL after looking at sizing chart much bigger than measurements, wanted a lose fit but I drown in it; that's coming from a girl with a tripple d chest. Shipping came over a week late, however good quality shirt if it fit and waiting wasn't an issue!"
2.0,"The shirt fits fine, but the color is way off :( I returned it."
2.0,I mean runs TINY...albeit purchased as a joke but I feel like even one wash will do this in. Super small and thin fabric with hard printed piece.
2.0,"I ordered in an XL since it’s supposed to be unisex and let me tell you, this shirt was like a child’s xl."
2.0,"Runs very snug for me. It seems comfy, but my toes were really jammed upfront."
2.0,"I think with such mistake made with this item, I should get some kind of compensation. As you receive the box, you will see that it has a size 7 on the box and a size 10 inside the boot. Whoever packed this, was not paying attention. So looking forward in wearing these boots. Navy blue is hard to find and thought I had found just what I was looking for.  So disappointed when I knew they were too large, a size 10 instead of a 7. Barbara Rivenbark"
2.0,Shoes fit way too small.  I'm a 7.5 so I got an 8 &#34;just in case&#34; and I should have got a 9.  Very light and flimsy shoe.
2.0,"Material is decent for the price, and it’s quite comfortable. But this hat has wear bumps that just ruin the look."
2.0,The gold is sooooo yellow. You can tell it’s not real. And doesn’t match my other gold jewelry or necklaces that I wanted to layer it with.
2.0,Cute ring in photos but you can't see the writing ans the stones are almost microscopic. Not worth the money. The images on this are extremely inaccurate.
2.0,Very thin material and way too long.
2.0,Pjs were amazingly soft but didn’t fit right at all. I’m 5’7” and the pants were short and the top was short and wide. Very unflattering.
2.0,"Not impressed!  Had no idea it was being shipped from China!  Not the fabric I thought it was, looks cheap and unflattering.  Save your money!  This was a no-go!  At least Amazon refunded me and told me not to return the dress.  A+ for great customer service!"
